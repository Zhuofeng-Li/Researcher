## Summary:

This paper introduces PG-LDS-ID, a novel algorithm designed to model the shared dynamics between two observation processes: a continuous-time Gaussian process and a discrete-time Poisson process. The core idea is to use a latent state-space model to capture the underlying dynamics that influence both observation streams, while also accounting for residual dynamics unique to the Poisson process. The authors propose a two-stage approach, where the first stage identifies the shared dynamics using a covariance-based subspace identification method, and the second stage identifies the residual dynamics that are only observable through the Poisson process. A key contribution is the introduction of a block-structured system matrix, which facilitates the separation of shared and residual dynamics. The method is motivated by applications in neuroscience, where one might want to model the relationship between continuous behavioral trajectories and discrete neural spiking activity. The authors validate their approach using both simulated data and a real-world dataset of non-human primate neural spiking activity and arm movements. The simulation results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to accurately recover the shared dynamics, and the real data experiment shows improved prediction accuracy compared to a prior method, PLDSID. The paper's significance lies in its ability to handle coupled observation processes with different statistical properties, while explicitly disentangling shared and residual dynamics, a capability not simultaneously offered by existing analytical methods. However, the paper's reliance on strong assumptions, such as linearity and a specific block structure, and the limited scope of its experimental validation, raise important questions about its broader applicability and robustness.

## Strengths:

One of the primary strengths of this paper is the novel decomposition technique introduced through Equation (6), which employs a block-structured system matrix. This decomposition is a significant contribution as it simplifies the modeling of shared dynamics between data streams with different statistical properties, specifically Gaussian and Poisson processes. By breaking down the problem into manageable components, the authors enhance the overall approach's ease of handling and implementation. This is particularly valuable in practical scenarios where dealing with coupled dynamics can be complex. Furthermore, the paper's focus on explicitly disentangling shared and residual dynamics is a notable advancement. Existing methods often model the collective dynamics of multiple modalities in the same latent states, whereas PG-LDS-ID explicitly separates the shared dynamics from those unique to the Poisson process. This distinction is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive different observation streams. The authors demonstrate the practical applicability of their method through both simulated and real-world experiments. The simulation results show that the proposed method can accurately recover the shared dynamics, and the real data experiment on non-human primate data shows that PG-LDS-ID achieves better prediction accuracies compared to PLDSID, a prior method. This empirical validation provides evidence for the effectiveness of the algorithm in a realistic setting. Finally, the method's ability to handle generalized linear processes, as opposed to being limited to Gaussian processes, is another strength. By using second-order moments, the proposed method can now deal with a broader class of observation models, making it more versatile and applicable to a wider range of problems.

## Weaknesses:

After a thorough review of the paper and the reviewer comments, I have identified several key weaknesses that significantly impact the paper's conclusions and broader applicability. First, the paper's strong reliance on the assumption of latent linear dynamics is a major limitation. The entire method is built upon linear dynamical state-space models, which, as the authors acknowledge in the 'Limitations' section, can only provide an approximation of nonlinear dynamics. This assumption is particularly concerning given that many real-world systems, especially those in neuroscience, exhibit nonlinear behavior. The authors do not provide any experimental results or analysis of how the method performs when applied to observations generated by a latent nonlinear system. This lack of evaluation makes it difficult to assess the method's robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios. The confidence level for this weakness is high, as the paper explicitly states its reliance on linear models and lacks any analysis of nonlinear systems. Second, the paper introduces a specific block structure in Equation (6) for the system matrices, which is a critical assumption for the method's ability to dissociate shared and residual dynamics. While the authors justify this structure as a design choice to facilitate the separation of dynamics, they do not sufficiently discuss the conditions under which this decomposition can be effectively implemented, or the consequences of deviations from this structure. Specifically, the paper does not explore what happens if the true coefficient matrix has non-zero values in the upper right block, which would violate the assumed block structure. The practical implications of this choice are not fully explored, and the paper lacks any sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the method to such deviations. The confidence level for this weakness is high, as the paper introduces the block structure as a key design choice without addressing its limitations or potential for misapplication. Third, the paper lacks a detailed comparison with recent, relevant subspace identification methods that also leverage multimodal data. The authors compare their method against PLDSID, a method from 2012, but do not compare against more recent techniques such as those presented in Ahmadipour et al. (2023) and Vahidi et al. (2023). This lack of comparison makes it difficult to assess the novelty and specific advantages of the proposed method compared to the current state-of-the-art. The paper mentions that existing methods do not explicitly tease apart shared and residual dynamics, but a more thorough comparison is needed to justify the contribution of this work. The confidence level for this weakness is high, as the paper does not include a comparison with recent, relevant methods. Fourth, the paper does not adequately address the estimation of the Gaussian observation noise variance. While the optimization procedure in Section 3.2.3 ensures valid noise statistics, the explicit estimation of the noise variance of the Gaussian observation process is not clearly outlined as a separate step before the optimization. This omission raises concerns about the method's sensitivity to variations in the noise variance and its impact on the accuracy of the estimated latent states. The confidence level for this weakness is medium, as the paper implicitly addresses noise statistics but does not explicitly detail the estimation of the Gaussian noise variance. Fifth, the paper's experimental evaluation is limited in scope. The authors primarily compare their method against PLDSID and do not include comparisons with more recent and competitive methods. This limited evaluation makes it difficult to assess the proposed algorithm's strengths and weaknesses in the current research landscape. Furthermore, the paper uses only one real-world dataset (NHP data), which limits the assessment of the model's broader applicability. The confidence level for this weakness is high, as the experimental section lacks comparisons with recent methods and uses a limited number of datasets. Finally, the paper claims that the algorithm can be generalized to non-Poisson/non-Gaussian models but does not provide any experimental evidence to support this claim. The paper states that the moment transformation step is key to extending the method, but no results are shown for any other distributions. This lack of empirical evidence makes the claim of generalizability unsubstantiated. The confidence level for this weakness is high, as the claim is made without any supporting experimental results.

## Suggestions:

To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of the method's sensitivity to violations of the linearity assumption. This could involve simulating data from a variety of nonlinear dynamical systems and assessing the accuracy of the estimated latent states and their dimensions. For example, they could use simple nonlinear systems like the Duffing oscillator or the Lorenz attractor to generate synthetic data and then apply their method to this data. The performance of the method could be evaluated by comparing the estimated latent states and their dimensions to the true values. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore how the method's performance changes as the degree of nonlinearity increases. This analysis would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's limitations and its applicability to real-world scenarios where nonlinearities are common. Second, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the method's sensitivity to deviations from the assumed block structure in Equation (6). This could involve simulations where the true coefficient matrix has small non-zero values in the upper right block and assessing whether the method still converges to a reasonable estimate. A sensitivity analysis exploring the robustness of the method to such deviations would be crucial. Furthermore, the paper should provide more guidance on how to choose the dimensions of the latent spaces ($n_1$ and $n_x$). The current description is somewhat vague, and a more concrete procedure, perhaps based on information criteria or cross-validation, would be highly valuable. Third, the authors should include a detailed comparison of their approach with recent subspace identification techniques that use both behavioral and neural data, such as those presented in [1] and [2]. This comparison should include a discussion of the assumptions made by each method, the optimization procedures used, and the types of data that can be handled. For example, the authors should clearly explain how their method differs from the approaches presented in [1] and [2] in terms of the way they model the shared and residual dynamics. They should also discuss the advantages and disadvantages of their method compared to these existing techniques. Fourth, the authors should clarify the role of the noise variance of the Gaussian observation process in their method. They should provide a detailed analysis of the method's sensitivity to variations in the noise variance. This analysis could include simulations with different noise levels and a quantitative assessment of the error in latent state estimation and dimensionality identification. Furthermore, they should discuss how the method's performance is affected by the choice of the noise model. Fifth, the experimental evaluation should be expanded to include comparisons with more recent and competitive methods. While PLDSID is a relevant baseline, the field has seen significant advancements since 2012. Including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, such as more recent deep learning approaches for time series modeling, would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the proposed algorithm's performance. This would not only highlight the strengths of the proposed method but also reveal its limitations and areas for future improvement. Finally, the authors should provide empirical support for their claim that the algorithm can be generalized to non-Poisson/non-Gaussian models. This could involve testing the method on synthetic datasets from simple models with alternative distributions. The authors should also consider including a simple example of how the moment transformation would be derived for a different distribution, such as Bernoulli, to further support their claim.

## Questions:

Several key uncertainties remain after my review of this paper. First, I am particularly interested in the justification for the block structure assumed in Equation (6). While the authors claim this structure does not lose generality, I would like to understand the practical implications of this choice more thoroughly. Specifically, how does the method behave when the true underlying system deviates from this block structure, even slightly? What happens if there are small non-zero values in the upper right block of the coefficient matrix? Does the method still converge to a reasonable estimate, or does it break down? A more detailed explanation of the assumptions underlying this block structure, and a sensitivity analysis exploring its robustness, would be highly beneficial. Second, I am curious about the method's performance when applied to nonlinear systems. The paper acknowledges the limitation of assuming linear dynamics but does not provide any analysis of how the method performs when this assumption is violated. How does the method perform when the underlying system is nonlinear? How does the accuracy of the estimated latent states and their dimensions change as the degree of nonlinearity increases? I would like to see more systematic evaluations of the method's performance under nonlinear conditions. Third, I would like to understand how the method compares to existing approaches that use subspace identification for multimodal data, specifically those mentioned in [1] and [2]. How does the proposed method differ in terms of the assumptions made, the optimization procedures used, and the types of data that can be handled? A more detailed comparison with these methods is needed to justify the specific contribution of this work. Fourth, I am interested in the role of the noise variance of the Gaussian observation process in the method. How does the noise variance affect the accuracy of the estimated latent states and their dimensions? How does the method's performance change as the noise variance varies? A more thorough analysis of the method's sensitivity to variations in the noise variance would be valuable. Finally, I would like to understand the practical limitations of the proposed method. What are the assumptions underlying the method, and when might these assumptions be violated in practice? Are there specific types of dynamical systems for which the method is not suitable? A clear discussion of these limitations would help readers understand the scope of the method and avoid misapplications.
