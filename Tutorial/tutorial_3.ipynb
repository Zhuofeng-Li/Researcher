      "This paper introduces a novel framework for enhancing scientific peer review using Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors propose a system comprising two key components: the Scientific Peer Reviewer Agent (SPRA) and the Human-LLM Reviewer Agent (HLL-RA). SPRA is designed to simulate the peer review process, generating reviews based on a structured JSON configuration and a detailed prompt. HLL-RA, on the other hand, iteratively refines these simulated reviews by incorporating human feedback. This iterative process involves multiple LLMs generating reviews, human evaluators selecting the most appropriate ones, and then using these selected reviews to fine-tune the LLMs. The authors also introduce a new synthetic dataset, Syn-RS, which contains high-quality reviews rated by humans. The core of the methodology involves fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-72B-Chat model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based on the data generated by HLL-RA. The fine-tuned model is then evaluated on the RewardBench benchmark, demonstrating improved performance compared to the base model. The paper also explores the use of the fine-tuned model in simulation-based evaluations and meta-review generation tasks. The overall aim is to align LLMs with human judgment in the context of scientific peer review, thereby potentially improving the efficiency and quality of the review process. The authors present their work as an application of Langley's computational model of scientific discovery, although the connection to this model is not deeply explored. The paper's main empirical findings are centered around the performance of the fine-tuned Qwen2.5-72B-Chat model on RewardBench and other evaluation tasks, showing that the proposed approach can lead to improvements in the model's ability to generate reviews that align with human preferences. The paper also introduces the Syn-RS dataset as a resource for further research in this area. The significance of this work lies in its potential to automate and enhance the scientific peer review process, which is often time-consuming and subject to various biases. By leveraging LLMs and human feedback, the authors aim to create a system that can assist human reviewers and potentially even generate high-quality reviews independently.\n",

      "\n",
      "I find several aspects of this paper to be commendable. The core idea of using LLMs to simulate and enhance the scientific peer review process is both timely and relevant, given the increasing demand for efficient and high-quality review mechanisms. The introduction of the Human-LLM Reviewer Agent (HLL-RA) is a notable contribution, as it attempts to bridge the gap between purely automated review generation and the nuanced judgment of human experts. The iterative approach of HLL-RA, where human feedback is used to refine LLM-generated reviews, is a promising way to align LLMs with human preferences. The creation of the Syn-RS dataset, which contains high-quality reviews rated by humans, is another valuable contribution. This dataset can serve as a resource for future research in this area, enabling the development and evaluation of more sophisticated peer review models. The paper's experimental results, particularly the improvements observed on the RewardBench benchmark after fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-72B-Chat model, demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a clear description of their methodology, including the SPRA configuration, the HLL-RA iterative process, and the fine-tuning procedure. The use of multiple LLMs in the HLL-RA process is also a strength, as it allows the system to capture a broader range of perspectives and insights. The paper's focus on aligning LLMs with human judgment is crucial, as it acknowledges the importance of human expertise in the peer review process. The authors also provide a detailed description of the fine-tuning process, including the use of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and the specific hyperparameters used. The paper's exploration of simulation-based evaluations and meta-review generation tasks further demonstrates the versatility of the proposed approach. Overall, the paper presents a well-structured and well-executed study that makes a valuable contribution to the field of AI-assisted scientific peer review.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the human evaluators involved in the HLL-RA process. The paper mentions that five human evaluators were used, but it provides no information about their expertise, qualifications, or potential biases. This lack of transparency is concerning, as the quality and reliability of the human feedback are crucial to the success of the HLL-RA. Without knowing the background and expertise of the evaluators, it is difficult to assess the validity of the human-aligned reviews. This is a partially valid concern with high confidence, as the paper explicitly mentions the number of evaluators but provides no further details. Second, the paper does not adequately address the potential biases that may be introduced by the HLL-RA process. While the paper aims to align LLMs with human judgment, it does not discuss the possibility that the selected reviews might reflect the subjective preferences or biases of the human evaluators. The paper also fails to explore the impact of the HLL-RA process on the diversity of the generated reviews. It is possible that the iterative optimization process might lead to a convergence of reviews, reducing the variety of perspectives and insights. This is a valid concern with high confidence, as the paper describes the human feedback loop but lacks discussion on potential biases or diversity impact. Third, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing AI reviewer systems. While the related work section mentions several prior studies, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the proposed system differs from and improves upon these existing approaches. This lack of comparative analysis makes it difficult to assess the novelty and significance of the proposed system. This is a valid concern with high confidence, as the related work section lists relevant papers, but the paper lacks a detailed comparative analysis. Fourth, the paper does not provide sufficient details about the ASReview dataset used in the simulation-based evaluations. While the paper mentions that it is a well-known dataset for systematic review, it does not provide specific details about its composition, size, or characteristics. This lack of information makes it difficult to assess the validity and generalizability of the simulation-based results. This is a partially valid concern with high confidence, as the paper mentions the dataset but lacks detailed information. Fifth, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the fine-tuning process. While the paper describes the use of DPO and provides some hyperparameter details, it does not include an ablation study to assess the impact of different components of the fine-tuning process. It also does not explore the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to understand the factors that contribute to the observed performance improvements. This is a partially valid concern with high confidence, as the paper describes the fine-tuning process but lacks ablation studies or hyperparameter sensitivity analysis. Sixth, the paper's connection to Langley's computational model of scientific discovery is not deeply explored. While the paper mentions this model, it does not provide a detailed explanation of how the proposed system aligns with or contributes to this theoretical framework. This lack of theoretical grounding weakens the paper's claim of contributing to the computational model of scientific discovery. This is a valid concern with high confidence, as the paper mentions the model but lacks a detailed explanation of the connection. Finally, the paper does not include a direct comparison of the fine-tuned model's performance against the base models on the Syn-RS dataset itself. While the paper evaluates the model on RewardBench and other tasks, it does not show how the fine-tuning process affects the model's performance on the dataset it was trained on. This is a valid concern with high confidence, as the paper evaluates on other benchmarks but lacks a direct comparison on the Syn-RS dataset itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the identified weaknesses, I propose several concrete suggestions for improving this paper. First, the authors should provide a detailed description of the human evaluators involved in the HLL-RA process. This should include information about their expertise, qualifications, and any potential biases. This would increase the transparency and credibility of the human feedback process. Second, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of the potential biases introduced by the HLL-RA process. This should include an investigation of the diversity of the generated reviews and an assessment of the impact of human preferences on the review content. The authors could also explore methods for mitigating these biases, such as using a more diverse pool of human evaluators or incorporating techniques for promoting review diversity. Third, the authors should provide a detailed comparison of their system with existing AI reviewer systems. This should include a discussion of the specific advantages and disadvantages of their approach compared to other methods. The authors should also clearly articulate the novelty and significance of their contributions. Fourth, the authors should provide more detailed information about the ASReview dataset used in the simulation-based evaluations. This should include specific details about its composition, size, and characteristics. This would allow for a better assessment of the validity and generalizability of the simulation-based results. Fifth, the authors should conduct a more detailed analysis of the fine-tuning process. This should include an ablation study to assess the impact of different components of the fine-tuning process and an exploration of the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings. This would provide a better understanding of the factors that contribute to the observed performance improvements. Sixth, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of how their system aligns with or contributes to Langley's computational model of scientific discovery. This should include a discussion of the specific ways in which their system embodies the principles of this model. This would strengthen the theoretical grounding of their work. Finally, the authors should include a direct comparison of the fine-tuned model's performance against the base models on the Syn-RS dataset itself. This would provide a more direct assessment of the impact of the fine-tuning process on the model's ability to generate high-quality reviews. In addition to these specific suggestions, I also recommend that the authors consider expanding the scope of their work to include other aspects of the peer review process, such as reviewer assignment and meta-review generation. This would demonstrate the versatility of their approach and its potential to address a broader range of challenges in scientific peer review. I also suggest that the authors explore the use of different LLMs in their system and compare their performance. This would provide a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of different LLMs in the context of scientific peer review. Finally, I recommend that the authors consider the ethical implications of their work, particularly the potential for bias and misuse of AI-generated reviews. This would demonstrate a responsible approach to the development and deployment of AI-assisted peer review systems.\n",

      "This paper introduces MARP, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate the traditional peer review process. The core idea is to have multiple LLM agents, each adopting a specific role (e.g., statistician, domain expert, methodologist), independently review an academic paper, provide feedback to one another, and iteratively refine their assessments. This process aims to mimic the diverse perspectives and iterative nature of human peer review. The authors also incorporate an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm, which fine-tunes a reward model based on the quality of the reviews, to enhance the accuracy of the final consensus conclusion. The experimental results, conducted on a dataset of NeurIPS papers, demonstrate that MARP outperforms single LLM baselines in predicting paper acceptance, suggesting the potential of this approach to assist and improve the peer review process. The authors present both qualitative examples of the generated reviews and quantitative results, including ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of the framework. The paper's main contribution lies in the novel application of a multi-agent system to the task of automated peer review, offering a potentially more robust and nuanced approach than previous methods that rely on single LLM agents. The iterative feedback mechanism and the use of a reward model further distinguish MARP from existing approaches. The authors argue that MARP can help address some of the limitations of the current peer review system, such as human bias and inefficiency, by providing a more objective and scalable alternative. However, the paper also acknowledges that the technology is not yet at a stage where it can fully replace human reviewers, but rather serve as a valuable tool to assist them. The overall significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize the way academic papers are reviewed, making the process more efficient, fair, and transparent. By demonstrating the feasibility of using LLMs to simulate peer review, the paper opens up new avenues for research in this area and provides a valuable contribution to the growing field of AI-assisted academic workflows.\n",

      "I find the core idea of using a multi-agent system to simulate the peer review process to be a significant strength of this paper. The approach of having multiple LLM agents, each with a specific role, independently review a paper and then provide feedback to one another is a novel and promising way to mimic the diverse perspectives and iterative nature of human peer review. This is a clear improvement over previous methods that rely on single LLM agents, as it allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive evaluation of the paper. The incorporation of an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm to fine-tune a reward model based on the quality of the reviews is another notable strength. This mechanism allows the system to learn what constitutes a good review and to iteratively improve the quality of the generated reviews. The experimental results, which demonstrate that MARP outperforms single LLM baselines in predicting paper acceptance, provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The ablation studies further strengthen the paper by analyzing the impact of different components of the framework, such as the number of agents and the number of iterations. The qualitative examples of the generated reviews also demonstrate the potential of MARP to produce insightful and detailed feedback. The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, which makes it accessible to a broad audience. The authors clearly articulate the problem they are addressing, the proposed solution, and the experimental results. The use of figures and tables also helps to visualize the proposed method and the experimental results. Overall, I believe that the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of AI-assisted peer review by introducing a novel and effective multi-agent framework.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "While I appreciate the novelty of the proposed multi-agent framework, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant further discussion. Firstly, the paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with existing single-agent methods. While the authors do compare MARP against ChatGPT-3.5, this is not sufficient to fully contextualize the performance of their approach. The paper mentions other single-agent methods in the related work section, such as those using role-based interactions, but these are not included as baselines in the experimental evaluation. This omission makes it difficult to assess the true advantage of the multi-agent approach over other existing methods. The absence of a detailed comparison with these methods weakens the paper's claim of novelty and effectiveness. Secondly, the paper's evaluation is limited to a single dataset of NeurIPS papers. While this dataset is relevant to the task of peer review, it is not sufficient to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method. The paper does not discuss the potential for applying MARP to other domains or types of academic papers. This lack of evaluation on diverse datasets raises concerns about the robustness of the approach and its ability to perform well in different contexts. Furthermore, the paper does not adequately address the potential for bias in the LLMs used for the review process. While the authors acknowledge that human biases are a limitation of the current peer review system, they do not discuss the possibility that LLMs might also exhibit biases. The paper does not describe any measures taken to mitigate bias in the LLMs or to ensure fairness in the review process. This is a significant concern, as biased reviews could undermine the credibility of the proposed method. The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method. The multi-agent framework, with its iterative feedback mechanism, is likely to be computationally expensive. The paper does not provide any information about the computational resources required to run MARP or the time it takes to generate a review. This lack of information makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed method. Additionally, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the reward model is used to generate the final consensus conclusion. While the paper describes two methods for aggregating the final reviews, it does not explain how the reward model influences this process. The connection between the reward model and the consensus conclusion is not clear, which makes it difficult to understand how the system ensures the quality of the final output. Finally, the paper does not adequately address the limitations of using LLMs to simulate human peer review. While the authors acknowledge that LLMs are not yet capable of fully replacing human reviewers, they do not fully explore the potential for LLMs to miss subtle cues or implicit assumptions that human reviewers might pick up on. The paper does not discuss the potential for LLMs to make errors in judgment or to overlook important aspects of a paper. This lack of discussion about the limitations of the approach weakens the paper's overall credibility. I have a high confidence in these limitations, as they are directly observable from the paper's content and have a substantial impact on the conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. Firstly, the authors should include a more comprehensive comparison with existing single-agent methods in their experimental evaluation. This would involve implementing and evaluating several state-of-the-art single-agent baselines, such as those using role-based interactions, and comparing their performance against MARP on the same dataset. This would provide a more robust assessment of the advantages of the multi-agent approach. Secondly, the authors should evaluate their method on a more diverse set of datasets. This would involve testing MARP on papers from different domains and with different characteristics. This would help to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method and its ability to perform well in different contexts. Thirdly, the authors should address the potential for bias in the LLMs used for the review process. This could involve using techniques to mitigate bias in the LLMs or incorporating mechanisms to detect and correct biased reviews. The authors should also discuss the ethical implications of using LLMs for peer review and the potential for bias to undermine the fairness of the process. Fourthly, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method. This would involve reporting the computational resources required to run MARP, the time it takes to generate a review, and the scalability of the approach. This information is crucial for assessing the practical feasibility of the proposed method. Fifthly, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of how the reward model is used to generate the final consensus conclusion. This would involve describing the connection between the reward model and the aggregation of the final reviews, and explaining how the system ensures the quality of the final output. The authors should also provide more details about the training process of the reward model, including the specific loss function used and the hyperparameter tuning process. Finally, the authors should provide a more thorough discussion of the limitations of using LLMs to simulate human peer review. This would involve acknowledging the potential for LLMs to miss subtle cues or implicit assumptions, to make errors in judgment, or to overlook important aspects of a paper. The authors should also discuss the potential for LLMs to generate reviews that are superficial or lack the depth of human insight. This discussion should be grounded in specific examples from the experiments, highlighting instances where MARP either succeeded or failed in a manner that is directly comparable to human reviewer behavior. These suggestions are directly connected to the identified weaknesses and are aimed at improving the robustness, generalizability, and credibility of the proposed method.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for further understanding and improving the proposed method. Firstly, how does the performance of MARP vary when using different LLMs for the agent roles? The paper mentions using different LLMs, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of how the choice of LLM affects the performance of the system. Understanding this would be crucial for optimizing the system's performance. Secondly, what is the impact of the specific prompts used for each agent role on the quality of the generated reviews? The paper does not provide the specific prompts used, and it is likely that the quality of the prompts has a significant impact on the performance of the system. A sensitivity analysis of the prompts would be valuable. Thirdly, how does the system handle situations where the agents disagree on the quality of a paper? The paper mentions that the system aggregates the final reviews to form a consensus conclusion, but it does not explain how the system resolves disagreements among the agents. Understanding this would be crucial for assessing the robustness of the system. Fourthly, how does the system ensure that the generated reviews are original and not simply reproductions of existing content from the internet? The paper does not address the potential for the LLMs to generate reviews that are not original, which is a significant concern. Fifthly, what is the optimal number of agents and iterations for achieving the best performance? The paper mentions that three agents and three iterations yielded the highest accuracy, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of how these parameters affect the performance of the system. A more thorough analysis of these parameters would be valuable. Finally, how can the system be improved to better capture the subtle cues and implicit assumptions that human reviewers might pick up on? The paper acknowledges that LLMs are not yet capable of fully replacing human reviewers, but it does not provide specific suggestions for how to bridge this gap. Addressing this question would be crucial for advancing the field of AI-assisted peer review. These questions target core methodological choices and seek clarification of critical assumptions, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of the proposed method and its limitations.\n",

      "This paper introduces RALS (Referees in AI for Scientific Peer Review), a novel system designed to automate the scientific peer review process using Large Language Models (LLMs). The core idea is to leverage LLMs to generate comprehensive reviews, encompassing tasks such as reading, analyzing, and criticizing research papers, followed by an iterative self-refinement process. The authors propose a four-stage pipeline: first, the LLM reads and summarizes the paper; second, it analyzes the paper's contributions, strengths, and weaknesses; third, it launches detailed criticisms; and finally, it refines the review through self-critique. This iterative self-refinement process is a key aspect of the approach, allowing the LLM to act as both reviewer and critic, thereby enhancing the quality and depth of the generated reviews. The authors evaluated RALS using a dataset of 169 reviewed AI/ML papers from top conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, and ACL. They employed three different LLMs—GPT-4, Qwen2.5-72B, and Mistral—to generate reviews and compared them against human reviews through human evaluation. The results indicate that GPT-4 generated reviews are often preferred over human reviews by both domain experts and the general public, suggesting the potential of RALS to complement or even automate aspects of the peer review process. Furthermore, the paper explores the use of RALS as a reward model, demonstrating its ability to infer review scores from review texts. The authors also conducted ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component of the pipeline, highlighting the importance of the iterative self-refinement process. Overall, the paper presents a significant step towards automating scientific peer review, with potential implications for research quality control, discovery, and the research paradigm. However, the authors also acknowledge the limitations of their approach, particularly in terms of the generalizability of the system to other domains and the potential for bias in the generated reviews. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for further research to address these limitations and to explore the broader implications of using LLMs in scientific peer review.\n",

      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. First, the core idea of using LLMs to automate the scientific peer review process is both novel and highly relevant. The authors have identified a critical bottleneck in the scientific publishing ecosystem and have proposed a creative solution that leverages the capabilities of LLMs. The proposed RALS system, with its four-stage pipeline and iterative self-refinement process, is a well-structured approach to this complex problem. The iterative self-refinement process, where the LLM acts as both reviewer and critic, is a particularly innovative aspect of the work. This approach allows the LLM to generate more comprehensive and insightful reviews by iteratively improving the quality of the generated text. The experimental evaluation of RALS is another strength of the paper. The authors have conducted a thorough evaluation using a dataset of 169 reviewed AI/ML papers from top conferences. They have used three different LLMs to generate reviews and have compared them against human reviews through human evaluation. The results, which show that GPT-4 generated reviews are often preferred over human reviews, are compelling and suggest the potential of RALS to complement or even automate aspects of the peer review process. Furthermore, the authors have explored the use of RALS as a reward model, demonstrating its ability to infer review scores from review texts. This is a significant finding that highlights the versatility of the proposed approach. The ablation studies, which assess the contribution of each component of the pipeline, are also well-designed and provide valuable insights into the importance of the iterative self-refinement process. Finally, the authors have acknowledged the limitations of their approach and have proposed several avenues for future research. This demonstrates a commitment to responsible research practices and a recognition of the challenges involved in automating scientific peer review.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper's reliance on a single dataset of AI/ML papers from top conferences raises concerns about the generalizability of the RALS system. The authors explicitly state that they used the NeurIPS Review Dataset, which contains papers from NeurIPS, ICML, and ACL (Section 4.1). This narrow focus limits the system's ability to handle the diverse methodologies, evaluation metrics, and writing styles found in other scientific disciplines. As the authors themselves acknowledge in the \"Limitations and Future Directions\" section (Section 6.3), the performance of RALS on papers from other domains is unknown. This is a critical limitation because the language and structure of a review in, say, experimental physics or social sciences, can differ significantly from those in AI/ML. The system's effectiveness may be severely limited when applied to fields with different conventions, and this lack of generalizability undermines the claim of broad applicability. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is directly supported by the paper's description of the dataset and the authors' own acknowledgments. Second, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the types of errors or biases that the system might introduce. While the authors mention the potential for bias in human reviews (Introduction), they do not provide a concrete analysis of how RALS might perpetuate or amplify existing biases in scientific evaluation. The absence of such an analysis is a significant oversight, as it is crucial to understand the potential for the system to inadvertently favor certain methodologies, perspectives, or even institutions. The paper does not include any experiments specifically designed to identify and mitigate these biases. This is a critical limitation, as it could lead to unfair or inaccurate evaluations. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is based on the absence of any discussion or experiments related to bias analysis. Third, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required by RALS. The authors mention using GPT-4, Qwen2.5-72B, and Mistral (Section 4.2), but they do not discuss the computational cost associated with running these models, nor do they compare it to the resources required for human review. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the system, especially for large-scale applications. The computational cost of running large language models can be substantial, and the paper needs to address this aspect in more detail. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is based on the absence of any discussion or experiments related to computational resource analysis. Fourth, the paper's evaluation metrics, while including human evaluation, could be more comprehensive. The authors use metrics such as preference over human reviews, helpfulness, correctness, relevance, and review length (Section 4.3). However, they do not include metrics that assess the novelty or creativity of the reviews, which are important aspects of a good review. The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the correlation between the automated metrics and human judgments of review quality. This is a limitation because it is not clear how well the chosen metrics capture the full spectrum of what constitutes a good review. My confidence in this limitation is medium, as the paper does include human evaluation, but lacks more nuanced metrics. Fifth, the paper does not include a comparison with other existing automated review systems or LLM-based review generation methods. The authors compare RALS against human reviews and some ablations (Section 4.4), but they do not benchmark their system against other state-of-the-art approaches. This lack of comparison makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of RALS and to determine its advantages and disadvantages compared to other methods. This is a critical limitation, as it is essential to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing alternatives. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is based on the absence of any comparison with other automated review systems. Finally, the paper lacks sufficient detail regarding the human evaluation process. While the authors mention using a survey adapted from a NeurIPS publication (Section 4.3), they do not provide the specific survey questions or detailed procedures. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the validity of the human evaluation results. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is based on the absence of specific survey questions and detailed procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should significantly expand the evaluation of RALS to include datasets from diverse scientific disciplines. This would involve curating or generating datasets of reviewed papers from fields such as experimental physics, biology, and social sciences. The evaluation should not only focus on the overall preference of reviews but also on the system's ability to identify key methodological strengths and weaknesses, which can vary significantly across disciplines. For example, in experimental physics, the focus might be on the precision and accuracy of measurements, while in social sciences, the emphasis might be on the validity of the research design and the interpretation of qualitative data. A detailed analysis of how RALS performs in these different contexts would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its capabilities and limitations. Second, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of the types of errors and biases that the system might introduce. This would involve examining the system's reviews for instances where it might misinterpret methodological choices, overemphasize certain aspects of the paper while neglecting others, or exhibit biases towards specific topics or approaches. The authors should also explore the system's ability to handle nuanced arguments and subtle critiques, which are often crucial in scientific reviews. This analysis should include specific examples of both successful and unsuccessful reviews generated by RALS, highlighting the factors that contributed to these outcomes. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the potential for the system to perpetuate existing biases in scientific evaluation, such as biases towards certain methodologies, perspectives, or even institutions. This could involve comparing the system's reviews with human reviews and analyzing any discrepancies in terms of the aspects of the paper that are emphasized or downplayed. Third, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required by RALS. This should include an assessment of the time and resources needed to generate a review, as well as a comparison with the resources required for human review. The authors should also explore the scalability of the system and its ability to handle large volumes of review requests. This analysis should consider the practical implications of deploying RALS in real-world scenarios and identify any potential bottlenecks or limitations. Fourth, the authors should incorporate more comprehensive evaluation metrics that assess the novelty and creativity of the reviews. This could involve using metrics that measure the diversity of the generated text or the introduction of new perspectives. The authors should also conduct a more detailed analysis of the correlation between the automated metrics and human judgments of review quality. This would involve comparing the system's reviews with human reviews and analyzing the aspects of the paper that are emphasized or downplayed. Fifth, the authors should benchmark RALS against other existing automated review systems or LLM-based review generation methods. This would involve comparing the performance of RALS with other state-of-the-art approaches using the same evaluation metrics. This comparison would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of RALS. Finally, the authors should provide more details regarding the human evaluation process. This should include the specific survey questions used, the instructions given to the evaluators, and the procedures used to ensure the quality of the human evaluation. This would enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the results.\n",

      "I have several questions that arise from my analysis of this paper. First, given the potential for bias in the training data, how can the authors ensure that RALS does not perpetuate or amplify existing biases in scientific evaluation? This is a critical concern, as it could lead to unfair or inaccurate evaluations. Second, how does RALS handle the subjective nature of some review aspects, such as the perceived significance or novelty of a contribution? While the authors mention that the survey included questions about helpfulness, readability, and trustworthiness (Section 4.3), it is not clear how these subjective aspects are addressed in the evaluation. Third, what are the specific limitations of the self-refinement process, and how can these limitations be addressed? The paper mentions that the self-refinement process can sometimes lead to reviews becoming overly positive (Section 6.3), but it does not provide a detailed analysis of the mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon. Fourth, how does the performance of RALS vary across different types of papers, such as theoretical vs. empirical studies, or papers with different levels of complexity? The paper's evaluation is limited to AI/ML papers, and it is not clear how the system would perform on papers with different characteristics. Fifth, what are the ethical implications of using LLMs to automate scientific peer review, and how can these implications be addressed? This is a critical question, as the use of LLMs in this context could have significant societal impacts. Finally, what are the specific steps that the authors plan to take to address the limitations of their approach and to explore the broader implications of using LLMs in scientific peer review? The paper mentions several avenues for future research, but it would be helpful to have a more detailed roadmap for future work.\n",

      "This paper introduces the AI Reviewer Agent (AIRA), a system designed to automate the generation of scientific peer reviews using large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a multi-agent architecture, where different agents are responsible for reading the paper, taking notes, summarizing feedback, and generating the final review. To evaluate the performance of AIRA, they also introduce the AI Review Assessment (AIRA) benchmark, a multiple-choice questionnaire designed to assess various aspects of review quality. The authors conduct experiments using the ICML 2024 conference dataset, comparing AI-generated reviews with human reviews. Their findings suggest that AIRA can generate reviews that are perceived as comparable to human-written reviews, particularly when aligned with advanced models and collaborative prompting strategies. However, the study also reveals that human reviewers are still preferred in domains outside of AI. The authors contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 640 reviews generated by both humans and AI, aiming to facilitate further research in this area. The core contribution of this work lies in the development of an AI-powered system for automating the peer review process and the introduction of a benchmark for evaluating the quality of these AI-generated reviews. The authors explore the potential of LLMs to assist in the review process, while also acknowledging the limitations and challenges of this approach. The paper's significance lies in its attempt to address the growing need for efficient and effective peer review processes in the face of increasing research output. However, the paper's reliance on a single dataset and the lack of detailed analysis of the AI system's performance raise questions about the generalizability and robustness of the findings. The authors also acknowledge the potential for AI reviewers to game the evaluation process, which is a critical ethical consideration. Overall, this paper presents a valuable initial step towards automating the peer review process, but it also highlights the need for further research and development in this area.\n",

The multi-agent architecture, while not fully detailed, presents an interesting approach to structuring the review generation process. The introduction of the AI Review Assessment (AIRA) benchmark is another notable contribution. This multiple-choice questionnaire provides a structured way to evaluate the quality of reviews, and the authors' efforts to validate this benchmark through a large-scale human evaluation are commendable. The collection of a comprehensive dataset of over 640 reviews, including both human and AI-generated reviews, is a valuable resource for the research community. This dataset will undoubtedly facilitate further research in this area and contribute to the development of more robust AI reviewer agents. The authors' exploration of transfer learning and multi-agent collaboration techniques to align LLMs with the AI academic community is also a positive aspect of this work. The experimental results, while not without limitations, demonstrate the potential of LLMs to generate reviews that are perceived as comparable to human-written reviews, particularly in the AI domain. The authors' acknowledgment of the limitations of their approach, such as the potential for AI reviewers to game the evaluation process, is also a strength, as it demonstrates a responsible and ethical approach to research. Finally, the authors' commitment to making their dataset publicly available will further enhance the impact of their work and promote collaboration within the research community.\n",

      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several significant weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper suffers from a lack of clarity and organization, particularly in the presentation of its methodology and experimental setup. The introduction of two entities with the same acronym, AIRA, is confusing and makes it difficult to distinguish between the AI Reviewer Agent system and the AI Review Assessment benchmark. This lack of clarity extends to the description of the AIRA system itself. While the authors describe a multi-agent architecture, the specific roles and interactions of these agents are not clearly defined. The paper lacks detailed prompt templates for each agent, making it difficult to understand how the system is implemented and how its performance can be replicated. The experimental setup is also not clearly articulated. The authors do not provide sufficient details on how the human reviewers were selected, what instructions they were given, and how their reviews were collected. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the validity of the human review baseline. Furthermore, the paper's reliance on a single dataset from ICML 2024 raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. The authors do not provide any evidence to support the claim that their benchmark is generalizable to other academic domains or conferences. The evaluation methodology also presents a significant weakness. The use of a multiple-choice questionnaire to assess review quality is overly simplistic and fails to capture the nuances of effective peer review. The authors do not provide a detailed justification for the design of their questionnaire, nor do they compare it to other evaluation methods. The paper also lacks a thorough analysis of the AI system's performance. While the authors present results comparing AI-generated and human reviews, they do not delve into the specific strengths and weaknesses of the AI system. There is no detailed error analysis, no discussion of the types of errors the AI system makes, and no comparison of the AI-generated reviews with human reviews on a case-by-case basis. This lack of in-depth analysis makes it difficult to understand the limitations of the AI system and identify areas for improvement. The paper also lacks a clear articulation of its research focus. It is unclear whether the primary contribution is the development of the AIRA system, the introduction of the AIRA benchmark, or an empirical study of LLMs as reviewers. This lack of focus makes it difficult to assess the paper's overall contribution. Finally, the paper's discussion of the potential for AI reviewers to game the evaluation process is not adequately addressed. While the authors acknowledge this risk, they do not provide any concrete solutions or mitigation strategies. The paper also lacks a discussion of other ethical considerations, such as the potential for bias in AI-generated reviews. These weaknesses, taken together, significantly undermine the paper's claims and limit its overall impact. I have a high level of confidence in these identified weaknesses, as they are directly supported by my analysis of the paper's content and structure.\n",

      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should clearly distinguish between the AIRA system and the AIRA benchmark throughout the paper. This could be achieved by using different names for the system and the benchmark, or by consistently using full names instead of acronyms. Second, the authors should provide a more detailed description of the AIRA system's architecture, including the specific roles and interactions of each agent. This should include detailed prompt templates for each agent, as well as a clear explanation of how the system is implemented. Third, the authors should provide more details on the experimental setup, including the selection criteria for human reviewers, the instructions they were given, and the process for collecting their reviews. This should include information on the experts' credentials and the process for selecting the 'best' and 'worst' reviews. Fourth, the authors should expand their evaluation to include datasets from other academic domains and conferences. This would help to assess the generalizability of their benchmark and the performance of their AI system. Fifth, the authors should provide a more detailed justification for the design of their questionnaire, and they should compare it to other evaluation methods. This should include a discussion of the validity and reliability of the questionnaire. Sixth, the authors should conduct a more in-depth analysis of the AI system's performance.

Do they envision AI as a replacement for human reviewers, or as a tool to assist and enhance the review process? These questions are aimed at clarifying key uncertainties and assumptions, and they are critical to understanding the paper's overall contribution and implications.\n",

      "This paper introduces a novel framework for AI-assisted peer review, proposing three distinct systems: AIReviewer, AIReviewerStar, and AIReviewerPlus. The core idea is to leverage large language models (LLMs) to simulate and enhance the traditional peer review process. AIReviewer serves as the foundational model, trained using historical review data and employing a reasoning module to generate latent decisions, which are then transformed into structured reviews by an execution module. AIReviewerStar builds upon this by incorporating direct preference optimization (DPO), aiming to align the generated reviews more closely with human expert reviews. Finally, AIReviewerPlus further refines the process by integrating author feedback to iteratively improve review quality. The authors evaluate these systems through a series of experiments, including paper state encoding, review criteria encoding, review generation, and review quality evaluation. They use the NEURIPS 2023 dataset for training and testing, comparing their models against several baselines, including GPT-4 and other LLMs. The results suggest that the proposed AIReviewer systems can generate detailed and consistent reviews, with AIReviewerStar outperforming existing LLM-based review systems and AIReviewerPlus accelerating the feedback loop between authors and reviewers. The paper also introduces a collaborative platform, 'https://reviewerplus.io', to facilitate the practical application of their work. Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to automating and improving the peer review process, although several limitations need to be addressed to ensure its robustness and reliability.\n",

      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly compelling. First, the paper tackles a significant and timely problem: the need to improve the efficiency and quality of the scientific peer review process. The authors' approach of using LLMs to simulate and enhance this process is both innovative and practical. The proposed AIReviewer framework, with its three distinct systems, demonstrates a clear progression of ideas, starting with a basic model and incrementally adding features to improve performance. The use of historical review data to train AIReviewer is a logical approach, and the incorporation of DPO in AIReviewerStar and author feedback in AIReviewerPlus are well-motivated. The experimental results, while not without limitations, show that the proposed systems can generate detailed and consistent reviews, and that AIReviewerStar and AIReviewerPlus offer improvements over existing LLM-based systems. The paper also makes a valuable contribution by providing a dataset and benchmark for future research in this area. The inclusion of a collaborative platform, 'https://reviewerplus.io', further highlights the practical relevance of this work and its potential for real-world application. The authors' focus on optimizing review quality through reward and feedback mechanisms is a significant step towards creating more reliable and efficient peer review systems.

      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks sufficient detail regarding the training process of AIReviewer. While the authors mention using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and LoRA for training, they do not specify the LLM backbone used, the exact hyperparameters, or the training time. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and assess the robustness of the model. Furthermore, the paper does not include a direct comparison of the training cost of AIReviewer with other models, which is a critical factor in evaluating its practicality. The absence of a discussion on the computational resources required for training, such as GPU memory usage and training time per epoch, further limits the transparency of the training process. My confidence in this issue is high, as the missing details are fundamental for reproducibility and practical application. Second, the paper's evaluation methodology raises concerns about potential overfitting. The authors use the NEURIPS 2023 dataset for both training and testing, with a random split of 3:1:1. This approach does not guarantee that the test set represents unseen data, and the high accuracy scores on the test set raise suspicion that the model may have memorized the training data. The lack of cross-validation or other techniques to ensure the generalizability of the results further exacerbates this concern. My confidence in this issue is also high, as the use of the same dataset for training and testing without proper separation is a well-known cause of overfitting. Third, the paper's evaluation of review quality relies heavily on LLM-based metrics, which are not always reliable. While the authors use GPT-4 and Qwen2.5-110B to evaluate the quality of generated reviews, they do not include a human evaluation study to validate these results. This lack of human assessment makes it difficult to determine the true quality of the generated reviews, especially in terms of constructiveness and thoroughness. The absence of human evaluation is a significant limitation, as LLM-based evaluations may not fully capture the nuances of human judgment. My confidence in this issue is high, as human evaluation is a crucial component of assessing the quality of peer reviews. Fourth, the paper's explanation of the 'order-n reasoning' module is vague and lacks technical depth. The authors describe it as analyzing inputs and producing a latent decision, but they do not provide a detailed explanation of how this module functions, its architecture, or its training process. The lack of a concrete example or a more detailed explanation makes it difficult to understand the module's contribution to the overall system. My confidence in this issue is high, as the lack of clarity hinders the understanding of a core component of the proposed system. Fifth, the paper does not adequately address the potential for bias in the generated reviews. While the authors acknowledge this risk in the limitations section, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the types of biases that might be present in the training data or how these biases might manifest in the generated reviews. The absence of a discussion on mitigation strategies further limits the paper's ability to address this critical concern. My confidence in this issue is high, as bias in training data is a well-known problem that can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Finally, the paper lacks sufficient detail regarding the collaborative platform, 'https://reviewerplus.io'. The authors mention deploying AIReviewerStar on this platform, but they do not provide details about its architecture, user interface, or how it integrates with existing submission systems. This lack of information makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed system. My confidence in this issue is high, as the lack of details limits the understanding of the practical application of the proposed system.\n",

      "This paper introduces SimPEER, a novel dataset of 2,000 simulated peer reviews based on machine learning papers from NeurIPS and ICLR conferences. The authors employ a multi-agent simulation approach, using GPT-4o to generate both single-agent and multi-turn review interactions. The core idea is to leverage these simulations to train a specialized automated reviewer agent, named ARA, which is based on the Mistral-7B model. The training process involves two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the generated SimPEER dataset, followed by preference optimization (PO) using human preferences. The resulting model, ARA-PO, is evaluated against commercial large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5. The authors demonstrate that ARA-PO generates higher-quality reviews, as assessed by human annotators, and shows competitive performance in predicting paper acceptance decisions. The paper's primary contribution lies in the creation of the SimPEER dataset and the demonstration of a two-stage training approach for optimizing a reviewer agent. The authors emphasize the potential of their work to enhance the efficiency and quality of the peer review process, particularly in the field of machine learning. However, the paper also acknowledges the limitations of simulated data and the need for further research to address potential biases and ethical concerns. The methodology involves using GPT-4o to simulate reviewer interactions, which are then used to fine-tune the ARA model. The preference optimization stage incorporates human feedback to further refine the model's performance. The evaluation includes both human assessments of review quality and comparisons of acceptance decision predictions. The paper's findings suggest that the proposed approach can effectively leverage simulated data to train a competitive reviewer agent, but also highlights the challenges and limitations of this approach. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of automated peer review, but also raises important questions about the reliability and generalizability of the proposed methods.\n",

      "The paper's primary strength lies in the introduction of the SimPEER dataset, a valuable resource for researchers interested in automated peer review. The dataset, comprising 2,000 simulated reviews based on real machine learning papers, provides a foundation for training and evaluating reviewer agents. The authors' approach of using multi-agent simulations to generate this data is a notable contribution, as it attempts to capture the interactive nature of real-world peer review. Furthermore, the paper's two-stage training methodology, involving supervised fine-tuning followed by preference optimization, is a well-structured approach that leverages both the simulated data and human preferences. The empirical results, demonstrating that the ARA-PO model outperforms commercial LLMs in generating high-quality reviews, are compelling. The human evaluation of review quality, which shows that ARA-PO receives higher scores than GPT-4o and Qwen2.5, provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper also demonstrates the model's ability to predict paper acceptance decisions, further highlighting its potential utility. The authors' clear presentation of the methodology and experimental setup facilitates understanding and reproducibility. The inclusion of both human evaluations and quantitative metrics provides a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. The paper's focus on a critical aspect of scientific progress, the peer review process, is also a significant strength. By addressing the challenges of automating this process, the authors contribute to a timely and important area of research. The use of a multi-agent simulation approach, which attempts to model the interactive nature of peer review, is a novel contribution that distinguishes this work from previous efforts. The paper's emphasis on using human preferences to refine the model's performance is also a positive aspect, as it acknowledges the importance of human judgment in the peer review process. The authors' clear articulation of the paper's contributions and limitations also enhances its overall quality. Finally, the paper's focus on a practical application of large language models, specifically in the context of peer review, makes it a relevant and impactful contribution to the field.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, several weaknesses warrant careful consideration. A primary concern is the heavy reliance on simulated data for training the reviewer agent. As the reviewers have pointed out, the use of GPT-4o to generate the SimPEER dataset introduces the potential for biases and inaccuracies to propagate into the trained model. The paper acknowledges this limitation, but the extent to which these biases affect the model's performance is not fully explored. The lack of experiments comparing the performance of ARA-PO when trained on simulated versus real-world peer review data makes it difficult to assess the true value of the proposed approach. This is a critical omission, as it leaves open the question of whether the model's performance is due to its ability to learn from real peer review interactions or simply from mimicking the style of the simulated data. The paper's evaluation methodology also presents some weaknesses. The human evaluation of review quality, while providing valuable insights, is based on researchers and students from top ML labs, not actual program committee (PC) members. This raises concerns about the external validity of the results, as these annotators may not have the same level of experience or perspective as actual PC members. The paper does not provide any justification for why these annotators were chosen over PC members, nor does it analyze the potential impact of this choice on the evaluation results. Furthermore, the paper's approach of comparing LLM-generated reviews with human annotations, rather than directly comparing the LLM's output to actual human reviews, limits the ability to assess the model's performance in a real-world context. The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the human preference data used for preference optimization. The process by which human annotators indicated their preferences between pairs of reviews is not described in sufficient detail, and the paper does not provide any information about the inter-annotator agreement. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the reliability of the human preference data and its impact on the model's performance. The paper's claim that the proposed method can accelerate the scientific discovery process is not supported by any empirical evidence. While the paper demonstrates the model's ability to generate high-quality reviews and predict acceptance decisions, it does not provide any evidence that using the model would actually lead to faster scientific progress. This claim is purely speculative and should be removed or supported with further evidence. The paper also does not adequately address the potential for the model to be used for unethical purposes, such as generating fake reviews or manipulating the peer review process. While the paper mentions ethical considerations in the limitations section, it does not provide a detailed discussion of these risks or propose any mitigation strategies. The paper's reliance on the Bayesopt leaderboard for evaluating acceptance decision prediction is also problematic. The paper does not provide a justification for why this specific leaderboard was chosen, nor does it address the potential biases associated with it. The use of a different dataset and metric from those used in the work that developed the leaderboard further complicates the interpretation of the results. Finally, the paper's lack of a dedicated background section on AI for peer review makes it difficult for readers unfamiliar with this area to fully appreciate the context and significance of the work. The paper jumps directly into the methodology without providing a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on AI for peer review. These weaknesses, taken together, raise significant concerns about the reliability, generalizability, and practical implications of the proposed approach. The lack of comparison with real-world data, the limitations of the evaluation methodology, and the absence of a thorough analysis of the human preference data all contribute to these concerns. The speculative claims about accelerating scientific discovery and the lack of discussion about potential ethical risks further weaken the paper's overall impact.\n",

      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First and foremost, the authors should conduct experiments comparing the performance of ARA-PO when trained on real-world peer review data versus simulated data. This would provide crucial insights into the value of the proposed simulation approach and help to quantify the impact of potential biases in the simulated data. If real-world data is not readily available, the authors should explore methods for mitigating the biases in the simulated data, such as using diverse prompts or incorporating human feedback during the simulation process. Second, the authors should conduct a more rigorous evaluation of the model's performance using actual program committee (PC) members as annotators. This would provide a more realistic assessment of the model's ability to generate high-quality reviews and would address the concerns about the external validity of the current evaluation. If it is not possible to recruit PC members, the authors should at least provide a detailed analysis of the potential impact of using non-PC members as annotators. This analysis should include a comparison of the ratings provided by the two groups, if possible, and a discussion of the potential biases introduced by using non-PC members. Third, the authors should provide a more detailed description of the human preference data collection process. This should include information about the instructions given to the annotators, the specific criteria they used to indicate their preferences, and the inter-annotator agreement. This would help to assess the reliability of the human preference data and its impact on the model's performance. Fourth, the authors should remove the speculative claim about accelerating scientific discovery or provide empirical evidence to support it. This could involve conducting experiments to measure the time taken to complete the peer review process with and without the use of the proposed model. Fifth, the authors should include a more detailed discussion of the potential ethical risks associated with the proposed approach. This discussion should include specific examples of how the model could be used for unethical purposes and propose mitigation strategies to address these risks. Sixth, the authors should provide a justification for the use of the Bayesopt leaderboard for evaluating acceptance decision prediction and address the potential biases associated with it. This could involve comparing the results obtained using the Bayesopt leaderboard with those obtained using other metrics or datasets. Seventh, the authors should include a dedicated background section on AI for peer review. This section should provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on AI for peer review and should clearly position the proposed approach within this context. Finally, the authors should consider expanding the scope of their work beyond machine learning papers. While the focus on ML is understandable, the peer review process is also critical in other scientific domains. Exploring the generalizability of the proposed approach to other fields would significantly enhance the impact of the work. These suggestions, if implemented, would address the identified weaknesses and significantly strengthen the paper's overall contribution.\n",

      "This paper introduces Multi-Paper Benchmarking Review (MPBR), a novel approach to scientific peer review that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the quality and efficiency of the review process. The core idea behind MPBR is to simulate a competitive environment where research papers are not evaluated in isolation but rather in the context of other related works, termed 'benchmarking papers.' This is achieved through a multi-agent system comprising reviewer agents and reviewer manager agents. Reviewer agents are responsible for generating detailed assessments of research papers, considering both the target paper and the benchmarking papers. These reviews are then aggregated and refined by reviewer manager agents, which also handle the selection of relevant benchmarking papers. The authors propose two settings for MPBR: individual review, where each paper is reviewed independently, and collective review, where scores and preferences from multiple reviews are accumulated to update the language model's capabilities. The paper presents a comprehensive benchmark dataset of 16,130 reviews for 5,445 papers, collected from top AI conferences, which serves as the foundation for their experiments. The empirical findings suggest that MPBR can produce more comprehensive and detailed reviews compared to traditional peer review, particularly when using heterogeneous benchmarking papers. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their agent system in selecting and aggregating reviews, leading to improved review quality. The paper's significance lies in its attempt to address the limitations of traditional peer review by introducing a competitive dynamic and leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to enhance the evaluation process. However, the paper also acknowledges the need for further research to address the challenges and limitations of the proposed approach, such as the potential for bias and the need for more robust evaluation metrics. The authors' work represents a significant step towards automating and improving the scientific peer review process, with the potential to accelerate scientific progress.\n",

      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. The core idea of introducing a competitive dynamic into the peer review process through multi-paper benchmarking is both novel and insightful. By conditioning reviews on related benchmarking papers, the authors have created a system that encourages more comprehensive and detailed evaluations. The use of a multi-agent system, with distinct roles for reviewer agents and reviewer manager agents, is a well-structured approach that allows for the automation of various aspects of the review process. The creation of a large-scale benchmark dataset of 16,130 reviews for 5,445 papers is a significant contribution that provides a valuable resource for future research in this area. The empirical results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of MPBR in generating higher-quality reviews compared to traditional methods, are compelling. The authors' exploration of both homogeneous and heterogeneous benchmarking papers provides valuable insights into the impact of different types of benchmarking on review quality. The use of low-cost training and inference strategies, such as LoRA, FP8 quantization, and DeepSpeed, is a practical approach that makes the system more accessible and efficient. The paper's focus on addressing the limitations of traditional peer review, such as reviewer fatigue and bias, is highly relevant and timely. The authors' efforts to formalize the multi-paper benchmarking review task and to develop a system that can automatically select and aggregate reviews are important steps towards automating the peer review process. The paper's overall contribution to the field of automated peer review is significant, and I believe that the proposed approach has the potential to accelerate scientific progress by improving the quality and efficiency of the review process.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant further discussion. First, the paper's claim that the competitive dynamic among papers leads to more original and significant research ideas lacks empirical support. While the authors state this as a finding, I found no specific experiment or metric dedicated to measuring the impact of the competitive dynamic on the originality and significance of the *review outputs* themselves, as opposed to the research ideas. The paper demonstrates that benchmarking papers improve review quality, but the direct link to fostering more original and significant *research ideas* through this competitive dynamic is not explicitly measured or deeply analyzed. This is a crucial point, as the paper's central argument relies on this connection. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as the paper does show improved review quality with benchmarking, but the link to fostering more original and significant research ideas is not directly measured. Second, the paper's methodology lacks clarity in several areas. The specific prompting strategies used to elicit originality and significance scores from the LLMs are not detailed, making it difficult to reproduce the experiments. The paper also lacks a detailed explanation of how the 'no preference' score is used in the optimization process. The criteria for selecting benchmarking papers are not clearly defined, and the paper does not discuss the potential impact of different selection strategies on the quality of the generated reviews. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed explanation of how the preference loss is calculated and used to update the language model's capabilities. This lack of methodological detail makes it difficult to assess the validity of the results and to build upon the proposed approach. My confidence in this weakness is high, as these details are indeed missing from the paper. Third, the paper's evaluation metrics are limited. The paper primarily uses originality, significance, and P-ROUGE scores, which may not fully capture the nuances of peer review quality. The paper lacks a discussion of the limitations of these metrics and does not explore alternative evaluation approaches, such as qualitative analysis of the generated reviews or user studies with human experts. The paper also does not address the potential for bias in the generated reviews and does not explore methods for mitigating this bias. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's evaluation is indeed limited to a few metrics, and the potential for bias is not addressed. Fourth, the paper's discussion of the computational cost of the proposed approach is insufficient. While the authors mention using low-cost training and inference strategies, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required to train and deploy the MPBR system. This lack of information makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed approach. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper lacks a detailed computational cost analysis. Fifth, the paper does not adequately address the potential for the system to be gamed or to generate biased reviews. The paper lacks a discussion of the ethical implications of using LLMs for peer review and does not explore methods for detecting and mitigating bias in the generated reviews. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not address the potential for bias or discuss ethical implications. Finally, the paper's claim that the system is self-sustaining is not fully supported by the evidence. While the system can select and aggregate reviews with minimal human intervention, the need for periodic updates and retraining suggests that it is not entirely self-sustaining. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as the paper does show some level of automation, but the need for updates and retraining contradicts the claim of being entirely self-sustaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should conduct experiments to isolate the effect of the competitive dynamic on the originality and significance of the generated reviews. This could involve comparing the quality of reviews generated with and without the explicit intention of benchmarking, perhaps by using a control group where the LLM is asked to review papers without any reference to other related works. This would help to isolate the effect of the competitive dynamic on the quality of the generated reviews. Furthermore, the authors should explore different methods for quantifying originality and significance, potentially incorporating metrics that are more sensitive to the nuances of research impact. Second, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the prompting strategies used to elicit originality and significance scores from the LLMs. This should include specific examples of the prompts used and a discussion of how these prompts were designed. The authors should also clarify how the 'no preference' score is used in the optimization process and how it affects the overall performance of the system. A more detailed explanation of the benchmarking paper selection process is also needed, including the criteria used to determine relevance and the potential impact of different selection strategies on the quality of the generated reviews. The authors should also provide a more detailed explanation of how the preference loss is calculated and used to update the language model's capabilities. Third, the authors should incorporate more robust evaluation metrics that go beyond simple scoring. This could include metrics that assess the logical consistency of the reviews, the depth of analysis, and the identification of potential flaws in the methodology. The authors should also explore alternative evaluation approaches, such as qualitative analysis of the generated reviews or user studies with human experts. Fourth, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed approach, including the resources required for training and deployment. This analysis should also consider the scalability of the system and its ability to handle large volumes of submissions. Fifth, the authors should address the potential for the system to be gamed or to generate biased reviews. This could involve exploring methods for detecting and mitigating bias in the generated reviews, as well as discussing the ethical implications of using LLMs for peer review. The authors should also consider the potential for adversarial attacks on the system and how these attacks could be prevented. Finally, the authors should clarify the limitations of their approach and acknowledge the need for further research to address these limitations. The authors should also discuss the potential impact of their work on the academic community and the broader society. The authors should also consider the potential for their system to be used in other domains beyond scientific peer review.\n",

      "This paper introduces AgentReview, a novel framework designed to enhance the quality of scientific peer reviews by leveraging large language models (LLMs). The core idea is to model the review process as a competitive game among multiple LLM agents, each acting as a reviewer, author, or program chair. This multi-agent approach aims to mimic the iterative and adversarial nature of real-world peer review, where reviewers critique each other's work and authors provide feedback. The framework incorporates a reward modeling mechanism to optimize review quality, drawing inspiration from reinforcement learning principles. The authors claim that AgentReview outperforms single-agent baselines, such as GPT-4o and chain-of-thought methods, in terms of review quality, alignment with human reviews, and predictive accuracy of review outcomes. The paper presents empirical evaluations on the ICLR 2024 and NeurIPS submissions, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach. The authors also highlight the connection between their framework and the scientific method, emphasizing the role of competition and critique in improving the quality of reviews. The paper's main contribution lies in its innovative application of multi-agent systems and game theory to the peer review process, offering a potential solution to the challenges of traditional review methods. The authors also emphasize the potential of their approach to accelerate scientific discovery by providing high-quality feedback to researchers. The paper's findings suggest that LLMs can be effectively used to augment and improve the peer review process, potentially leading to more efficient and rigorous scientific evaluation. The authors also plan to make their code, dataset, and related resources publicly available to facilitate further research in this area. The paper's overall significance lies in its exploration of a novel application of LLMs to a critical aspect of scientific research, offering a promising avenue for future development and improvement of the peer review process.\n",

      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. First, the paper tackles a significant and timely problem: the need to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific peer review. The authors' approach of using LLMs to simulate and enhance this process is both innovative and relevant. The multi-agent framework, where LLMs compete as reviewers, authors, and program chairs, is a novel approach that mimics the adversarial nature of real-world peer review. This competitive setting, combined with the incorporation of author feedback, allows for iterative refinement of reviews, which I believe is a key strength of the proposed method. The use of a reward modeling mechanism to optimize review quality is another notable contribution. This mechanism, inspired by reinforcement learning, provides a principled way to guide the LLMs towards generating higher-quality reviews. The empirical evaluations on the ICLR 2024 and NeurIPS submissions provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that AgentReview outperforms single-agent baselines in terms of review quality, alignment with human reviews, and predictive accuracy of review outcomes. The authors' decision to make their code, dataset, and related resources publicly available is also commendable, as it will facilitate further research and development in this area. The paper's connection to the scientific method, emphasizing the role of competition and critique, is also a valuable contribution, highlighting the theoretical underpinnings of their approach.

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a detailed explanation of the reward modeling mechanism. While the authors introduce the concept of a reviewer reward model, they do not provide specifics on its architecture, training data, or features. The paper states that the reward model is trained to predict which review is most likely to lead to a high-quality paper, but it does not explain how 'high-quality' is defined or measured. The authors also mention that they do not derive the reward model but assume its existence, which I find to be a significant limitation. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the validity of the reward model and its impact on the overall performance of AgentReview. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper explicitly states that the reward model is assumed rather than derived, and lacks specific details on its implementation. Second, the paper does not adequately address the computational cost and scalability of the proposed approach. The multi-agent competition game, with its iterative review refinement process, is likely to be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex reviews. The paper does not provide any analysis of the time and resources required to train and run the model, nor does it discuss potential strategies for reducing computational overhead. This lack of discussion raises concerns about the practical applicability of the proposed approach in real-world scenarios. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper describes a computationally intensive process but lacks any discussion of its computational cost or scalability. Third, the paper's experimental setup raises concerns about potential data leakage. The authors use the ICLR 2024 dataset, which includes papers published in the past. Since LLMs are pre-trained on vast amounts of internet data, including scientific publications, there is a risk that the LLMs might have been exposed to the content of the ICLR 2024 papers during their pre-training phase. This potential data leakage could inflate the reported performance metrics and make it difficult to generalize the findings to future conferences. The paper does not address this issue or discuss strategies to mitigate it. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper uses a dataset of published papers without addressing the potential for data leakage from the LLM's pre-training data. Fourth, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of the ethical implications of using LLMs for peer review. While the authors mention the potential for bias amplification, they do not delve into specific ethical concerns such as fairness, accountability, transparency, and the potential for misuse. The paper also does not discuss the potential for the model to be used to generate biased or unfair reviews, or the impact of such reviews on the careers of early-career researchers. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper lacks a detailed discussion of ethical implications, focusing mainly on performance metrics. Fifth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the types of errors that the model makes. While the paper presents overall performance metrics, it does not provide insights into the specific types of mistakes that the model makes, such as factual errors, logical fallacies, or biases. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to identify areas for improvement and to understand the limitations of the proposed approach. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper focuses on overall performance metrics without a detailed error analysis. Sixth, the paper does not adequately justify the choice of baselines. The authors compare AgentReview against GPT-4o and chain-of-thought methods, but they do not provide a detailed rationale for why these baselines were chosen over other relevant methods, particularly those that use LLMs for single-agent review generation. This lack of justification makes it difficult to assess the true novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper lacks a detailed justification for the chosen baselines, especially regarding single-agent LLM review generation methods. Finally, the paper does not provide sufficient details on the human evaluation process. The paper mentions that volunteers and authors rated the generated reviews, but it does not provide details on the recruitment of these volunteers, their expertise, or the specific instructions they were given. The paper also does not discuss any measures taken to ensure the reliability and consistency of the human ratings. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper lacks details on the human evaluation process, including volunteer selection and reliability measures.\n",

      "This paper introduces AIReviewer and AIResearch, two innovative agents designed to automate scientific peer review and idea generation, respectively. AIReviewer is an interactive system that engages in multi-round discussions with authors to provide detailed feedback on scientific papers, mimicking the iterative nature of traditional peer review. AIResearch, on the other hand, employs a debate-style conversation between two AI agents to generate and refine scientific ideas, which are then ranked using a trained AI4Science Reward Model. The authors present a benchmark dataset of AI-generated reviews and conduct a large-scale human study to evaluate the performance of AIReviewer, finding that its reviews are comparable in quality to those of intermediate reviewers. Furthermore, they demonstrate that AIResearch can efficiently generate novel and high-quality scientific ideas, outperforming the PACCAR benchmark in terms of generation speed and perceived quality. The core methodological approach involves leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simulate the processes of peer review and scientific brainstorming. AIReviewer iteratively refines its reviews based on author responses, while AIResearch uses a debate mechanism to explore and evaluate research ideas. The AI4Science Reward Model, trained on preference data from AIReview, is used to rank the generated ideas. The main empirical findings include the comparable performance of AIReview to intermediate human reviewers, the ability of AIResearch to generate novel and high-quality ideas, and the impact of different LLMs on the performance of both agents. The authors also explore the impact of author choice and iteration on the quality of generated ideas. Overall, this work is significant for its attempt to automate key aspects of the scientific process, potentially reducing the burden on human researchers and accelerating scientific discovery. The paper also contributes a new benchmark dataset for evaluating AI-generated reviews and provides insights into the capabilities of LLMs for scientific tasks. However, the paper also reveals some limitations, particularly in the depth of analysis and the potential for bias in the evaluation process, which I will discuss in detail in the following sections.\n",

      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. The most notable is the innovative approach to automating scientific peer review and idea generation using LLMs. The concept of AIReviewer, which engages in multi-round discussions with authors, is a significant step towards mimicking the interactive nature of traditional peer review. This iterative process, where the AI refines its feedback based on author responses, is a key strength. Similarly, the debate-style idea generation in AIResearch, where two AI agents engage in a conversation to explore and evaluate research ideas, is a novel approach that leverages the capabilities of LLMs for creative tasks. The authors' decision to create a benchmark dataset of AI-generated reviews is also a valuable contribution, as it provides a resource for future research in this area. The large-scale human study conducted to evaluate AIReview is another strength, as it provides empirical evidence for the quality of the AI-generated reviews. The study, involving over 7,000 comparisons, demonstrates that AIReview's performance is comparable to that of intermediate human reviewers. Furthermore, the paper's exploration of the impact of different LLMs on the performance of AIReview and AIResearch is a valuable contribution, as it provides insights into the capabilities of various models for scientific tasks. The finding that the performance of the LLM agent in AIResearch follows the trend: Scaling Scale > Model Version > Model Architecture > Model Brand is an interesting and useful observation. Finally, the paper's demonstration that AIResearch can generate novel and high-quality ideas at a faster rate than the PACCAR benchmark is a significant achievement. The authors show that AIResearch achieves higher scores in importance and feasibility while maintaining high novelty, which suggests that the system is not just generating ideas quickly but also generating ideas that are potentially valuable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a detailed explanation of the prompts used for AIReviewer and AIResearch. While the authors mention that the prompts are included in the appendix, the main text lacks a description of the prompt engineering process. This is a significant omission, as the design of the prompts can greatly influence the performance of LLMs. Without a clear understanding of how the prompts were designed and refined, it is difficult to assess the robustness and generalizability of the proposed methods. This lack of transparency also makes it challenging to reproduce the results or adapt the system to new tasks. Second, the paper does not adequately address the potential for bias in the evaluation process. The authors use the same set of ground-truth reviews from the ISMRL dataset for both exposure and evaluation, which could introduce bias into the human evaluations. This is because human preferences might be influenced by the format or style of the reviews, rather than their actual quality. The paper does not report inter-annotator agreement scores, which further exacerbates this issue. Without knowing the level of agreement between human evaluators, it is difficult to assess the reliability of the evaluation results. Third, the paper lacks sufficient detail regarding the training process of the AI4Science Reward Model. While the authors mention that they use DeepSpeed, F8 Quantization, and LoRA, they do not provide specific hyperparameter settings, such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the training process and assess the robustness of the results. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a clear justification for the choice of Llama3-8B as the base model for the reward model, especially since the main experiments use Qwen2.5-7B. Fourth, the paper's analysis of the experimental results is somewhat superficial. While the authors present quantitative metrics, such as ROUGE-L scores and human preference percentages, they do not provide a detailed qualitative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the AI-generated reviews and ideas. For example, the paper does not analyze the types of errors that AIReview is prone to make or the specific characteristics of the generated ideas that contribute to their novelty and feasibility. This lack of in-depth analysis limits the insights that can be gained from the experiments. Fifth, the paper does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed approach. While the authors acknowledge that the quality of the AI agents' output depends on the underlying LLMs, they do not discuss other potential limitations, such as the potential for bias in the training data or the ethical implications of using AI for peer review. The paper also does not discuss the potential for the AI agents to generate reviews or ideas that are not scientifically sound or that are potentially harmful. Sixth, the paper's presentation could be improved. The term \"accepted reviews\" is not clearly defined, and the paper lacks a detailed description of the human evaluation process. The paper also does not provide a clear explanation of the \"Iterative Improvement\" mentioned in Figure 2. Finally, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the reward model is used to rank the generated ideas. While the paper mentions that the reward model is trained on preference data from AIReview, it does not explain how the reward scores are used to select the best ideas. The paper also does not discuss the potential for the reward model to be biased or to favor certain types of ideas over others. These weaknesses, taken together, limit the overall impact of the paper and highlight areas for future improvement. My confidence in these identified weaknesses is high, as they are based on direct examination of the paper's content and are supported by multiple reviewers.\n",

      "Based on the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements for this paper. First, the authors should provide a detailed description of the prompt engineering process in the main text. This should include the specific prompts used for AIReviewer and AIResearch, as well as the rationale behind their design. The authors should also discuss how they refined the prompts and how they plan to maintain and update them as the system is used on a larger scale. This would improve the transparency and reproducibility of the research. Second, the authors should address the potential for bias in the evaluation process. This could be done by using a different set of ground-truth reviews for exposure and evaluation, or by using a more robust evaluation methodology that accounts for potential biases. The authors should also report inter-annotator agreement scores to assess the reliability of the human evaluations. Third, the authors should provide more details regarding the training process of the AI4Science Reward Model. This should include specific hyperparameter settings, as well as a clear justification for the choice of Llama3-8B as the base model. The authors should also discuss the computational resources used for training and the training time. Fourth, the authors should conduct a more in-depth analysis of the experimental results. This should include a qualitative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the AI-generated reviews and ideas, as well as an exploration of the types of errors that AIReview is prone to make. The authors should also analyze the specific characteristics of the generated ideas that contribute to their novelty and feasibility. Fifth, the authors should address the limitations of the proposed approach more thoroughly. This should include a discussion of the potential for bias in the training data, the ethical implications of using AI for peer review, and the potential for the AI agents to generate reviews or ideas that are not scientifically sound. The authors should also discuss the potential for the AI agents to be used for malicious purposes. Sixth, the authors should improve the presentation of the paper. This should include a clear definition of the term \"accepted reviews,\" a detailed description of the human evaluation process, and a clear explanation of the \"Iterative Improvement\" mentioned in Figure 2. The authors should also provide more details about the AI4Science Reward Model and how it is used to rank the generated ideas. Finally, the authors should consider expanding the scope of their experiments to include a wider range of scientific disciplines and paper types.

      "This paper introduces PEER REVIEW AS ITERATIVE REFINEMENT (PAIR), a novel framework designed to enhance the quality of scientific peer reviews using large language models (LLMs). The core idea of PAIR is to simulate the iterative nature of the review process through a two-agent system consisting of a Reviewer LLM and a Critic LLM. The Reviewer LLM generates initial reviews, which are then evaluated and refined based on feedback from the Critic LLM. This process can be repeated multiple times, allowing for iterative improvement of the review quality. The authors explore different feedback modes for the Critic, including ranking, rejection, and construction feedback, and employ reinforcement learning (RL) to train both the Reviewer and Critic agents. The Reviewer agent is trained using a combination of preference tuning and RL, leveraging a dataset of human reviews from the Computer Physics Communications (CPC) journal. The paper's main empirical finding is that the PAIR framework, particularly when using GPT-4L as the reviewer agent, can generate reviews that achieve a high level of usefulness, as measured by a composite score based on evaluation, motivation, and clarity. The authors also demonstrate that fine-tuning the LLMs on domain-specific data further enhances performance. The overall significance of this work lies in its attempt to automate and improve the peer review process, a critical component of scientific publishing, by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs and RL. This research contributes to the growing body of work exploring the use of AI in scientific workflows and offers a promising approach to addressing the challenges of traditional peer review.\n",

      "\n",
      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. First, the core idea of using an iterative refinement process with a Reviewer and Critic agent is both intuitive and innovative. It effectively leverages the capabilities of LLMs to simulate the back-and-forth nature of real-world peer review. The use of reinforcement learning to train both agents is also a significant strength, as it allows the system to learn from its mistakes and improve over time. The authors' exploration of different feedback modes for the Critic agent, and their eventual focus on construction feedback, demonstrates a thoughtful approach to optimizing the framework. Furthermore, the empirical results presented in the paper are compelling. The fact that the PAIR framework, particularly with GPT-4L, can achieve such high usefulness scores suggests that this approach has the potential to significantly improve the quality of automated reviews. The use of a real-world dataset of human reviews from the CPC journal adds to the credibility of the findings. Finally, the authors' decision to fine-tune the LLMs on domain-specific data is a practical step that enhances the relevance of their work to real-world applications. Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated, technically sound, and empirically validated approach to automating scientific peer review.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a clear and detailed explanation of the reinforcement learning process. While the authors mention using RL and provide the loss function, they do not explicitly define the state and action spaces for either the Reviewer or Critic agent. This omission makes it difficult to fully understand how the agents interact and learn within the RL framework. For instance, the paper states that the reviewer agent acts as the actor, learning to generate and refine reviews based on the critic's feedback, which serves as the critic. The process is described as a two-player zero-sum game, where the reviewer aims to maximize the usefulness of its reviews, while the critic provides feedback to guide this improvement. However, the specific mechanisms of how the critic's feedback is translated into a reward signal for the reviewer, and how the critic itself is trained, are not sufficiently detailed. This lack of clarity makes it challenging to assess the validity of the RL approach and its contribution to the overall performance of the PAIR framework. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not provide the necessary details for a complete understanding of the RL implementation. Second, the paper's evaluation methodology raises concerns about potential overfitting. The authors use a dataset from the AI Index 2023 Annual Report for evaluation, and they mention filtering the ReviewGPT dataset by setting the overall usefulness score to null and sampling every other entry. However, they do not explicitly state whether the AI Index 2023 Annual Report was part of the training data or how the evaluation data was handled to prevent overlap with the training data. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to rule out the possibility that the reported performance gains are due to overfitting to a specific dataset rather than a general improvement in review quality. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as the paper lacks explicit details on the handling of the evaluation data. Third, the paper's reliance on a single utility function in the ranking feedback mode is a potential limitation. The authors state that using a single utility function enhances the clarity of the ranking process, but they also acknowledge that this approach diminishes the improvement observed in evaluation. This suggests that the single utility function may not fully capture the multi-faceted nature of review quality, potentially leading to suboptimal learning. The paper does not explore the use of multiple utility functions or other methods for balancing different aspects of review quality, which could be a valuable avenue for future research. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper itself acknowledges the limitations of the single utility function. Fourth, the paper's use of a common words metric to determine the quality difference between two reviews is a significant weakness. The authors define a comparison score based on the number of common words between two reviews, which they use to assign positive and negative examples for training. However, this metric is highly susceptible to common phrases and may not accurately reflect the semantic content or quality of the reviews. This could lead to the model being trained on noisy or misleading data, potentially hindering its ability to generate high-quality reviews. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's description of the metric highlights its limitations. Finally, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of the ethical implications of using AI to generate peer reviews. While the authors mention the potential for bias, they do not delve into the specific ethical challenges, such as transparency, accountability, and the potential for misuse. This omission is a significant weakness, as the ethical considerations of AI in peer review are crucial and require careful attention. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not include a dedicated section or detailed discussion on the ethical implications of their work.\n",

Second, the authors should address the potential for overfitting by providing more information about the training and evaluation datasets. They should explicitly state whether the AI Index 2023 Annual Report was part of the training data and describe any measures taken to prevent overlap between the training and evaluation sets. They should also consider evaluating their framework on additional, unseen datasets to demonstrate its generalizability. Third, the authors should explore alternative methods for determining the quality difference between reviews, rather than relying solely on the common words metric. This could involve using more sophisticated semantic similarity metrics or incorporating human annotations. They should also investigate the use of multiple utility functions or other methods for balancing different aspects of review quality, such as evaluation, motivation, and clarity. Fourth, the authors should include a more thorough discussion of the ethical implications of using AI to generate peer reviews. This discussion should address issues such as transparency, accountability, the potential for bias, and the need for human oversight. They should also consider the potential for misuse of AI-generated reviews and propose safeguards to mitigate these risks. Finally, the authors should consider including a baseline comparison with a single-agent RL approach that directly optimizes for review quality, as defined by the reward function. This would help to isolate the benefits of the multi-agent approach and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the PAIR framework. These changes would significantly strengthen the paper and address the identified limitations.\n",

Could the authors elaborate on these aspects of their implementation? Second, I am interested in the authors' rationale for choosing the specific reward function used for training the Reviewer agent. The paper defines the reward function based on the usefulness of the review, but it does not explain why this particular formulation was chosen over other possible alternatives. Could the authors provide more insight into their choice of reward function? Third, I am curious about the authors' decision to use a single utility function in the ranking feedback mode.

Finally, I am curious about the authors' perspective on the limitations of using LLMs to simulate the subjective aspects of peer review. While the paper focuses on improving the usefulness of reviews, how can the PAIR framework be extended to address other important aspects of peer review, such as fairness, ethics, and the evaluation of novelty? These questions are intended to clarify key uncertainties and explore the broader implications of the authors' work.\n",

      "This paper introduces a novel framework for enhancing scientific peer review using Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors propose a system comprising two key components: the Scientific Peer Reviewer Agent (SPRA) and the Human-LLM Reviewer Agent (HLL-RA). SPRA is designed to simulate the peer review process, generating reviews based on a structured JSON configuration and a detailed prompt. HLL-RA, on the other hand, iteratively refines these simulated reviews by incorporating human feedback. This iterative process involves multiple LLMs generating reviews, human evaluators selecting the most appropriate ones, and then using these selected reviews to fine-tune the LLMs. The authors also introduce a new synthetic dataset, Syn-RS, which contains high-quality reviews rated by humans. The core of the methodology involves fine-tuning a Qwen2.5-72B-Chat model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based on the data generated by HLL-RA. The fine-tuned model is then evaluated on the RewardBench benchmark, demonstrating improved performance compared to the base model. The paper also explores the use of the fine-tuned model in simulation-based evaluations and meta-review generation tasks. The overall aim is to align LLMs with human judgment in the context of scientific peer review, thereby potentially improving the efficiency and quality of the review process. The authors present their work as an application of Langley's computational model of scientific discovery, although the connection to this model is not deeply explored. The paper's main empirical findings are centered around the performance of the fine-tuned Qwen2.5-72B-Chat model on RewardBench and other evaluation tasks, showing that the proposed approach can lead to improvements in the model's ability to generate reviews that align with human preferences. The paper also introduces the Syn-RS dataset as a resource for further research in this area. The significance of this work lies in its potential to automate and enhance the scientific peer review process, which is often time-consuming and subject to various biases. By leveraging LLMs and human feedback, the authors aim to create a system that can assist human reviewers and potentially even generate high-quality reviews independently.\n",

      "I find several aspects of this paper to be commendable. The core idea of using LLMs to simulate and enhance the scientific peer review process is both timely and relevant, given the increasing demand for efficient and high-quality review mechanisms. The introduction of the Human-LLM Reviewer Agent (HLL-RA) is a notable contribution, as it attempts to bridge the gap between purely automated review generation and the nuanced judgment of human experts. The iterative approach of HLL-RA, where human feedback is used to refine LLM-generated reviews, is a promising way to align LLMs with human preferences. The creation of the Syn-RS dataset, which contains high-quality reviews rated by humans, is another valuable contribution. This dataset can serve as a resource for future research in this area, enabling the development and evaluation of more sophisticated peer review models. The paper's experimental results, particularly the improvements observed on the RewardBench benchmark after fine-tuning the Qwen2.5-72B-Chat model, demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach. The authors also provide a clear description of their methodology, including the SPRA configuration, the HLL-RA iterative process, and the fine-tuning procedure. The use of multiple LLMs in the HLL-RA process is also a strength, as it allows the system to capture a broader range of perspectives and insights. The paper's focus on aligning LLMs with human judgment is crucial, as it acknowledges the importance of human expertise in the peer review process. The authors also provide a detailed description of the fine-tuning process, including the use of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and the specific hyperparameters used. The paper's exploration of simulation-based evaluations and meta-review generation tasks further demonstrates the versatility of the proposed approach. Overall, the paper presents a well-structured and well-executed study that makes a valuable contribution to the field of AI-assisted scientific peer review.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the human evaluators involved in the HLL-RA process. The paper mentions that five human evaluators were used, but it provides no information about their expertise, qualifications, or potential biases. This lack of transparency is concerning, as the quality and reliability of the human feedback are crucial to the success of the HLL-RA. Without knowing the background and expertise of the evaluators, it is difficult to assess the validity of the human-aligned reviews. This is a partially valid concern with high confidence, as the paper explicitly mentions the number of evaluators but provides no further details. Second, the paper does not adequately address the potential biases that may be introduced by the HLL-RA process. While the paper aims to align LLMs with human judgment, it does not discuss the possibility that the selected reviews might reflect the subjective preferences or biases of the human evaluators. The paper also fails to explore the impact of the HLL-RA process on the diversity of the generated reviews. It is possible that the iterative optimization process might lead to a convergence of reviews, reducing the variety of perspectives and insights. This is a valid concern with high confidence, as the paper describes the human feedback loop but lacks discussion on potential biases or diversity impact. Third, the paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing AI reviewer systems. While the related work section mentions several prior studies, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the proposed system differs from and improves upon these existing approaches. This lack of comparative analysis makes it difficult to assess the novelty and significance of the proposed system. This is a valid concern with high confidence, as the related work section lists relevant papers, but the paper lacks a detailed comparative analysis. Fourth, the paper does not provide sufficient details about the ASReview dataset used in the simulation-based evaluations. While the paper mentions that it is a well-known dataset for systematic review, it does not provide specific details about its composition, size, or characteristics. This lack of information makes it difficult to assess the validity and generalizability of the simulation-based results. This is a partially valid concern with high confidence, as the paper mentions the dataset but lacks detailed information. Fifth, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the fine-tuning process. While the paper describes the use of DPO and provides some hyperparameter details, it does not include an ablation study to assess the impact of different components of the fine-tuning process. It also does not explore the sensitivity of the results to different hyperparameter settings. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to understand the factors that contribute to the observed performance improvements. This is a partially valid concern with high confidence, as the paper describes the fine-tuning process but lacks ablation studies or hyperparameter sensitivity analysis. Sixth, the paper's connection to Langley's computational model of scientific discovery is not deeply explored. While the paper mentions this model, it does not provide a detailed explanation of how the proposed system aligns with or contributes to this theoretical framework. This lack of theoretical grounding weakens the paper's claim of contributing to the computational model of scientific discovery. This is a valid concern with high confidence, as the paper mentions the model but lacks a detailed explanation of the connection. Finally, the paper does not include a direct comparison of the fine-tuned model's performance against the base models on the Syn-RS dataset itself. While the paper evaluates the model on RewardBench and other tasks, it does not show how the fine-tuning process affects the model's performance on the dataset it was trained on. This is a valid concern with high confidence, as the paper evaluates on other benchmarks but lacks a direct comparison on the Syn-RS dataset itself.\n",

This would demonstrate the versatility of their approach and its potential to address a broader range of challenges in scientific peer review.

      "This paper introduces MARP, a novel multi-agent framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate the traditional peer review process. The core idea is to have multiple LLM agents, each adopting a specific role (e.g., statistician, domain expert, methodologist), independently review an academic paper, provide feedback to one another, and iteratively refine their assessments. This process aims to mimic the diverse perspectives and iterative nature of human peer review. The authors also incorporate an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm, which fine-tunes a reward model based on the quality of the reviews, to enhance the accuracy of the final consensus conclusion. The experimental results, conducted on a dataset of NeurIPS papers, demonstrate that MARP outperforms single LLM baselines in predicting paper acceptance, suggesting the potential of this approach to assist and improve the peer review process. The authors present both qualitative examples of the generated reviews and quantitative results, including ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of the framework. The paper's main contribution lies in the novel application of a multi-agent system to the task of automated peer review, offering a potentially more robust and nuanced approach than previous methods that rely on single LLM agents. The iterative feedback mechanism and the use of a reward model further distinguish MARP from existing approaches. The authors argue that MARP can help address some of the limitations of the current peer review system, such as human bias and inefficiency, by providing a more objective and scalable alternative. However, the paper also acknowledges that the technology is not yet at a stage where it can fully replace human reviewers, but rather serve as a valuable tool to assist them. The overall significance of this work lies in its potential to revolutionize the way academic papers are reviewed, making the process more efficient, fair, and transparent. By demonstrating the feasibility of using LLMs to simulate peer review, the paper opens up new avenues for research in this area and provides a valuable contribution to the growing field of AI-assisted academic workflows.\n",

      "I find the core idea of using a multi-agent system to simulate the peer review process to be a significant strength of this paper. The approach of having multiple LLM agents, each with a specific role, independently review a paper and then provide feedback to one another is a novel and promising way to mimic the diverse perspectives and iterative nature of human peer review. This is a clear improvement over previous methods that rely on single LLM agents, as it allows for a more nuanced and comprehensive evaluation of the paper. The incorporation of an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm to fine-tune a reward model based on the quality of the reviews is another notable strength. This mechanism allows the system to learn what constitutes a good review and to iteratively improve the quality of the generated reviews. The experimental results, which demonstrate that MARP outperforms single LLM baselines in predicting paper acceptance, provide empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The ablation studies further strengthen the paper by analyzing the impact of different components of the framework, such as the number of agents and the number of iterations. The qualitative examples of the generated reviews also demonstrate the potential of MARP to produce insightful and detailed feedback. The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, which makes it accessible to a broad audience. The authors clearly articulate the problem they are addressing, the proposed solution, and the experimental results. The use of figures and tables also helps to visualize the proposed method and the experimental results. Overall, I believe that the paper makes a valuable contribution to the field of AI-assisted peer review by introducing a novel and effective multi-agent framework.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "While I appreciate the novelty of the proposed multi-agent framework, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant further discussion. Firstly, the paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with existing single-agent methods. While the authors do compare MARP against ChatGPT-3.5, this is not sufficient to fully contextualize the performance of their approach. The paper mentions other single-agent methods in the related work section, such as those using role-based interactions, but these are not included as baselines in the experimental evaluation. This omission makes it difficult to assess the true advantage of the multi-agent approach over other existing methods. The absence of a detailed comparison with these methods weakens the paper's claim of novelty and effectiveness. Secondly, the paper's evaluation is limited to a single dataset of NeurIPS papers. While this dataset is relevant to the task of peer review, it is not sufficient to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method. The paper does not discuss the potential for applying MARP to other domains or types of academic papers. This lack of evaluation on diverse datasets raises concerns about the robustness of the approach and its ability to perform well in different contexts. Furthermore, the paper does not adequately address the potential for bias in the LLMs used for the review process. While the authors acknowledge that human biases are a limitation of the current peer review system, they do not discuss the possibility that LLMs might also exhibit biases. The paper does not describe any measures taken to mitigate bias in the LLMs or to ensure fairness in the review process. This is a significant concern, as biased reviews could undermine the credibility of the proposed method. The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method. The multi-agent framework, with its iterative feedback mechanism, is likely to be computationally expensive. The paper does not provide any information about the computational resources required to run MARP or the time it takes to generate a review. This lack of information makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed method. Additionally, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the reward model is used to generate the final consensus conclusion. While the paper describes two methods for aggregating the final reviews, it does not explain how the reward model influences this process. The connection between the reward model and the consensus conclusion is not clear, which makes it difficult to understand how the system ensures the quality of the final output. Finally, the paper does not adequately address the limitations of using LLMs to simulate human peer review. While the authors acknowledge that LLMs are not yet capable of fully replacing human reviewers, they do not fully explore the potential for LLMs to miss subtle cues or implicit assumptions that human reviewers might pick up on. The paper does not discuss the potential for LLMs to make errors in judgment or to overlook important aspects of a paper. This lack of discussion about the limitations of the approach weakens the paper's overall credibility. I have a high confidence in these limitations, as they are directly observable from the paper's content and have a substantial impact on the conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. Firstly, the authors should include a more comprehensive comparison with existing single-agent methods in their experimental evaluation. This would involve implementing and evaluating several state-of-the-art single-agent baselines, such as those using role-based interactions, and comparing their performance against MARP on the same dataset. This would provide a more robust assessment of the advantages of the multi-agent approach. Secondly, the authors should evaluate their method on a more diverse set of datasets. This would involve testing MARP on papers from different domains and with different characteristics. This would help to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method and its ability to perform well in different contexts. Thirdly, the authors should address the potential for bias in the LLMs used for the review process. This could involve using techniques to mitigate bias in the LLMs or incorporating mechanisms to detect and correct biased reviews. The authors should also discuss the ethical implications of using LLMs for peer review and the potential for bias to undermine the fairness of the process. Fourthly, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method. This would involve reporting the computational resources required to run MARP, the time it takes to generate a review, and the scalability of the approach. This information is crucial for assessing the practical feasibility of the proposed method. Fifthly, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of how the reward model is used to generate the final consensus conclusion. This would involve describing the connection between the reward model and the aggregation of the final reviews, and explaining how the system ensures the quality of the final output. The authors should also provide more details about the training process of the reward model, including the specific loss function used and the hyperparameter tuning process. Finally, the authors should provide a more thorough discussion of the limitations of using LLMs to simulate human peer review. This would involve acknowledging the potential for LLMs to miss subtle cues or implicit assumptions, to make errors in judgment, or to overlook important aspects of a paper. The authors should also discuss the potential for LLMs to generate reviews that are superficial or lack the depth of human insight. This discussion should be grounded in specific examples from the experiments, highlighting instances where MARP either succeeded or failed in a manner that is directly comparable to human reviewer behavior. These suggestions are directly connected to the identified weaknesses and are aimed at improving the robustness, generalizability, and credibility of the proposed method.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for further understanding and improving the proposed method. Firstly, how does the performance of MARP vary when using different LLMs for the agent roles? The paper mentions using different LLMs, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of how the choice of LLM affects the performance of the system. Understanding this would be crucial for optimizing the system's performance. Secondly, what is the impact of the specific prompts used for each agent role on the quality of the generated reviews? The paper does not provide the specific prompts used, and it is likely that the quality of the prompts has a significant impact on the performance of the system. A sensitivity analysis of the prompts would be valuable. Thirdly, how does the system handle situations where the agents disagree on the quality of a paper? The paper mentions that the system aggregates the final reviews to form a consensus conclusion, but it does not explain how the system resolves disagreements among the agents. Understanding this would be crucial for assessing the robustness of the system. Fourthly, how does the system ensure that the generated reviews are original and not simply reproductions of existing content from the internet? The paper does not address the potential for the LLMs to generate reviews that are not original, which is a significant concern. Fifthly, what is the optimal number of agents and iterations for achieving the best performance? The paper mentions that three agents and three iterations yielded the highest accuracy, but it does not provide a detailed analysis of how these parameters affect the performance of the system. A more thorough analysis of these parameters would be valuable. Finally, how can the system be improved to better capture the subtle cues and implicit assumptions that human reviewers might pick up on? The paper acknowledges that LLMs are not yet capable of fully replacing human reviewers, but it does not provide specific suggestions for how to bridge this gap. Addressing this question would be crucial for advancing the field of AI-assisted peer review. These questions target core methodological choices and seek clarification of critical assumptions, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of the proposed method and its limitations.\n",

      "This paper introduces RALS (Referees in AI for Scientific Peer Review), a novel system designed to automate the scientific peer review process using Large Language Models (LLMs). The core idea is to leverage LLMs to generate comprehensive reviews, encompassing tasks such as reading, analyzing, and criticizing research papers, followed by an iterative self-refinement process. The authors propose a four-stage pipeline: first, the LLM reads and summarizes the paper; second, it analyzes the paper's contributions, strengths, and weaknesses; third, it launches detailed criticisms; and finally, it refines the review through self-critique. This iterative self-refinement process is a key aspect of the approach, allowing the LLM to act as both reviewer and critic, thereby enhancing the quality and depth of the generated reviews. The authors evaluated RALS using a dataset of 169 reviewed AI/ML papers from top conferences like NeurIPS, ICML, and ACL. They employed three different LLMs—GPT-4, Qwen2.5-72B, and Mistral—to generate reviews and compared them against human reviews through human evaluation. The results indicate that GPT-4 generated reviews are often preferred over human reviews by both domain experts and the general public, suggesting the potential of RALS to complement or even automate aspects of the peer review process. Furthermore, the paper explores the use of RALS as a reward model, demonstrating its ability to infer review scores from review texts. The authors also conducted ablation studies to assess the contribution of each component of the pipeline, highlighting the importance of the iterative self-refinement process. Overall, the paper presents a significant step towards automating scientific peer review, with potential implications for research quality control, discovery, and the research paradigm. However, the authors also acknowledge the limitations of their approach, particularly in terms of the generalizability of the system to other domains and the potential for bias in the generated reviews. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for further research to address these limitations and to explore the broader implications of using LLMs in scientific peer review.\n",

      "\n",
      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. First, the core idea of using LLMs to automate the scientific peer review process is both novel and highly relevant. The authors have identified a critical bottleneck in the scientific publishing ecosystem and have proposed a creative solution that leverages the capabilities of LLMs. The proposed RALS system, with its four-stage pipeline and iterative self-refinement process, is a well-structured approach to this complex problem. The iterative self-refinement process, where the LLM acts as both reviewer and critic, is a particularly innovative aspect of the work. This approach allows the LLM to generate more comprehensive and insightful reviews by iteratively improving the quality of the generated text. The experimental evaluation of RALS is another strength of the paper. The authors have conducted a thorough evaluation using a dataset of 169 reviewed AI/ML papers from top conferences. They have used three different LLMs to generate reviews and have compared them against human reviews through human evaluation. The results, which show that GPT-4 generated reviews are often preferred over human reviews, are compelling and suggest the potential of RALS to complement or even automate aspects of the peer review process. Furthermore, the authors have explored the use of RALS as a reward model, demonstrating its ability to infer review scores from review texts. This is a significant finding that highlights the versatility of the proposed approach. The ablation studies, which assess the contribution of each component of the pipeline, are also well-designed and provide valuable insights into the importance of the iterative self-refinement process. Finally, the authors have acknowledged the limitations of their approach and have proposed several avenues for future research. This demonstrates a commitment to responsible research practices and a recognition of the challenges involved in automating scientific peer review.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper's reliance on a single dataset of AI/ML papers from top conferences raises concerns about the generalizability of the RALS system. The authors explicitly state that they used the NeurIPS Review Dataset, which contains papers from NeurIPS, ICML, and ACL (Section 4.1). This narrow focus limits the system's ability to handle the diverse methodologies, evaluation metrics, and writing styles found in other scientific disciplines. As the authors themselves acknowledge in the \"Limitations and Future Directions\" section (Section 6.3), the performance of RALS on papers from other domains is unknown. This is a critical limitation because the language and structure of a review in, say, experimental physics or social sciences, can differ significantly from those in AI/ML. The system's effectiveness may be severely limited when applied to fields with different conventions, and this lack of generalizability undermines the claim of broad applicability. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is directly supported by the paper's description of the dataset and the authors' own acknowledgments. Second, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the types of errors or biases that the system might introduce. While the authors mention the potential for bias in human reviews (Introduction), they do not provide a concrete analysis of how RALS might perpetuate or amplify existing biases in scientific evaluation. The absence of such an analysis is a significant oversight, as it is crucial to understand the potential for the system to inadvertently favor certain methodologies, perspectives, or even institutions. The paper does not include any experiments specifically designed to identify and mitigate these biases. This is a critical limitation, as it could lead to unfair or inaccurate evaluations. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is based on the absence of any discussion or experiments related to bias analysis. Third, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required by RALS. The authors mention using GPT-4, Qwen2.5-72B, and Mistral (Section 4.2), but they do not discuss the computational cost associated with running these models, nor do they compare it to the resources required for human review. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the system, especially for large-scale applications. The computational cost of running large language models can be substantial, and the paper needs to address this aspect in more detail. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is based on the absence of any discussion or experiments related to computational resource analysis. Fourth, the paper's evaluation metrics, while including human evaluation, could be more comprehensive. The authors use metrics such as preference over human reviews, helpfulness, correctness, relevance, and review length (Section 4.3). However, they do not include metrics that assess the novelty or creativity of the reviews, which are important aspects of a good review. The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the correlation between the automated metrics and human judgments of review quality. This is a limitation because it is not clear how well the chosen metrics capture the full spectrum of what constitutes a good review. My confidence in this limitation is medium, as the paper does include human evaluation, but lacks more nuanced metrics. Fifth, the paper does not include a comparison with other existing automated review systems or LLM-based review generation methods. The authors compare RALS against human reviews and some ablations (Section 4.4), but they do not benchmark their system against other state-of-the-art approaches. This lack of comparison makes it difficult to assess the relative performance of RALS and to determine its advantages and disadvantages compared to other methods. This is a critical limitation, as it is essential to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over existing alternatives. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is based on the absence of any comparison with other automated review systems. Finally, the paper lacks sufficient detail regarding the human evaluation process. While the authors mention using a survey adapted from a NeurIPS publication (Section 4.3), they do not provide the specific survey questions or detailed procedures. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the validity of the human evaluation results. My confidence in this limitation is high, as it is based on the absence of specific survey questions and detailed procedures.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should significantly expand the evaluation of RALS to include datasets from diverse scientific disciplines. This would involve curating or generating datasets of reviewed papers from fields such as experimental physics, biology, and social sciences. The evaluation should not only focus on the overall preference of reviews but also on the system's ability to identify key methodological strengths and weaknesses, which can vary significantly across disciplines. For example, in experimental physics, the focus might be on the precision and accuracy of measurements, while in social sciences, the emphasis might be on the validity of the research design and the interpretation of qualitative data. A detailed analysis of how RALS performs in these different contexts would provide a more comprehensive understanding of its capabilities and limitations. Second, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of the types of errors and biases that the system might introduce. This would involve examining the system's reviews for instances where it might misinterpret methodological choices, overemphasize certain aspects of the paper while neglecting others, or exhibit biases towards specific topics or approaches. The authors should also explore the system's ability to handle nuanced arguments and subtle critiques, which are often crucial in scientific reviews. This analysis should include specific examples of both successful and unsuccessful reviews generated by RALS, highlighting the factors that contributed to these outcomes. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the potential for the system to perpetuate existing biases in scientific evaluation, such as biases towards certain methodologies, perspectives, or even institutions. This could involve comparing the system's reviews with human reviews and analyzing any discrepancies in terms of the aspects of the paper that are emphasized or downplayed. Third, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required by RALS. This should include an assessment of the time and resources needed to generate a review, as well as a comparison with the resources required for human review. The authors should also explore the scalability of the system and its ability to handle large volumes of review requests. This analysis should consider the practical implications of deploying RALS in real-world scenarios and identify any potential bottlenecks or limitations. Fourth, the authors should incorporate more comprehensive evaluation metrics that assess the novelty and creativity of the reviews. This could involve using metrics that measure the diversity of the generated text or the introduction of new perspectives. The authors should also conduct a more detailed analysis of the correlation between the automated metrics and human judgments of review quality. This would involve comparing the system's reviews with human reviews and analyzing the aspects of the paper that are emphasized or downplayed. Fifth, the authors should benchmark RALS against other existing automated review systems or LLM-based review generation methods. This would involve comparing the performance of RALS with other state-of-the-art approaches using the same evaluation metrics. This comparison would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the relative strengths and weaknesses of RALS. Finally, the authors should provide more details regarding the human evaluation process. This should include the specific survey questions used, the instructions given to the evaluators, and the procedures used to ensure the quality of the human evaluation. This would enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the results.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have several questions that arise from my analysis of this paper. First, given the potential for bias in the training data, how can the authors ensure that RALS does not perpetuate or amplify existing biases in scientific evaluation? This is a critical concern, as it could lead to unfair or inaccurate evaluations. Second, how does RALS handle the subjective nature of some review aspects, such as the perceived significance or novelty of a contribution? While the authors mention that the survey included questions about helpfulness, readability, and trustworthiness (Section 4.3), it is not clear how these subjective aspects are addressed in the evaluation. Third, what are the specific limitations of the self-refinement process, and how can these limitations be addressed? The paper mentions that the self-refinement process can sometimes lead to reviews becoming overly positive (Section 6.3), but it does not provide a detailed analysis of the mechanisms that contribute to this phenomenon. Fourth, how does the performance of RALS vary across different types of papers, such as theoretical vs. empirical studies, or papers with different levels of complexity? The paper's evaluation is limited to AI/ML papers, and it is not clear how the system would perform on papers with different characteristics. Fifth, what are the ethical implications of using LLMs to automate scientific peer review, and how can these implications be addressed? This is a critical question, as the use of LLMs in this context could have significant societal impacts. Finally, what are the specific steps that the authors plan to take to address the limitations of their approach and to explore the broader implications of using LLMs in scientific peer review? The paper mentions several avenues for future research, but it would be helpful to have a more detailed roadmap for future work.\n",

      "This paper introduces the AI Reviewer Agent (AIRA), a system designed to automate the generation of scientific peer reviews using large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a multi-agent architecture, where different agents are responsible for reading the paper, taking notes, summarizing feedback, and generating the final review. To evaluate the performance of AIRA, they also introduce the AI Review Assessment (AIRA) benchmark, a multiple-choice questionnaire designed to assess various aspects of review quality. The authors conduct experiments using the ICML 2024 conference dataset, comparing AI-generated reviews with human reviews. Their findings suggest that AIRA can generate reviews that are perceived as comparable to human-written reviews, particularly when aligned with advanced models and collaborative prompting strategies. However, the study also reveals that human reviewers are still preferred in domains outside of AI. The authors contribute a comprehensive dataset of over 640 reviews generated by both humans and AI, aiming to facilitate further research in this area. The core contribution of this work lies in the development of an AI-powered system for automating the peer review process and the introduction of a benchmark for evaluating the quality of these AI-generated reviews. The authors explore the potential of LLMs to assist in the review process, while also acknowledging the limitations and challenges of this approach. The paper's significance lies in its attempt to address the growing need for efficient and effective peer review processes in the face of increasing research output. However, the paper's reliance on a single dataset and the lack of detailed analysis of the AI system's performance raise questions about the generalizability and robustness of the findings. The authors also acknowledge the potential for AI reviewers to game the evaluation process, which is a critical ethical consideration. Overall, this paper presents a valuable initial step towards automating the peer review process, but it also highlights the need for further research and development in this area.\n",

      "I find several aspects of this paper to be commendable. The authors tackle a significant and timely problem: the need for efficient and effective peer review processes in scientific publishing. The development of AIRA, a system designed to automate the generation of peer reviews, is a novel and ambitious undertaking. The multi-agent architecture, while not fully detailed, presents an interesting approach to structuring the review generation process. The introduction of the AI Review Assessment (AIRA) benchmark is another notable contribution. This multiple-choice questionnaire provides a structured way to evaluate the quality of reviews, and the authors' efforts to validate this benchmark through a large-scale human evaluation are commendable. The collection of a comprehensive dataset of over 640 reviews, including both human and AI-generated reviews, is a valuable resource for the research community. This dataset will undoubtedly facilitate further research in this area and contribute to the development of more robust AI reviewer agents. The authors' exploration of transfer learning and multi-agent collaboration techniques to align LLMs with the AI academic community is also a positive aspect of this work. The experimental results, while not without limitations, demonstrate the potential of LLMs to generate reviews that are perceived as comparable to human-written reviews, particularly in the AI domain. The authors' acknowledgment of the limitations of their approach, such as the potential for AI reviewers to game the evaluation process, is also a strength, as it demonstrates a responsible and ethical approach to research. Finally, the authors' commitment to making their dataset publicly available will further enhance the impact of their work and promote collaboration within the research community.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several significant weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper suffers from a lack of clarity and organization, particularly in the presentation of its methodology and experimental setup. The introduction of two entities with the same acronym, AIRA, is confusing and makes it difficult to distinguish between the AI Reviewer Agent system and the AI Review Assessment benchmark. This lack of clarity extends to the description of the AIRA system itself. While the authors describe a multi-agent architecture, the specific roles and interactions of these agents are not clearly defined. The paper lacks detailed prompt templates for each agent, making it difficult to understand how the system is implemented and how its performance can be replicated. The experimental setup is also not clearly articulated. The authors do not provide sufficient details on how the human reviewers were selected, what instructions they were given, and how their reviews were collected. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the validity of the human review baseline. Furthermore, the paper's reliance on a single dataset from ICML 2024 raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings. The authors do not provide any evidence to support the claim that their benchmark is generalizable to other academic domains or conferences. The evaluation methodology also presents a significant weakness. The use of a multiple-choice questionnaire to assess review quality is overly simplistic and fails to capture the nuances of effective peer review. The authors do not provide a detailed justification for the design of their questionnaire, nor do they compare it to other evaluation methods. The paper also lacks a thorough analysis of the AI system's performance. While the authors present results comparing AI-generated and human reviews, they do not delve into the specific strengths and weaknesses of the AI system. There is no detailed error analysis, no discussion of the types of errors the AI system makes, and no comparison of the AI-generated reviews with human reviews on a case-by-case basis. This lack of in-depth analysis makes it difficult to understand the limitations of the AI system and identify areas for improvement. The paper also lacks a clear articulation of its research focus. It is unclear whether the primary contribution is the development of the AIRA system, the introduction of the AIRA benchmark, or an empirical study of LLMs as reviewers. This lack of focus makes it difficult to assess the paper's overall contribution. Finally, the paper's discussion of the potential for AI reviewers to game the evaluation process is not adequately addressed. While the authors acknowledge this risk, they do not provide any concrete solutions or mitigation strategies. The paper also lacks a discussion of other ethical considerations, such as the potential for bias in AI-generated reviews. These weaknesses, taken together, significantly undermine the paper's claims and limit its overall impact. I have a high level of confidence in these identified weaknesses, as they are directly supported by my analysis of the paper's content and structure.\n",

      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should clearly distinguish between the AIRA system and the AIRA benchmark throughout the paper.

      "This paper introduces a novel framework for AI-assisted peer review, proposing three distinct systems: AIReviewer, AIReviewerStar, and AIReviewerPlus. The core idea is to leverage large language models (LLMs) to simulate and enhance the traditional peer review process. AIReviewer serves as the foundational model, trained using historical review data and employing a reasoning module to generate latent decisions, which are then transformed into structured reviews by an execution module. AIReviewerStar builds upon this by incorporating direct preference optimization (DPO), aiming to align the generated reviews more closely with human expert reviews. Finally, AIReviewerPlus further refines the process by integrating author feedback to iteratively improve review quality. The authors evaluate these systems through a series of experiments, including paper state encoding, review criteria encoding, review generation, and review quality evaluation. They use the NEURIPS 2023 dataset for training and testing, comparing their models against several baselines, including GPT-4 and other LLMs. The results suggest that the proposed AIReviewer systems can generate detailed and consistent reviews, with AIReviewerStar outperforming existing LLM-based review systems and AIReviewerPlus accelerating the feedback loop between authors and reviewers. The paper also introduces a collaborative platform, 'https://reviewerplus.io', to facilitate the practical application of their work. Overall, the paper presents a promising approach to automating and improving the peer review process, although several limitations need to be addressed to ensure its robustness and reliability.\n",

      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly compelling. First, the paper tackles a significant and timely problem: the need to improve the efficiency and quality of the scientific peer review process. The authors' approach of using LLMs to simulate and enhance this process is both innovative and practical. The proposed AIReviewer framework, with its three distinct systems, demonstrates a clear progression of ideas, starting with a basic model and incrementally adding features to improve performance. The use of historical review data to train AIReviewer is a logical approach, and the incorporation of DPO in AIReviewerStar and author feedback in AIReviewerPlus are well-motivated. The experimental results, while not without limitations, show that the proposed systems can generate detailed and consistent reviews, and that AIReviewerStar and AIReviewerPlus offer improvements over existing LLM-based systems. The paper also makes a valuable contribution by providing a dataset and benchmark for future research in this area. The inclusion of a collaborative platform, 'https://reviewerplus.io', further highlights the practical relevance of this work and its potential for real-world application. The authors' focus on optimizing review quality through reward and feedback mechanisms is a significant step towards creating more reliable and efficient peer review systems. Finally, the paper's exploration of different evaluation metrics, including both quantitative and qualitative measures, demonstrates a commitment to thorough and rigorous evaluation.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks sufficient detail regarding the training process of AIReviewer. While the authors mention using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and LoRA for training, they do not specify the LLM backbone used, the exact hyperparameters, or the training time. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and assess the robustness of the model. Furthermore, the paper does not include a direct comparison of the training cost of AIReviewer with other models, which is a critical factor in evaluating its practicality. The absence of a discussion on the computational resources required for training, such as GPU memory usage and training time per epoch, further limits the transparency of the training process. My confidence in this issue is high, as the missing details are fundamental for reproducibility and practical application. Second, the paper's evaluation methodology raises concerns about potential overfitting. The authors use the NEURIPS 2023 dataset for both training and testing, with a random split of 3:1:1. This approach does not guarantee that the test set represents unseen data, and the high accuracy scores on the test set raise suspicion that the model may have memorized the training data. The lack of cross-validation or other techniques to ensure the generalizability of the results further exacerbates this concern. My confidence in this issue is also high, as the use of the same dataset for training and testing without proper separation is a well-known cause of overfitting. Third, the paper's evaluation of review quality relies heavily on LLM-based metrics, which are not always reliable. While the authors use GPT-4 and Qwen2.5-110B to evaluate the quality of generated reviews, they do not include a human evaluation study to validate these results. This lack of human assessment makes it difficult to determine the true quality of the generated reviews, especially in terms of constructiveness and thoroughness. The absence of human evaluation is a significant limitation, as LLM-based evaluations may not fully capture the nuances of human judgment. My confidence in this issue is high, as human evaluation is a crucial component of assessing the quality of peer reviews. Fourth, the paper's explanation of the 'order-n reasoning' module is vague and lacks technical depth. The authors describe it as analyzing inputs and producing a latent decision, but they do not provide a detailed explanation of how this module functions, its architecture, or its training process. The lack of a concrete example or a more detailed explanation makes it difficult to understand the module's contribution to the overall system. My confidence in this issue is high, as the lack of clarity hinders the understanding of a core component of the proposed system. Fifth, the paper does not adequately address the potential for bias in the generated reviews. While the authors acknowledge this risk in the limitations section, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the types of biases that might be present in the training data or how these biases might manifest in the generated reviews. The absence of a discussion on mitigation strategies further limits the paper's ability to address this critical concern. My confidence in this issue is high, as bias in training data is a well-known problem that can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes. Finally, the paper lacks sufficient detail regarding the collaborative platform, 'https://reviewerplus.io'. The authors mention deploying AIReviewerStar on this platform, but they do not provide details about its architecture, user interface, or how it integrates with existing submission systems. This lack of information makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed system. My confidence in this issue is high, as the lack of details limits the understanding of the practical application of the proposed system.\n",

      "This paper introduces SimPEER, a novel dataset of 2,000 simulated peer reviews based on machine learning papers from NeurIPS and ICLR conferences. The authors employ a multi-agent simulation approach, using GPT-4o to generate both single-agent and multi-turn review interactions. The core idea is to leverage these simulations to train a specialized automated reviewer agent, named ARA, which is based on the Mistral-7B model. The training process involves two stages: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the generated SimPEER dataset, followed by preference optimization (PO) using human preferences. The resulting model, ARA-PO, is evaluated against commercial large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5. The authors demonstrate that ARA-PO generates higher-quality reviews, as assessed by human annotators, and shows competitive performance in predicting paper acceptance decisions. The paper's primary contribution lies in the creation of the SimPEER dataset and the demonstration of a two-stage training approach for optimizing a reviewer agent. The authors emphasize the potential of their work to enhance the efficiency and quality of the peer review process, particularly in the field of machine learning. However, the paper also acknowledges the limitations of simulated data and the need for further research to address potential biases and ethical concerns. The methodology involves using GPT-4o to simulate reviewer interactions, which are then used to fine-tune the ARA model. The preference optimization stage incorporates human feedback to further refine the model's performance. The evaluation includes both human assessments of review quality and comparisons of acceptance decision predictions. The paper's findings suggest that the proposed approach can effectively leverage simulated data to train a competitive reviewer agent, but also highlights the challenges and limitations of this approach. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of automated peer review, but also raises important questions about the reliability and generalizability of the proposed methods.\n",

      "The paper's primary strength lies in the introduction of the SimPEER dataset, a valuable resource for researchers interested in automated peer review. The dataset, comprising 2,000 simulated reviews based on real machine learning papers, provides a foundation for training and evaluating reviewer agents. The authors' approach of using multi-agent simulations to generate this data is a notable contribution, as it attempts to capture the interactive nature of real-world peer review. Furthermore, the paper's two-stage training methodology, involving supervised fine-tuning followed by preference optimization, is a well-structured approach that leverages both the simulated data and human preferences. The empirical results, demonstrating that the ARA-PO model outperforms commercial LLMs in generating high-quality reviews, are compelling. The human evaluation of review quality, which shows that ARA-PO receives higher scores than GPT-4o and Qwen2.5, provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper also demonstrates the model's ability to predict paper acceptance decisions, further highlighting its potential utility. The authors' clear presentation of the methodology and experimental setup facilitates understanding and reproducibility. The inclusion of both human evaluations and quantitative metrics provides a comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. The paper's focus on a critical aspect of scientific progress, the peer review process, is also a significant strength. By addressing the challenges of automating this process, the authors contribute to a timely and important area of research. The use of a multi-agent simulation approach, which attempts to model the interactive nature of peer review, is a novel contribution that distinguishes this work from previous efforts. The paper's emphasis on using human preferences to refine the model's performance is also a positive aspect, as it acknowledges the importance of human judgment in the peer review process. The authors' clear articulation of the paper's contributions and limitations also enhances its overall quality. Finally, the paper's focus on a practical application of large language models, specifically in the context of peer review, makes it a relevant and impactful contribution to the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, several weaknesses warrant careful consideration. A primary concern is the heavy reliance on simulated data for training the reviewer agent. As the reviewers have pointed out, the use of GPT-4o to generate the SimPEER dataset introduces the potential for biases and inaccuracies to propagate into the trained model. The paper acknowledges this limitation, but the extent to which these biases affect the model's performance is not fully explored. The lack of experiments comparing the performance of ARA-PO when trained on simulated versus real-world peer review data makes it difficult to assess the true value of the proposed approach. This is a critical omission, as it leaves open the question of whether the model's performance is due to its ability to learn from real peer review interactions or simply from mimicking the style of the simulated data. The paper's evaluation methodology also presents some weaknesses. The human evaluation of review quality, while providing valuable insights, is based on researchers and students from top ML labs, not actual program committee (PC) members. This raises concerns about the external validity of the results, as these annotators may not have the same level of experience or perspective as actual PC members. The paper does not provide any justification for why these annotators were chosen over PC members, nor does it analyze the potential impact of this choice on the evaluation results. Furthermore, the paper's approach of comparing LLM-generated reviews with human annotations, rather than directly comparing the LLM's output to actual human reviews, limits the ability to assess the model's performance in a real-world context. The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the human preference data used for preference optimization. The process by which human annotators indicated their preferences between pairs of reviews is not described in sufficient detail, and the paper does not provide any information about the inter-annotator agreement. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to assess the reliability of the human preference data and its impact on the model's performance. The paper's claim that the proposed method can accelerate the scientific discovery process is not supported by any empirical evidence. While the paper demonstrates the model's ability to generate high-quality reviews and predict acceptance decisions, it does not provide any evidence that using the model would actually lead to faster scientific progress. This claim is purely speculative and should be removed or supported with further evidence. The paper also does not adequately address the potential for the model to be used for unethical purposes, such as generating fake reviews or manipulating the peer review process. While the paper mentions ethical considerations in the limitations section, it does not provide a detailed discussion of these risks or propose any mitigation strategies. The paper's reliance on the Bayesopt leaderboard for evaluating acceptance decision prediction is also problematic. The paper does not provide a justification for why this specific leaderboard was chosen, nor does it address the potential biases associated with it. The use of a different dataset and metric from those used in the work that developed the leaderboard further complicates the interpretation of the results. Finally, the paper's lack of a dedicated background section on AI for peer review makes it difficult for readers unfamiliar with this area to fully appreciate the context and significance of the work. The paper jumps directly into the methodology without providing a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on AI for peer review. These weaknesses, taken together, raise significant concerns about the reliability, generalizability, and practical implications of the proposed approach. The lack of comparison with real-world data, the limitations of the evaluation methodology, and the absence of a thorough analysis of the human preference data all contribute to these concerns. The speculative claims about accelerating scientific discovery and the lack of discussion about potential ethical risks further weaken the paper's overall impact.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First and foremost, the authors should conduct experiments comparing the performance of ARA-PO when trained on real-world peer review data versus simulated data. This would provide crucial insights into the value of the proposed simulation approach and help to quantify the impact of potential biases in the simulated data. If real-world data is not readily available, the authors should explore methods for mitigating the biases in the simulated data, such as using diverse prompts or incorporating human feedback during the simulation process. Second, the authors should conduct a more rigorous evaluation of the model's performance using actual program committee (PC) members as annotators. This would provide a more realistic assessment of the model's ability to generate high-quality reviews and would address the concerns about the external validity of the current evaluation. If it is not possible to recruit PC members, the authors should at least provide a detailed analysis of the potential impact of using non-PC members as annotators. This analysis should include a comparison of the ratings provided by the two groups, if possible, and a discussion of the potential biases introduced by using non-PC members. Third, the authors should provide a more detailed description of the human preference data collection process. This should include information about the instructions given to the annotators, the specific criteria they used to indicate their preferences, and the inter-annotator agreement. This would help to assess the reliability of the human preference data and its impact on the model's performance. Fourth, the authors should remove the speculative claim about accelerating scientific discovery or provide empirical evidence to support it. This could involve conducting experiments to measure the time taken to complete the peer review process with and without the use of the proposed model. Fifth, the authors should include a more detailed discussion of the potential ethical risks associated with the proposed approach. This discussion should include specific examples of how the model could be used for unethical purposes and propose mitigation strategies to address these risks. Sixth, the authors should provide a justification for the use of the Bayesopt leaderboard for evaluating acceptance decision prediction and address the potential biases associated with it. This could involve comparing the results obtained using the Bayesopt leaderboard with those obtained using other metrics or datasets. Seventh, the authors should include a dedicated background section on AI for peer review. This section should provide a comprehensive overview of the existing literature on AI for peer review and should clearly position the proposed approach within this context. Finally, the authors should consider expanding the scope of their work beyond machine learning papers. While the focus on ML is understandable, the peer review process is also critical in other scientific domains. Exploring the generalizability of the proposed approach to other fields would significantly enhance the impact of the work. These suggestions, if implemented, would address the identified weaknesses and significantly strengthen the paper's overall contribution.\n",

      "This paper introduces Multi-Paper Benchmarking Review (MPBR), a novel approach to scientific peer review that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance the quality and efficiency of the review process. The core idea behind MPBR is to simulate a competitive environment where research papers are not evaluated in isolation but rather in the context of other related works, termed 'benchmarking papers.' This is achieved through a multi-agent system comprising reviewer agents and reviewer manager agents. Reviewer agents are responsible for generating detailed assessments of research papers, considering both the target paper and the benchmarking papers. These reviews are then aggregated and refined by reviewer manager agents, which also handle the selection of relevant benchmarking papers. The authors propose two settings for MPBR: individual review, where each paper is reviewed independently, and collective review, where scores and preferences from multiple reviews are accumulated to update the language model's capabilities. The paper presents a comprehensive benchmark dataset of 16,130 reviews for 5,445 papers, collected from top AI conferences, which serves as the foundation for their experiments. The empirical findings suggest that MPBR can produce more comprehensive and detailed reviews compared to traditional peer review, particularly when using heterogeneous benchmarking papers. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of their agent system in selecting and aggregating reviews, leading to improved review quality. The paper's significance lies in its attempt to address the limitations of traditional peer review by introducing a competitive dynamic and leveraging the capabilities of LLMs to enhance the evaluation process. However, the paper also acknowledges the need for further research to address the challenges and limitations of the proposed approach, such as the potential for bias and the need for more robust evaluation metrics. The authors' work represents a significant step towards automating and improving the scientific peer review process, with the potential to accelerate scientific progress.\n",

      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. The core idea of introducing a competitive dynamic into the peer review process through multi-paper benchmarking is both novel and insightful. By conditioning reviews on related benchmarking papers, the authors have created a system that encourages more comprehensive and detailed evaluations. The use of a multi-agent system, with distinct roles for reviewer agents and reviewer manager agents, is a well-structured approach that allows for the automation of various aspects of the review process. The creation of a large-scale benchmark dataset of 16,130 reviews for 5,445 papers is a significant contribution that provides a valuable resource for future research in this area. The empirical results, which demonstrate the effectiveness of MPBR in generating higher-quality reviews compared to traditional methods, are compelling. The authors' exploration of both homogeneous and heterogeneous benchmarking papers provides valuable insights into the impact of different types of benchmarking on review quality. The use of low-cost training and inference strategies, such as LoRA, FP8 quantization, and DeepSpeed, is a practical approach that makes the system more accessible and efficient. The paper's focus on addressing the limitations of traditional peer review, such as reviewer fatigue and bias, is highly relevant and timely. The authors' efforts to formalize the multi-paper benchmarking review task and to develop a system that can automatically select and aggregate reviews are important steps towards automating the peer review process. The paper's overall contribution to the field of automated peer review is significant, and I believe that the proposed approach has the potential to accelerate scientific progress by improving the quality and efficiency of the review process.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant further discussion. First, the paper's claim that the competitive dynamic among papers leads to more original and significant research ideas lacks empirical support. While the authors state this as a finding, I found no specific experiment or metric dedicated to measuring the impact of the competitive dynamic on the originality and significance of the *review outputs* themselves, as opposed to the research ideas. The paper demonstrates that benchmarking papers improve review quality, but the direct link to fostering more original and significant *research ideas* through this competitive dynamic is not explicitly measured or deeply analyzed. This is a crucial point, as the paper's central argument relies on this connection. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as the paper does show improved review quality with benchmarking, but the link to fostering more original and significant research ideas is not directly measured. Second, the paper's methodology lacks clarity in several areas. The specific prompting strategies used to elicit originality and significance scores from the LLMs are not detailed, making it difficult to reproduce the experiments. The paper also lacks a detailed explanation of how the 'no preference' score is used in the optimization process. The criteria for selecting benchmarking papers are not clearly defined, and the paper does not discuss the potential impact of different selection strategies on the quality of the generated reviews. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed explanation of how the preference loss is calculated and used to update the language model's capabilities. This lack of methodological detail makes it difficult to assess the validity of the results and to build upon the proposed approach. My confidence in this weakness is high, as these details are indeed missing from the paper. Third, the paper's evaluation metrics are limited. The paper primarily uses originality, significance, and P-ROUGE scores, which may not fully capture the nuances of peer review quality. The paper lacks a discussion of the limitations of these metrics and does not explore alternative evaluation approaches, such as qualitative analysis of the generated reviews or user studies with human experts. The paper also does not address the potential for bias in the generated reviews and does not explore methods for mitigating this bias. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's evaluation is indeed limited to a few metrics, and the potential for bias is not addressed. Fourth, the paper's discussion of the computational cost of the proposed approach is insufficient. While the authors mention using low-cost training and inference strategies, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required to train and deploy the MPBR system. This lack of information makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed approach. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper lacks a detailed computational cost analysis. Fifth, the paper does not adequately address the potential for the system to be gamed or to generate biased reviews. The paper lacks a discussion of the ethical implications of using LLMs for peer review and does not explore methods for detecting and mitigating bias in the generated reviews. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not address the potential for bias or discuss ethical implications. Finally, the paper's claim that the system is self-sustaining is not fully supported by the evidence. While the system can select and aggregate reviews with minimal human intervention, the need for periodic updates and retraining suggests that it is not entirely self-sustaining. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as the paper does show some level of automation, but the need for updates and retraining contradicts the claim of being entirely self-sustaining.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should conduct experiments to isolate the effect of the competitive dynamic on the originality and significance of the generated reviews. This could involve comparing the quality of reviews generated with and without the explicit intention of benchmarking, perhaps by using a control group where the LLM is asked to review papers without any reference to other related works. This would help to isolate the effect of the competitive dynamic on the quality of the generated reviews. Furthermore, the authors should explore different methods for quantifying originality and significance, potentially incorporating metrics that are more sensitive to the nuances of research impact. Second, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the prompting strategies used to elicit originality and significance scores from the LLMs. This should include specific examples of the prompts used and a discussion of how these prompts were designed. The authors should also clarify how the 'no preference' score is used in the optimization process and how it affects the overall performance of the system. A more detailed explanation of the benchmarking paper selection process is also needed, including the criteria used to determine relevance and the potential impact of different selection strategies on the quality of the generated reviews. The authors should also provide a more detailed explanation of how the preference loss is calculated and used to update the language model's capabilities. Third, the authors should incorporate more robust evaluation metrics that go beyond simple scoring. This could include metrics that assess the logical consistency of the reviews, the depth of analysis, and the identification of potential flaws in the methodology. The authors should also explore alternative evaluation approaches, such as qualitative analysis of the generated reviews or user studies with human experts. Fourth, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed approach, including the resources required for training and deployment. This analysis should also consider the scalability of the system and its ability to handle large volumes of submissions. Fifth, the authors should address the potential for the system to be gamed or to generate biased reviews. This could involve exploring methods for detecting and mitigating bias in the generated reviews, as well as discussing the ethical implications of using LLMs for peer review. The authors should also consider the potential for adversarial attacks on the system and how these attacks could be prevented. Finally, the authors should clarify the limitations of their approach and acknowledge the need for further research to address these limitations. The authors should also discuss the potential impact of their work on the academic community and the broader society. The authors should also consider the potential for their system to be used in other domains beyond scientific peer review.\n",

      "I have several questions that arise from my analysis of this paper. First, how can the authors more directly measure the impact of the competitive dynamic on the originality and significance of the generated reviews, beyond simply observing improved review quality with benchmarking?

Eighth, how can the system be made more robust against gaming and bias, and what are the ethical implications of using LLMs for peer review? Finally, what are the limitations of the current approach, and what are the most promising directions for future research in this area?\n",

      "This paper introduces AgentReview, a novel framework designed to enhance the quality of scientific peer reviews by leveraging large language models (LLMs). The core idea is to model the review process as a competitive game among multiple LLM agents, each acting as a reviewer, author, or program chair. This multi-agent approach aims to mimic the iterative and adversarial nature of real-world peer review, where reviewers critique each other's work and authors provide feedback. The framework incorporates a reward modeling mechanism to optimize review quality, drawing inspiration from reinforcement learning principles. The authors claim that AgentReview outperforms single-agent baselines, such as GPT-4o and chain-of-thought methods, in terms of review quality, alignment with human reviews, and predictive accuracy of review outcomes. The paper presents empirical evaluations on the ICLR 2024 and NeurIPS submissions, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach. The authors also highlight the connection between their framework and the scientific method, emphasizing the role of competition and critique in improving the quality of reviews. The paper's main contribution lies in its innovative application of multi-agent systems and game theory to the peer review process, offering a potential solution to the challenges of traditional review methods. The authors also emphasize the potential of their approach to accelerate scientific discovery by providing high-quality feedback to researchers. The paper's findings suggest that LLMs can be effectively used to augment and improve the peer review process, potentially leading to more efficient and rigorous scientific evaluation. The authors also plan to make their code, dataset, and related resources publicly available to facilitate further research in this area. The paper's overall significance lies in its exploration of a novel application of LLMs to a critical aspect of scientific research, offering a promising avenue for future development and improvement of the peer review process.\n",

      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. First, the paper tackles a significant and timely problem: the need to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific peer review. The authors' approach of using LLMs to simulate and enhance this process is both innovative and relevant. The multi-agent framework, where LLMs compete as reviewers, authors, and program chairs, is a novel approach that mimics the adversarial nature of real-world peer review. This competitive setting, combined with the incorporation of author feedback, allows for iterative refinement of reviews, which I believe is a key strength of the proposed method. The use of a reward modeling mechanism to optimize review quality is another notable contribution. This mechanism, inspired by reinforcement learning, provides a principled way to guide the LLMs towards generating higher-quality reviews. The empirical evaluations on the ICLR 2024 and NeurIPS submissions provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that AgentReview outperforms single-agent baselines in terms of review quality, alignment with human reviews, and predictive accuracy of review outcomes. The authors' decision to make their code, dataset, and related resources publicly available is also commendable, as it will facilitate further research and development in this area. The paper's connection to the scientific method, emphasizing the role of competition and critique, is also a valuable contribution, highlighting the theoretical underpinnings of their approach. Overall, I am impressed by the paper's innovative approach, strong empirical results, and potential to improve the peer review process.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a detailed explanation of the reward modeling mechanism. While the authors introduce the concept of a reviewer reward model, they do not provide specifics on its architecture, training data, or features. The paper states that the reward model is trained to predict which review is most likely to lead to a high-quality paper, but it does not explain how 'high-quality' is defined or measured. The authors also mention that they do not derive the reward model but assume its existence, which I find to be a significant limitation. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the validity of the reward model and its impact on the overall performance of AgentReview. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper explicitly states that the reward model is assumed rather than derived, and lacks specific details on its implementation. Second, the paper does not adequately address the computational cost and scalability of the proposed approach. The multi-agent competition game, with its iterative review refinement process, is likely to be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex reviews. The paper does not provide any analysis of the time and resources required to train and run the model, nor does it discuss potential strategies for reducing computational overhead. This lack of discussion raises concerns about the practical applicability of the proposed approach in real-world scenarios. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper describes a computationally intensive process but lacks any discussion of its computational cost or scalability. Third, the paper's experimental setup raises concerns about potential data leakage. The authors use the ICLR 2024 dataset, which includes papers published in the past. Since LLMs are pre-trained on vast amounts of internet data, including scientific publications, there is a risk that the LLMs might have been exposed to the content of the ICLR 2024 papers during their pre-training phase. This potential data leakage could inflate the reported performance metrics and make it difficult to generalize the findings to future conferences. The paper does not address this issue or discuss strategies to mitigate it. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper uses a dataset of published papers without addressing the potential for data leakage from the LLM's pre-training data. Fourth, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of the ethical implications of using LLMs for peer review. While the authors mention the potential for bias amplification, they do not delve into specific ethical concerns such as fairness, accountability, transparency, and the potential for misuse. The paper also does not discuss the potential for the model to be used to generate biased or unfair reviews, or the impact of such reviews on the careers of early-career researchers. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper lacks a detailed discussion of ethical implications, focusing mainly on performance metrics. Fifth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the types of errors that the model makes. While the paper presents overall performance metrics, it does not provide insights into the specific types of mistakes that the model makes, such as factual errors, logical fallacies, or biases. This lack of analysis makes it difficult to identify areas for improvement and to understand the limitations of the proposed approach. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper focuses on overall performance metrics without a detailed error analysis. Sixth, the paper does not adequately justify the choice of baselines. The authors compare AgentReview against GPT-4o and chain-of-thought methods, but they do not provide a detailed rationale for why these baselines were chosen over other relevant methods, particularly those that use LLMs for single-agent review generation. This lack of justification makes it difficult to assess the true novelty and effectiveness of the proposed approach. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper lacks a detailed justification for the chosen baselines, especially regarding single-agent LLM review generation methods. Finally, the paper does not provide sufficient details on the human evaluation process. The paper mentions that volunteers and authors rated the generated reviews, but it does not provide details on the recruitment of these volunteers, their expertise, or the specific instructions they were given. The paper also does not discuss any measures taken to ensure the reliability and consistency of the human ratings. My confidence in this issue is high, as the paper lacks details on the human evaluation process, including volunteer selection and reliability measures.\n",

      "This paper introduces AIReviewer and AIResearch, two innovative agents designed to automate scientific peer review and idea generation, respectively. AIReviewer is an interactive system that engages in multi-round discussions with authors to provide detailed feedback on scientific papers, mimicking the iterative nature of traditional peer review. AIResearch, on the other hand, employs a debate-style conversation between two AI agents to generate and refine scientific ideas, which are then ranked using a trained AI4Science Reward Model. The authors present a benchmark dataset of AI-generated reviews and conduct a large-scale human study to evaluate the performance of AIReviewer, finding that its reviews are comparable in quality to those of intermediate reviewers. Furthermore, they demonstrate that AIResearch can efficiently generate novel and high-quality scientific ideas, outperforming the PACCAR benchmark in terms of generation speed and perceived quality. The core methodological approach involves leveraging large language models (LLMs) to simulate the processes of peer review and scientific brainstorming. AIReviewer iteratively refines its reviews based on author responses, while AIResearch uses a debate mechanism to explore and evaluate research ideas. The AI4Science Reward Model, trained on preference data from AIReview, is used to rank the generated ideas. The main empirical findings include the comparable performance of AIReview to intermediate human reviewers, the ability of AIResearch to generate novel and high-quality ideas, and the impact of different LLMs on the performance of both agents. The authors also explore the impact of author choice and iteration on the quality of generated ideas. Overall, this work is significant for its attempt to automate key aspects of the scientific process, potentially reducing the burden on human researchers and accelerating scientific discovery. The paper also contributes a new benchmark dataset for evaluating AI-generated reviews and provides insights into the capabilities of LLMs for scientific tasks. However, the paper also reveals some limitations, particularly in the depth of analysis and the potential for bias in the evaluation process, which I will discuss in detail in the following sections.\n",

      "\n",
      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. The most notable is the innovative approach to automating scientific peer review and idea generation using LLMs. The concept of AIReviewer, which engages in multi-round discussions with authors, is a significant step towards mimicking the interactive nature of traditional peer review. This iterative process, where the AI refines its feedback based on author responses, is a key strength. Similarly, the debate-style idea generation in AIResearch, where two AI agents engage in a conversation to explore and evaluate research ideas, is a novel approach that leverages the capabilities of LLMs for creative tasks. The authors' decision to create a benchmark dataset of AI-generated reviews is also a valuable contribution, as it provides a resource for future research in this area. The large-scale human study conducted to evaluate AIReview is another strength, as it provides empirical evidence for the quality of the AI-generated reviews. The study, involving over 7,000 comparisons, demonstrates that AIReview's performance is comparable to that of intermediate human reviewers. Furthermore, the paper's exploration of the impact of different LLMs on the performance of AIReview and AIResearch is a valuable contribution, as it provides insights into the capabilities of various models for scientific tasks. The finding that the performance of the LLM agent in AIResearch follows the trend: Scaling Scale > Model Version > Model Architecture > Model Brand is an interesting and useful observation. Finally, the paper's demonstration that AIResearch can generate novel and high-quality ideas at a faster rate than the PACCAR benchmark is a significant achievement. The authors show that AIResearch achieves higher scores in importance and feasibility while maintaining high novelty, which suggests that the system is not just generating ideas quickly but also generating ideas that are potentially valuable.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a detailed explanation of the prompts used for AIReviewer and AIResearch. While the authors mention that the prompts are included in the appendix, the main text lacks a description of the prompt engineering process. This is a significant omission, as the design of the prompts can greatly influence the performance of LLMs. Without a clear understanding of how the prompts were designed and refined, it is difficult to assess the robustness and generalizability of the proposed methods. This lack of transparency also makes it challenging to reproduce the results or adapt the system to new tasks. Second, the paper does not adequately address the potential for bias in the evaluation process. The authors use the same set of ground-truth reviews from the ISMRL dataset for both exposure and evaluation, which could introduce bias into the human evaluations. This is because human preferences might be influenced by the format or style of the reviews, rather than their actual quality. The paper does not report inter-annotator agreement scores, which further exacerbates this issue. Without knowing the level of agreement between human evaluators, it is difficult to assess the reliability of the evaluation results. Third, the paper lacks sufficient detail regarding the training process of the AI4Science Reward Model. While the authors mention that they use DeepSpeed, F8 Quantization, and LoRA, they do not provide specific hyperparameter settings, such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the training process and assess the robustness of the results. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a clear justification for the choice of Llama3-8B as the base model for the reward model, especially since the main experiments use Qwen2.5-7B. Fourth, the paper's analysis of the experimental results is somewhat superficial. While the authors present quantitative metrics, such as ROUGE-L scores and human preference percentages, they do not provide a detailed qualitative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the AI-generated reviews and ideas. For example, the paper does not analyze the types of errors that AIReview is prone to make or the specific characteristics of the generated ideas that contribute to their novelty and feasibility. This lack of in-depth analysis limits the insights that can be gained from the experiments. Fifth, the paper does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed approach. While the authors acknowledge that the quality of the AI agents' output depends on the underlying LLMs, they do not discuss other potential limitations, such as the potential for bias in the training data or the ethical implications of using AI for peer review. The paper also does not discuss the potential for the AI agents to generate reviews or ideas that are not scientifically sound or that are potentially harmful. Sixth, the paper's presentation could be improved. The term \"accepted reviews\" is not clearly defined, and the paper lacks a detailed description of the human evaluation process. The paper also does not provide a clear explanation of the \"Iterative Improvement\" mentioned in Figure 2. Finally, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of how the reward model is used to rank the generated ideas. While the paper mentions that the reward model is trained on preference data from AIReview, it does not explain how the reward scores are used to select the best ideas. The paper also does not discuss the potential for the reward model to be biased or to favor certain types of ideas over others. These weaknesses, taken together, limit the overall impact of the paper and highlight areas for future improvement. My confidence in these identified weaknesses is high, as they are based on direct examination of the paper's content and are supported by multiple reviewers.\n",

      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements for this paper. First, the authors should provide a detailed description of the prompt engineering process in the main text. This should include the specific prompts used for AIReviewer and AIResearch, as well as the rationale behind their design. The authors should also discuss how they refined the prompts and how they plan to maintain and update them as the system is used on a larger scale. This would improve the transparency and reproducibility of the research. Second, the authors should address the potential for bias in the evaluation process. This could be done by using a different set of ground-truth reviews for exposure and evaluation, or by using a more robust evaluation methodology that accounts for potential biases. The authors should also report inter-annotator agreement scores to assess the reliability of the human evaluations. Third, the authors should provide more details regarding the training process of the AI4Science Reward Model. This should include specific hyperparameter settings, as well as a clear justification for the choice of Llama3-8B as the base model. The authors should also discuss the computational resources used for training and the training time. Fourth, the authors should conduct a more in-depth analysis of the experimental results. This should include a qualitative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the AI-generated reviews and ideas, as well as an exploration of the types of errors that AIReview is prone to make. The authors should also analyze the specific characteristics of the generated ideas that contribute to their novelty and feasibility. Fifth, the authors should address the limitations of the proposed approach more thoroughly. This should include a discussion of the potential for bias in the training data, the ethical implications of using AI for peer review, and the potential for the AI agents to generate reviews or ideas that are not scientifically sound. The authors should also discuss the potential for the AI agents to be used for malicious purposes. Sixth, the authors should improve the presentation of the paper. This should include a clear definition of the term \"accepted reviews,\" a detailed description of the human evaluation process, and a clear explanation of the \"Iterative Improvement\" mentioned in Figure 2. The authors should also provide more details about the AI4Science Reward Model and how it is used to rank the generated ideas. Finally, the authors should consider expanding the scope of their experiments to include a wider range of scientific disciplines and paper types. This would help to assess the generalizability of the proposed approach and identify potential areas for improvement. These suggestions, if implemented, would significantly strengthen the paper and address the identified weaknesses.\n",

      "This paper introduces PEER REVIEW AS ITERATIVE REFINEMENT (PAIR), a novel framework designed to enhance the quality of scientific peer reviews using large language models (LLMs). The core idea of PAIR is to simulate the iterative nature of the review process through a two-agent system consisting of a Reviewer LLM and a Critic LLM. The Reviewer LLM generates initial reviews, which are then evaluated and refined based on feedback from the Critic LLM. This process can be repeated multiple times, allowing for iterative improvement of the review quality. The authors explore different feedback modes for the Critic, including ranking, rejection, and construction feedback, and employ reinforcement learning (RL) to train both the Reviewer and Critic agents. The Reviewer agent is trained using a combination of preference tuning and RL, leveraging a dataset of human reviews from the Computer Physics Communications (CPC) journal. The paper's main empirical finding is that the PAIR framework, particularly when using GPT-4L as the reviewer agent, can generate reviews that achieve a high level of usefulness, as measured by a composite score based on evaluation, motivation, and clarity. The authors also demonstrate that fine-tuning the LLMs on domain-specific data further enhances performance. The overall significance of this work lies in its attempt to automate and improve the peer review process, a critical component of scientific publishing, by leveraging the capabilities of LLMs and RL. This research contributes to the growing body of work exploring the use of AI in scientific workflows and offers a promising approach to addressing the challenges of traditional peer review.\n",

      "\n",
      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. First, the core idea of using an iterative refinement process with a Reviewer and Critic agent is both intuitive and innovative. It effectively leverages the capabilities of LLMs to simulate the back-and-forth nature of real-world peer review. The use of reinforcement learning to train both agents is also a significant strength, as it allows the system to learn from its mistakes and improve over time. The authors' exploration of different feedback modes for the Critic agent, and their eventual focus on construction feedback, demonstrates a thoughtful approach to optimizing the framework. Furthermore, the empirical results presented in the paper are compelling. The fact that the PAIR framework, particularly with GPT-4L, can achieve such high usefulness scores suggests that this approach has the potential to significantly improve the quality of automated reviews. The use of a real-world dataset of human reviews from the CPC journal adds to the credibility of the findings. Finally, the authors' decision to fine-tune the LLMs on domain-specific data is a practical step that enhances the relevance of their work to real-world applications. Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated, technically sound, and empirically validated approach to automating scientific peer review.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a clear and detailed explanation of the reinforcement learning process. While the authors mention using RL and provide the loss function, they do not explicitly define the state and action spaces for either the Reviewer or Critic agent. This omission makes it difficult to fully understand how the agents interact and learn within the RL framework. For instance, the paper states that the reviewer agent acts as the actor, learning to generate and refine reviews based on the critic's feedback, which serves as the critic. The process is described as a two-player zero-sum game, where the reviewer aims to maximize the usefulness of its reviews, while the critic provides feedback to guide this improvement. However, the specific mechanisms of how the critic's feedback is translated into a reward signal for the reviewer, and how the critic itself is trained, are not sufficiently detailed. This lack of clarity makes it challenging to assess the validity of the RL approach and its contribution to the overall performance of the PAIR framework. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not provide the necessary details for a complete understanding of the RL implementation. Second, the paper's evaluation methodology raises concerns about potential overfitting. The authors use a dataset from the AI Index 2023 Annual Report for evaluation, and they mention filtering the ReviewGPT dataset by setting the overall usefulness score to null and sampling every other entry. However, they do not explicitly state whether the AI Index 2023 Annual Report was part of the training data or how the evaluation data was handled to prevent overlap with the training data. This lack of transparency makes it difficult to rule out the possibility that the reported performance gains are due to overfitting to a specific dataset rather than a general improvement in review quality. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as the paper lacks explicit details on the handling of the evaluation data. Third, the paper's reliance on a single utility function in the ranking feedback mode is a potential limitation. The authors state that using a single utility function enhances the clarity of the ranking process, but they also acknowledge that this approach diminishes the improvement observed in evaluation. This suggests that the single utility function may not fully capture the multi-faceted nature of review quality, potentially leading to suboptimal learning. The paper does not explore the use of multiple utility functions or other methods for balancing different aspects of review quality, which could be a valuable avenue for future research. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper itself acknowledges the limitations of the single utility function. Fourth, the paper's use of a common words metric to determine the quality difference between two reviews is a significant weakness. The authors define a comparison score based on the number of common words between two reviews, which they use to assign positive and negative examples for training. However, this metric is highly susceptible to common phrases and may not accurately reflect the semantic content or quality of the reviews. This could lead to the model being trained on noisy or misleading data, potentially hindering its ability to generate high-quality reviews. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's description of the metric highlights its limitations. Finally, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of the ethical implications of using AI to generate peer reviews. While the authors mention the potential for bias, they do not delve into the specific ethical challenges, such as transparency, accountability, and the potential for misuse. This omission is a significant weakness, as the ethical considerations of AI in peer review are crucial and require careful attention. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not include a dedicated section or detailed discussion on the ethical implications of their work.\n",

The authors should also explain how the Critic agent is trained and how its feedback is translated into a reward signal for the Reviewer. This additional detail would greatly enhance the clarity and reproducibility of their work. Second, the authors should address the potential for overfitting by providing more information about the training and evaluation datasets. They should explicitly state whether the AI Index 2023 Annual Report was part of the training data and describe any measures taken to prevent overlap between the training and evaluation sets. They should also consider evaluating their framework on additional, unseen datasets to demonstrate its generalizability. Third, the authors should explore alternative methods for determining the quality difference between reviews, rather than relying solely on the common words metric. This could involve using more sophisticated semantic similarity metrics or incorporating human annotations. They should also investigate the use of multiple utility functions or other methods for balancing different aspects of review quality, such as evaluation, motivation, and clarity. Fourth, the authors should include a more thorough discussion of the ethical implications of using AI to generate peer reviews. This discussion should address issues such as transparency, accountability, the potential for bias, and the need for human oversight. They should also consider the potential for misuse of AI-generated reviews and propose safeguards to mitigate these risks. Finally, the authors should consider including a baseline comparison with a single-agent RL approach that directly optimizes for review quality, as defined by the reward function. This would help to isolate the benefits of the multi-agent approach and provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the PAIR framework. These changes would significantly strengthen the paper and address the identified limitations.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "I have several questions that arise from my analysis of this paper. First, I am curious about the specific implementation of the reinforcement learning algorithm. While the paper mentions using self-verifying RL, it does not provide details on the specific RL algorithm used, the hyperparameter settings, or the training procedure. Could the authors elaborate on these aspects of their implementation? Second, I am interested in the authors' rationale for choosing the specific reward function used for training the Reviewer agent. The paper defines the reward function based on the usefulness of the review, but it does not explain why this particular formulation was chosen over other possible alternatives. Could the authors provide more insight into their choice of reward function? Third, I am curious about the authors' decision to use a single utility function in the ranking feedback mode. Given that they acknowledge that this approach diminishes the improvement observed in evaluation, why did they not explore the use of multiple utility functions or other methods for balancing different aspects of review quality?

What are the main challenges to deploying this framework in practice, and what steps would need to be taken to address these challenges? Finally, I am curious about the authors' perspective on the limitations of using LLMs to simulate the subjective aspects of peer review. While the paper focuses on improving the usefulness of reviews, how can the PAIR framework be extended to address other important aspects of peer review, such as fairness, ethics, and the evaluation of novelty? These questions are intended to clarify key uncertainties and explore the broader implications of the authors' work.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation and appears to be an experimental study without clear motivation or significant contributions. The connection to \"scientific discovery\" feels tenuous, as the work focuses on peer review simulation rather than the discovery process itself. The claims in the introduction, particularly regarding the integration of AI in hypothesis generation, experimental design, data analysis, and peer review, are broad and not sufficiently supported by the current work, which narrowly focuses on peer review simulation. The paper does not adequately address how this simulation contributes to the broader scientific method beyond potentially improving review efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The methodology lacks sufficient detail, particularly regarding training configurations and the training process itself. While the main text mentions using DPO for training, the specifics of how the model is trained to simulate peer review are not clear. For example, the paper does not specify the loss function used, the optimization algorithm, or the specific data preprocessing steps. The description of the JSON configuration for SPRA is also too high-level, lacking details on the specific fields and how they influence the review generation process. Furthermore, it is unclear how the human feedback is quantified and incorporated into the training process beyond a high-level description of DPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The experimental design and results are not presented with sufficient clarity. For instance, Table 2 lacks descriptions of what each question type represents, making it difficult to interpret the results. The paper also does not provide any statistical analysis of the results, such as confidence intervals or p-values, making it difficult to assess the significance of the reported improvements. Additionally, the evaluation relies heavily on metrics that may not fully capture the quality and nuance of peer reviews. The paper does not include any analysis of the types of errors the model makes or how these errors compare to those made by human reviewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper needs a more robust theoretical framing that clearly articulates the connection between peer review simulation and the broader scientific discovery process. The introduction should be revised to more accurately reflect the scope of the work and avoid overclaiming the impact on scientific discovery. The authors should provide a clear rationale for why simulating peer review is a valuable endeavor, beyond simply automating the process. This could involve discussing the limitations of current peer review systems and how the proposed approach addresses these limitations, or how the simulation could be used to train better models for other tasks. The authors should also clarify the specific research question they are trying to answer, which currently seems to be focused on achieving high performance on the RewardBench benchmark, without a clear connection to the stated goal of enhancing scientific discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The methodology section needs to be significantly expanded to provide a detailed explanation of the training process. This should include a clear description of the data used for training, the specific loss function and optimization algorithm employed, and the data preprocessing steps. The authors should also provide a detailed explanation of the JSON configuration for SPRA, including the specific fields and how they influence the review generation process. The paper should also clarify how human feedback is quantified and incorporated into the training process, including the specific mathematical formulation of the DPO objective function. The authors should also provide a detailed explanation of the convergence criteria used for the iterative training process, including how the human evaluators assess the quality of the generated reviews and how this assessment is used to determine when the model has converged. The paper should also include an ablation study to evaluate the impact of different components of the proposed approach, such as the use of human feedback and the specific training algorithm.\n",

      "1. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for training and deploying the SPRA and HLL-RA models. This information is crucial for assessing the practicality of the proposed framework, especially in resource-constrained environments. The lack of specifics regarding GPU memory usage, training time per epoch, and the number of GPUs used makes it difficult to reproduce the results or assess the scalability of the approach. Furthermore, the paper does not discuss the energy consumption associated with training these models, which is an important consideration for sustainable research practices.\n",
      "2. The paper lacks a thorough discussion of potential biases in the training data and how these biases might affect the performance of the SPRA and HLL-RA models. It is essential to analyze the demographic and institutional representation in the training data to ensure that the models do not perpetuate existing inequalities in the peer review process. For example, if the training data predominantly consists of reviews from well-established institutions, the models might be biased against submissions from less prominent institutions or underrepresented groups. The paper should also address potential biases related to research topics, methodologies, and writing styles.\n",
      "3. The paper does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed method in handling complex or interdisciplinary research topics. The framework's ability to evaluate research that spans multiple disciplines or employs novel methodologies is unclear. It is important to understand how the models handle cases where the boundaries between disciplines are blurred or where the evaluation criteria are not well-defined. The paper should also discuss the potential for the models to be gamed or manipulated, and how this could affect the integrity of the review process.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the lack of computational resource details, the authors should provide a comprehensive breakdown of the hardware and software used for training and evaluation. This should include the specific GPU models, the number of GPUs used in parallel, the amount of GPU memory required, the training time per epoch, and the total training time. Additionally, the authors should report the energy consumption associated with training the models, which is an important factor for assessing the sustainability of the approach. This information should be presented in a clear and concise manner, allowing other researchers to assess the feasibility of replicating the experiments. Furthermore, the authors should discuss the scalability of the approach, including how the computational cost scales with the size of the training data and the complexity of the models. This would help to understand the practical limitations of the proposed framework in different research settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate potential biases, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of the training data, including the demographic and institutional representation of the reviewers and authors. This analysis should be used to identify potential biases and develop strategies to mitigate them. For example, the authors could use techniques such as data augmentation or re-weighting to balance the representation of different groups. The paper should also discuss how the models handle cases where the training data is limited or biased. Furthermore, the authors should explore the use of fairness metrics to evaluate the performance of the models across different demographic and institutional groups. This would help to ensure that the models do not perpetuate existing inequalities in the peer review process. The authors should also consider the potential for adversarial attacks and develop strategies to make the models more robust to manipulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the limitations in handling complex or interdisciplinary research topics, the authors should conduct a more detailed analysis of the model's performance on such topics. This analysis should include examples of cases where the models perform well and cases where they struggle. The authors should also explore the use of techniques such as multi-task learning or transfer learning to improve the models' ability to handle complex and interdisciplinary research. Furthermore, the authors should discuss the limitations of the proposed framework in handling novel methodologies or research that challenges established paradigms.

      "1. Weakness Statement: The paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation and appears to be an experimental study without clear motivation or significant contributions. The connection to \"scientific discovery\" feels tenuous, as the work focuses on peer review simulation rather than the discovery process itself. The claims in the introduction, particularly regarding the integration of AI in hypothesis generation, experimental design, data analysis, and peer review, are broad and not sufficiently supported by the current work, which narrowly focuses on peer review simulation. The paper does not adequately address how this simulation contributes to the broader scientific method beyond potentially improving review efficiency.\n",

While the main text mentions using DPO for training, the specifics of how the model is trained to simulate peer review are not clear. For example, the paper does not specify the loss function used, the optimization algorithm, or the specific data preprocessing steps. The description of the JSON configuration for SPRA is also too high-level, lacking details on the specific fields and how they influence the review generation process. Furthermore, it is unclear how the human feedback is quantified and incorporated into the training process beyond a high-level description of DPO.\n",

The model update process may involve fine-tuning the LLMs' parameters to better reflect the quality and type of feedback indicated by the chosen reviews and human evaluations.\" (Section 4.1)\n",
      "        - LLM Alignment with Human Judgment: \"To fine-tune the LLM, we employed the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) technique~\\citep{hu2022lora}, following the LoRA-GA approach of \\citet{wang2024loragalowrankadaptationgradient}. This method updates both the query and value matrices in the attention mechanism of the LLM. We set the rank to $32$ and the dropout rate to $0.05$, while keeping the learning rate and batch size at their default values. The model was trained for $3$ epochs with an effective batch size of $128$, using a cosine learning rate scheduler that starts at $10^{-5}$ and includes $1000$ warmup steps. To optimize the training process, we enabled gradient checkpointing and gradient accumulation. The training was conducted on $4$ NVIDIA RTX 4090 servers, each equipped with $4$ GPUs, utilizing the DeepSpeed library~\\citep{rajbhandari2020zeromemoryoptimizationstraining,10.1145/3394486.3406703} with ZeRO Stage 1 and FP8 quantization~\\citep{kuzmin2024fp8quantizationpowerexponent} to enhance efficiency and reduce memory usage.\" (Section 5.1)\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel framework for simulating and optimizing scientific peer review using large language models (LLMs). The authors propose two main components: the Scientific Peer Reviewer Agent (SPRA), which simulates peer reviews based on a JSON configuration, and the Human-LLM Reviewer Agent (HLL-RA), which iteratively refines these simulations by incorporating human feedback to better align with human judgment. The SPRA is configured to analyze various components of a scientific paper, such as the abstract, introduction, and methodology, and to identify potential issues like statistical errors or unethical research practices. The HLL-RA then uses human feedback to select the most appropriate reviews, which are subsequently used to fine-tune the LLMs using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This iterative process aims to improve the quality and alignment of the generated reviews with human standards. The authors validate their approach through experiments on the RewardBench benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance, and by creating a new synthetic dataset (Syn-RS) of high-quality reviews rated by humans. The core contribution of this work lies in its attempt to automate and enhance the peer review process through LLMs, addressing the challenges of reviewer bias and inefficiency. The paper also introduces a new dataset, Syn-RS, which could serve as a valuable resource for future research in this area. The authors frame their work within the context of Langley's computational model, suggesting a broader aim to enhance scientific discovery through improved peer review. However, the paper's primary focus remains on the simulation and optimization of the peer review process itself, rather than directly contributing to other aspects of scientific discovery. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving high performance on the RewardBench benchmark and in generating high-quality synthetic reviews. The paper's approach of using human feedback to iteratively refine LLM-generated reviews is a practical method for improving the alignment of these models with human judgment. Overall, the paper presents a significant step towards automating and improving the scientific peer review process, but it also reveals several areas that require further investigation and refinement.\n",

      "This paper presents several notable strengths, primarily in its innovative approach to simulating and optimizing scientific peer review using LLMs. The introduction of the Scientific Peer Reviewer Agent (SPRA) and the Human-LLM Reviewer Agent (HLL-RA) represents a novel contribution to the field of automated scientific review. The SPRA's configuration, which guides the LLM to analyze different sections of a paper and identify specific issues, is a well-structured approach to simulating the peer review process. The HLL-RA, with its iterative optimization process that incorporates human feedback, is a practical method for aligning LLM-generated reviews with human judgment. The creation of the Syn-RS dataset, which includes human-rated reviews, is a valuable contribution that could serve as a benchmark for future research in this area. The paper's empirical results, particularly the state-of-the-art performance on the RewardBench benchmark, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors also provide a detailed description of the fine-tuning process, including the use of LoRA and DPO, which is beneficial for reproducibility. The paper's framing within Langley's computational model, while not fully explored, suggests a broader aim to enhance scientific discovery through improved peer review. The use of human feedback to iteratively refine LLM-generated reviews is a practical method for improving the alignment of these models with human judgment. The paper's focus on addressing the challenges of reviewer bias and inefficiency is also a significant strength, as it highlights the potential impact of this work on the scientific community. The authors' approach of using a JSON configuration for SPRA provides a structured and transparent way to guide the LLM's review process. The paper's experimental design, which includes both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, is also a strength, as it provides a comprehensive assessment of the proposed method. The authors' commitment to further investigating and addressing potential biases in their system, as mentioned in the ethics statement, is also commendable. The paper's overall contribution lies in its attempt to automate and enhance the peer review process through LLMs, which has the potential to significantly impact how scientific research is evaluated and disseminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its strengths, this paper exhibits several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation, and the connection to the broader concept of scientific discovery feels somewhat tenuous. While the introduction mentions Langley's computational model, the paper primarily focuses on the simulation of peer review rather than the broader scientific method. The claims in the introduction, particularly regarding the integration of AI in hypothesis generation, experimental design, and data analysis, are not sufficiently supported by the current work, which narrowly focuses on peer review simulation. The paper does not adequately address how this simulation contributes to scientific progress beyond potentially improving review efficiency. This is a partially valid concern, as the paper's primary focus is on peer review simulation, and while it aims to contribute to scientific discovery, the connection could be more explicitly and deeply explored. Second, the methodology lacks sufficient detail, particularly regarding the SPRA's JSON configuration and the precise mathematical formulation of how human feedback is integrated into the DPO framework. While the paper mentions using DPO for training, the specifics of how the model is trained to simulate peer review are not entirely clear. The description of the JSON configuration for SPRA is also too high-level, lacking details on the specific fields and how they influence the review generation process. Furthermore, it is unclear how the human feedback is quantified and incorporated into the training process beyond a high-level description of DPO. This is a partially valid concern, as the paper provides some methodological details, especially regarding fine-tuning, but lacks fine-grained specifics on the SPRA JSON configuration and the precise mathematical formulation of how human feedback is integrated into DPO. Third, the experimental design and results are not presented with sufficient clarity. Table 2 lacks descriptions of what each question type represents, making it difficult to interpret the results. The paper also does not provide any statistical analysis of the results, such as confidence intervals or p-values, making it difficult to assess the significance of the reported improvements. Additionally, the evaluation relies heavily on metrics that may not fully capture the quality and nuance of peer reviews. The paper does not include any analysis of the types of errors the model makes or how these errors compare to those made by human reviewers. This is a valid concern, as the experimental design and results presentation lack clarity due to missing question type descriptions, absence of statistical analysis, and limited error analysis. Fourth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for training and deploying the SPRA and HLL-RA models. While the paper mentions the hardware used (4 RTX 4090 servers with 4 GPUs each) and the training duration (3 epochs), it does not explicitly state the training time per epoch, memory usage, or energy consumption. This is a partially valid concern, as the paper provides some hardware details but lacks specifics on training time per epoch, memory usage, and energy consumption. Fifth, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of potential biases in the training data and how these biases might affect the performance of the SPRA and HLL-RA models. The paper acknowledges the potential for bias in the Qwen2.5-72B-Chat model but does not include a detailed analysis of biases in the training data itself. This is a valid concern, as the paper lacks a discussion and analysis of potential biases in the training data. Sixth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed method. It does not discuss the scenarios where the SPRA and HLL-RA models may not perform well, such as when evaluating interdisciplinary research or papers that challenge established paradigms. This is a valid concern, as the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed method. Finally, the paper does not compare the proposed method with other existing approaches for scientific peer review, such as traditional peer review or crowdsourced review. This is a valid concern, as the paper lacks a comparison with traditional and crowdsourced peer review methods. These weaknesses, while not invalidating the paper's contributions, highlight areas that require further investigation and refinement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the paper needs a more robust theoretical framing that clearly articulates the connection between peer review simulation and the broader scientific discovery process. The introduction should be revised to more accurately reflect the scope of the work and avoid overclaiming the impact on scientific discovery. The authors should provide a clear rationale for why simulating peer review is a valuable endeavor, beyond simply automating the process. This could involve discussing the limitations of current peer review systems and how the proposed approach addresses these limitations, or how the simulation could be used to train better models for other tasks. The authors should also clarify the specific research question they are trying to answer, which currently seems to be focused on achieving high performance on the RewardBench benchmark, without a clear connection to the stated goal of enhancing scientific discovery. Second, the methodology section needs to be significantly expanded to provide a detailed explanation of the training process. This should include a clear description of the data used for training, the specific loss function and optimization algorithm employed, and the data preprocessing steps. The authors should also provide a detailed explanation of the JSON configuration for SPRA, including the specific fields and how they influence the review generation process. The paper should also clarify how human feedback is quantified and incorporated into the training process, including the specific mathematical formulation of the DPO objective function. The authors should also provide a detailed explanation of the convergence criteria used for the iterative training process, including how the human evaluators assess the quality of the generated reviews and how this assessment is used to determine when the model has converged. The paper should also include an ablation study to evaluate the impact of different components of the proposed approach, such as the use of human feedback and the specific training algorithm. Third, the experimental design and results need to be presented with more clarity and rigor. The authors should provide a detailed description of each question type in Table 2, including examples of the questions and how they relate to the evaluation of peer reviews. The paper should also include a statistical analysis of the results, such as confidence intervals or p-values, to assess the significance of the reported improvements. The authors should also include an analysis of the types of errors the model makes and how these errors compare to those made by human reviewers. The evaluation metrics should be carefully considered to ensure they capture the quality and nuance of peer reviews. The authors should also consider using human evaluations to assess the quality of the generated reviews, in addition to the automated metrics. The paper should also include a discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach and potential avenues for future research. Fourth, the paper should include a more detailed analysis of the computational resources required for training and deploying the SPRA and HLL-RA models. This analysis should include the number of GPUs, the training time, and the memory usage. Furthermore, the authors should provide a breakdown of the computational cost for each stage of the process, such as the initial training of the SPRA models, the iterative fine-tuning of the HLL-RA models, and the generation of reviews. This information is crucial for assessing the practicality of the approach, especially for researchers with limited computational resources. It would also be beneficial to discuss the scalability of the method and how the computational cost might change with larger datasets or more complex models. This analysis should also include a discussion of the energy consumption of the proposed method, which is an important consideration for sustainable research practices. Fifth, the paper should also include a thorough analysis of potential biases in the training data and how these biases might affect the performance of the SPRA and HLL-RA models. The authors should investigate biases related to author demographics, institutional affiliations, research topics, and other relevant factors. They should also discuss how these biases might be amplified by the models and lead to unfair or inaccurate evaluations. For example, if the training data primarily consists of reviews of papers from well-established institutions, the models might be biased against papers from less well-known institutions. The authors should also discuss mitigation strategies for addressing these biases, such as using debiasing techniques or ensuring that the training data is representative of the diversity of scientific research. A detailed analysis of the potential biases and mitigation strategies is crucial for ensuring the fairness and reliability of the proposed method. Sixth, the paper should provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed method. The authors should discuss the scenarios where the SPRA and HLL-RA models may not perform well, such as when evaluating interdisciplinary research, papers that challenge established paradigms, or papers that use novel methodologies. They should also discuss the potential for the models to be gamed or manipulated, and how this could affect the integrity of the review process. A discussion of these limitations would provide a more balanced view of the approach and help guide future research. Finally, the paper should compare the proposed method with other existing approaches for scientific peer review, such as traditional peer review or crowdsourced review. This comparison should include an analysis of the performance, cost, and limitations of each approach, and should help to contextualize the contribution of the proposed method and identify areas for improvement.\n",

Furthermore, the paper needs to justify the choice of datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The authors should consider using more comprehensive evaluation metrics, such as the quality of the feedback provided by the LLM agents, and compare the proposed method to a wider range of baselines, including human reviewers. The current evaluation is limited to a single dataset and a few baselines, which makes it difficult to assess the robustness and generalizability of the proposed method.\n",

The authors should also consider conducting more experiments to evaluate the performance of their method on different datasets and with different LLMs. The paper should also include a more comprehensive discussion of related work, including a detailed comparison of the proposed method to existing approaches. The authors should also discuss the limitations of their method and potential directions for future research. For example, the authors could explore the use of different types of LLMs, the impact of different prompt designs, and the potential for using the proposed method in real-world peer review scenarios. The authors should also address the potential ethical concerns associated with using LLMs to simulate peer review, such as the potential for bias and the lack of transparency.\n",

      "The paper introduces Multi-Agent Review (MARP), a novel approach that uses multiple large language models (LLMs) to simulate the traditional peer review process. In MARP, several LLMs independently review a paper, provide feedback to each other, and iteratively refine their reviews, leading to a consensus conclusion. The authors also employ an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm to fine-tune a reward model, enhancing the accuracy of the final review. Experiments demonstrate that MARP outperforms single LLM reviews, suggesting its potential to assist and improve the peer review process in scientific research.\n",

This level of detail is necessary for other researchers to replicate the results and to understand the limitations of the proposed method. Without this information, the results are difficult to interpret and the claims of the paper are less convincing.\n",

      "To address the limitations of the evaluation, the authors should conduct experiments on a larger and more diverse dataset of scientific papers. The current evaluation on a small, manually selected sample of 100 papers is insufficient to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method. The authors should consider using publicly available datasets of scientific papers, such as the ACL Anthology or the arXiv database, to evaluate the performance of MARP on a broader range of research areas and paper types. Additionally, the authors should explore different evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the reviews generated by MARP. For example, they could measure the coherence, consistency, and relevance of the reviews, as well as the accuracy of the final decision. A more comprehensive evaluation would provide a more robust assessment of the method's strengths and weaknesses.\n",

They should also explore methods for mitigating these biases, such as using debiasing techniques or incorporating fairness constraints into the optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the authors should compare the performance of MARP with other state-of-the-art methods for automated peer review or paper evaluation. This comparison would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's strengths and weaknesses and would help to establish its position in the field.

      "1. The paper lacks a comparison with other multi-agent frameworks, such as those based on game theory or distributed consensus algorithms. Specifically, the paper does not explore how MARP's performance compares to established methods for achieving convergence and optimality in multi-agent systems. For example, how does MARP's iterative refinement process compare to the convergence properties of algorithms like fictitious play or replicator dynamics, which are commonly used in game-theoretic settings? Furthermore, the paper does not discuss the potential for using techniques from distributed consensus algorithms, such as average consensus or distributed optimization, to improve the efficiency and robustness of the multi-agent review process.\n",
      "2. The paper does not address the computational cost of the proposed method, especially when scaling to a large number of agents or iterations. The paper should include a detailed analysis of the time and memory complexity of the MARP algorithm, including the cost of LLM inference, feedback generation, and iterative refinement. It is unclear how the computational cost scales with the number of agents, the length of the papers, and the number of iterations. This is a critical consideration for practical applications of the method, especially in scenarios with a large volume of submissions.\n",
      "3. The paper does not discuss the potential for bias in the reward model or how it might affect the fairness of the review process. The reward model, which is fine-tuned using an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm, could introduce biases if the training data is not representative or if the optimization process amplifies existing biases. The paper should include an analysis of the potential sources of bias in the reward model and how these biases might affect the fairness of the review process. For example, the paper should investigate whether the reward model favors certain writing styles, research topics, or demographic groups.\n",

      "The paper should include a more thorough comparison with existing multi-agent frameworks. Specifically, the authors should explore how MARP's performance compares to established methods for achieving convergence and optimality in multi-agent systems.

For example, the authors could investigate how algorithms like fictitious play or replicator dynamics perform in the context of multi-agent review. Furthermore, the authors should consider the potential for using techniques from distributed consensus algorithms, such as average consensus or distributed optimization, to improve the efficiency and robustness of the multi-agent review process.

This analysis should be supported by empirical results, demonstrating the practical feasibility of the method for different scales of application. Furthermore, the authors should discuss potential strategies for reducing the computational cost, such as using more efficient LLM inference techniques or optimizing the iterative refinement process. This would make the method more practical for real-world applications.\n",

      "* **Writing Quality (Reviewer 1):**  Reviewer 1's assessment of the writing quality is valid. While the technical sections are generally understandable, the paper does suffer from instances of long and complex sentences, particularly in the introductory and descriptive parts. This impacts readability.\n",
      "* **Methodological Details (Reviewer 1):** Reviewer 1's criticism regarding the lack of technical details in the method section is also valid. The paper provides a high-level overview but lacks specific implementation details for crucial components like feedback integration, communication protocols, review evaluation criteria, and the specifics of the preference optimization algorithm. This hinders reproducibility and a full understanding of the method.\n",
      "* **Experimental Justification and Evaluation (Reviewer 1):** Reviewer 1's concerns about the experimental setup and evaluation are valid. The paper lacks explicit justifications for the choice of datasets and baselines. The evaluation metrics are limited, and there's no comparison to human reviewers or extensive testing for robustness and generalizability. This limits the ability to fully assess the effectiveness and generalizability of MARP.\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces Multi-Agent Review (MARP), a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate the traditional peer review process. The core idea is to employ multiple LLMs as independent reviewers, each providing feedback on a given research paper. These agents then iteratively refine their reviews by exchanging feedback, ultimately converging on a consensus conclusion. The authors also incorporate an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm to fine-tune a reward model, aiming to enhance the accuracy of the final review. The experimental results, conducted on a dataset of papers from NeurIPS 2021, suggest that MARP outperforms single LLM reviews, such as those generated by ChatGPT-3.5, in terms of predicting acceptance decisions. The authors propose that MARP could assist and improve the peer review process in scientific research by providing a more efficient and potentially less biased alternative to traditional methods. The methodology involves a controller agent that manages the review process, and reviewer agents that are configured with specific roles and prompts to evaluate the paper from different perspectives. The iterative feedback mechanism allows the agents to refine their evaluations based on the feedback received from other agents. The reward model is trained to assess the quality of the reviews, guiding the iterative refinement process. The paper's significance lies in its attempt to automate and improve the peer review process using LLMs, which could have implications for the efficiency and objectivity of scientific evaluation. However, the paper also has several limitations that need to be addressed to fully realize its potential.\n",

      "The core strength of this paper lies in its innovative application of multi-agent systems, specifically using multiple LLMs, to simulate the peer review process. This approach, which I've verified through the paper's method section, is a novel way to mimic the diverse perspectives and iterative refinement inherent in human peer review. The idea of having multiple LLMs independently review a paper and then provide feedback to each other is a creative and promising approach to automating this critical aspect of scientific research. The paper also introduces an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm to fine-tune a reward model, which is designed to enhance the accuracy of the final review. This iterative process, where the agents refine their understanding of the material through feedback, is a key strength of the proposed method. The authors' attempt to use LLMs to assist the review process could potentially improve the quality and efficiency of scientific peer review, which is a significant contribution. The use of different roles for the reviewer agents, such as a statistician, a domain expert, and a methodologist, is another strength, as it allows the system to evaluate the paper from multiple perspectives. The mathematical formulation of the consensus conclusion, while simple, provides a clear and concise way to aggregate the individual reviews. The paper's focus on using LLMs to address a real-world problem, such as the limitations of traditional peer review, is also commendable. The authors have identified a relevant and important problem and proposed a novel solution that has the potential to impact the way scientific research is evaluated. The paper's exploration of using LLMs to simulate human-like review processes is a valuable contribution to the field of AI in scientific discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "After a thorough examination of the paper, I've identified several significant weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the writing quality, while generally understandable, suffers from instances of long and complex sentences, particularly in the introductory and descriptive sections. For example, the introduction contains sentences like, 'Building upon the foundation of deep learning and transformer architectures, large language models (LLMs) have undergone remarkable evolution. With extensive training data and computational power, LLMs have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human language, leading to widespread applications across various domains.' This lack of conciseness and clarity makes the paper less accessible and can hinder the reader's understanding. This is a high-confidence issue, as it is directly observable in the text. Second, the method section lacks crucial technical details, making it difficult to fully understand and reproduce the proposed method. The description of the multi-agent review process is vague, particularly regarding the feedback integration function, denoted as `f`. The paper states that 'R_j^{t+1} = f(R_j^t, F_{ij}^t) = R_j^t + \\sum_{i \\ne j} \\mathcal{M}_{R_j}(F_{ij}^t; \\text{integrate\\_feedback})', but the exact implementation of the `integrate_feedback` process is not explicitly defined. Similarly, the communication protocols between agents are not clearly specified, and the criteria for evaluating the reviews are not formally defined. The iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm is also insufficiently described, with a lack of detail regarding the loss function and the nature of the preference labels. This lack of specificity is a high-confidence issue, as it directly impacts the reproducibility of the method. Third, the experimental setup is not well-justified, and the evaluation is limited. The paper uses papers from NeurIPS 2021, but the rationale for choosing this specific year is not explicitly stated. The comparison is primarily against ChatGPT-3.5, without a clear justification for this choice over other potential baselines. The evaluation metric is limited to the accuracy of acceptance/rejection prediction, and there is no comparison to human reviewers. Furthermore, the experiments are conducted on a small, manually selected sample of 100 papers, which may not be representative of the broader range of scientific research. This lack of justification and limited evaluation is a high-confidence issue, as it directly impacts the validity of the experimental results. Fourth, the discussion of related work is insufficient. While the paper mentions some existing approaches, it lacks a detailed comparison of MARP to these methods. The paper does not adequately contextualize MARP within the broader landscape of multi-agent systems, game theory, or distributed consensus algorithms. The discussion of limitations and future directions is also limited, lacking specific avenues for future research. This is a high-confidence issue, as it limits the understanding of MARP's novelty and potential advantages/disadvantages. Fifth, the paper does not provide access to the source code, which significantly hinders the reproducibility of the experiments and the verification of the results. This is a high-confidence issue, as the absence of code directly impacts the ability of other researchers to replicate and build upon this work. Sixth, the paper does not address the potential biases that may be present in the LLMs used for the review process. LLMs are known to reflect biases present in their training data, which could affect the fairness and objectivity of the reviews. The paper also lacks a discussion of potential biases in the reward model, which is fine-tuned using an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm. This is a high-confidence issue, as the absence of bias analysis is a significant oversight. Finally, the paper does not include a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, especially when scaling to a large number of agents or iterations. This is a high-confidence issue, as the lack of computational cost analysis is a significant limitation for assessing the practicality of MARP. These weaknesses, taken together, significantly impact the overall quality and credibility of the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should significantly revise the writing for clarity and conciseness. This includes breaking down long and complex sentences, particularly in the introductory and descriptive sections. The authors should also ensure that all technical terms are clearly defined and that the language is precise and unambiguous. Second, the method section needs to be significantly expanded to include a detailed description of the multi-agent review process. This should include a precise definition of the feedback integration function, the communication protocols between agents, and the criteria for evaluating the reviews. The authors should provide a clear and precise definition of the iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm, including the mathematical formulation and the implementation details. Third, the experimental setup needs to be more rigorously justified. The authors should provide a clear rationale for the choice of datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The evaluation should be expanded to include more comprehensive metrics, such as the quality of the generated feedback, the diversity of perspectives, and the level of agreement among agents. The authors should also consider comparing the proposed method to a wider range of baselines, including human reviewers and other state-of-the-art automated peer review methods. The experiments should also be conducted on a larger and more diverse dataset of scientific papers to ensure the generalizability of the results. Fourth, the discussion of related work should be significantly expanded to include a detailed comparison of MARP to existing approaches, including those based on game theory and distributed consensus algorithms. The authors should also discuss the limitations of the proposed method and suggest specific avenues for future research. Fifth, the authors should make the source code available to the community to allow for independent verification and to facilitate further research in this area. This is a critical step for ensuring the reproducibility of the results. Sixth, the authors should include a detailed discussion of the potential biases that may be present in the LLMs used for the review process and in the reward model. The authors should investigate the potential for biases related to the authors' gender, institution, or research area. They should also explore methods for mitigating these biases, such as using debiasing techniques or incorporating fairness constraints into the optimization algorithm. Finally, the authors should include a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, including the time and memory complexity of the MARP algorithm. The authors should also investigate how the computational cost scales with the number of agents, the length of the papers, and the number of iterations. These improvements would significantly strengthen the paper and make a more meaningful contribution to the field.\n",

First, how does the proposed MARP method compare to other multi-agent frameworks, such as those based on game theory or distributed consensus algorithms? I'm particularly interested in understanding how MARP's iterative refinement process compares to the convergence properties of algorithms like fictitious play or replicator dynamics. Second, what is the computational cost of the proposed method, especially when scaling to a large number of agents or iterations? I'd like to see a detailed analysis of the time and memory complexity of the MARP algorithm, including the cost of LLM inference, feedback generation, and iterative refinement. Third, how does the reward model address potential biases, and how might these biases affect the fairness of the review process? I'm curious about the specific techniques used to mitigate bias in the reward model and how the authors ensure that the model does not favor certain writing styles, research topics, or demographic groups. Fourth, how does the choice of LLM affect the performance of the proposed method? Would using a more advanced LLM lead to better results? I'm interested in understanding the sensitivity of MARP to the specific LLM used and whether there are any specific LLMs that are better suited for this task. Fifth, how does the number of agents affect the performance of the proposed method? Is there an optimal number of agents that balances performance and computational cost? I'd like to see a more detailed analysis of the impact of the number of agents on the quality of the reviews and the overall efficiency of the process. Sixth, what measures have been taken to ensure the fairness and objectivity of the reviews generated by MARP, especially considering the potential biases in LLMs? I'm interested in understanding the specific steps taken to mitigate bias and ensure that the reviews are fair and objective. Finally, how does the iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm specifically contribute to the improvement of review quality, and what are the limitations of this approach? I'd like to see a more detailed explanation of the algorithm and its limitations, as well as a discussion of alternative approaches that could be used to improve the quality of the reviews.\n",

For example, including papers from fields such as biology, chemistry, or physics, which have different conventions and standards than AI/ML, would be beneficial. Furthermore, the evaluation should not only focus on the preference of reviews but also on the accuracy of the content, ensuring that the generated reviews correctly identify the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, and do not introduce factual errors or misinterpretations. A more rigorous evaluation of the review content is needed to ensure that RALS is not just generating fluent text but also providing meaningful and accurate feedback.\n",

      "To address the concern that RALS might prioritize form over substance, the authors should investigate methods to explicitly guide the LLM to focus on the scientific validity and novelty of the research. This could involve incorporating specific prompts or constraints that encourage the model to critically evaluate the methodology, results, and conclusions, rather than just focusing on the presentation. For example, the prompt could be modified to include specific questions about the experimental design, the statistical analysis, and the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the authors could explore techniques to evaluate the depth of the review, such as measuring the number of unique insights or the level of critical analysis provided. This would help to ensure that RALS is not just generating superficial reviews that focus on style rather than substance. The authors should also consider comparing the reviews generated by RALS with those of human experts to identify any systematic differences in the focus and content of the reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the authors need to address the potential for biases in the training data to affect the review process. This could involve conducting a thorough analysis of the training data to identify any potential biases and implementing techniques to mitigate their impact. For example, the authors could use debiasing techniques to reduce the model's preference for certain methodologies or institutions. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate the fairness of the review process by analyzing the distribution of scores across different demographic groups or research areas. This would help to ensure that RALS is not inadvertently introducing biases that could skew the review outcomes and undermine the fairness of the scientific validation process. The authors should also consider the ethical implications of using automated systems for peer review and ensure that the system is transparent and accountable.\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces RALS (Referees in AI for Scientific Peer Searer Review), an innovative system designed to automate the scientific peer review process using large language models (LLMs). The core idea behind RALS is to simulate the traditional peer review workflow through a four-stage process: reading, analyzing, launching criticisms, and self-refining. In the reading stage, the LLM processes the research paper, summarizing its key points and arguments. The analyzing stage involves a deeper examination of the paper's methodology, results, and conclusions, identifying both strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, the launching criticisms stage enables the LLM to articulate detailed and specific critiques of the paper's content. Finally, the self-refining stage allows the LLM to iteratively improve its own review by reflecting on its previous outputs and making necessary adjustments. The authors evaluate RALS on a dataset of 169 reviewed AI/ML papers from NeurIPS, ICML, and ACL, demonstrating that RALS can generate high-quality reviews that are often preferred over human reviews by both domain experts and the general public. The authors also explore the potential of RALS as a reward model for scientific discovery, suggesting that it could be used to automate scientific quality control. The paper's findings suggest that LLMs can be effectively used to automate aspects of the peer review process, potentially accelerating scientific validation and discovery. However, the authors acknowledge that further refinement and evaluation are needed to ensure that RALS complements human review without undermining the rigor of scientific validation. The paper's contribution lies in its novel approach to automating peer review and its exploration of the potential for LLMs to revolutionize scientific quality control and discovery. The authors present a compelling case for the feasibility of using LLMs to automate peer review, while also acknowledging the limitations and challenges that need to be addressed before such systems can be widely adopted.\n",

      "The primary strength of this paper lies in its innovative approach to automating scientific peer review using large language models. The RALS system, with its four-stage process, effectively simulates the key steps of traditional peer review, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to handle complex tasks like evaluating scientific research. The paper's empirical findings, based on a dataset of 169 reviewed AI/ML papers, are compelling. The fact that RALS-generated reviews are often preferred over human reviews by both domain experts and the general public suggests that the system is not only feasible but also capable of producing high-quality feedback. This is a significant achievement, as it indicates that LLMs can potentially assist in the peer review process, reducing the burden on human reviewers and accelerating the pace of scientific validation. Furthermore, the paper's exploration of RALS as a reward model for scientific discovery is a novel and promising direction. The idea that RALS could be used to automate scientific quality control and potentially even guide research efforts is intriguing and warrants further investigation. The authors' willingness to acknowledge the limitations of their work and to suggest areas for future research is also commendable. This balanced approach enhances the credibility of the paper and encourages further exploration of the potential of LLMs in scientific peer review. The paper's clear and concise writing style also contributes to its strengths, making it accessible to a broad audience. The authors effectively communicate the core concepts and findings, ensuring that the paper's contributions are readily understood. Overall, the paper presents a well-executed study with significant implications for the future of scientific peer review.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "While the paper presents a compelling case for the use of LLMs in automating peer review, several weaknesses need to be addressed. First, the study's evaluation is limited by its dataset, which consists solely of AI/ML papers from three specific conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, and ACL). This narrow focus raises concerns about the generalizability of RALS to other scientific disciplines with different writing styles, methodologies, and evaluation metrics. As the paper itself acknowledges, the performance of RALS on papers from fields such as biology, chemistry, or physics, which often have different conventions and standards than AI/ML, is unknown. This limitation is significant because it restricts the applicability of the findings and raises questions about the robustness of RALS in diverse scientific contexts. Second, there is a risk that RALS might prioritize form over substance in its reviews. While the method description mentions evaluating methodology, results, and conclusions, the lack of detailed prompt analysis and specific metrics for critical evaluation leaves room for concern that the system might focus more on the style and structure of the paper rather than the novelty and validity of the research. This is a critical issue because it could lead to reviews that are superficial and fail to identify fundamental flaws in the science. The paper does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that RALS is capable of deeply engaging with the scientific content of the papers it reviews. Third, the paper does not fully address how RALS would handle highly specialized or interdisciplinary research, where nuanced understanding and domain-specific knowledge are crucial for a thorough review. The method relies on the LLM's pre-existing knowledge and the information contained within the paper itself, without any explicit mechanism for incorporating external domain-specific knowledge or handling highly specialized terminology. This is a significant limitation because it suggests that RALS may struggle to provide meaningful reviews for research that falls outside of the general AI/ML domain. Fourth, the paper does not adequately address the potential for biases in the training data to affect the review process. The paper mentions using pre-trained LLMs (GPT-4, Qwen2.5-72B, Mistral) but does not discuss any specific debiasing techniques applied during training or fine-tuning. The evaluation also lacks specific metrics or analyses to detect or quantify potential biases. This is a critical oversight because it raises concerns about the fairness and objectivity of RALS-generated reviews. The absence of bias analysis makes it difficult to ensure that RALS is not inadvertently introducing biases that could skew the review outcomes and undermine the fairness of the scientific validation process. Fifth, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the limitations of RALS or potential challenges in implementing it in real-world scenarios. For example, the paper does not discuss how RALS would handle papers that are outside of its training distribution, what the computational costs of running RALS on a large scale would be, or how RALS would handle cases where the review process is adversarial or strategic. This lack of analysis is a significant gap in understanding the practical applicability of RALS. Finally, the paper does not compare RALS to other existing approaches for automating scientific peer review, such as machine learning models that predict paper quality based on features like citation counts or author reputation, or approaches that use natural language processing to identify fraudulent papers. This lack of comparison makes it difficult to assess the relative contribution and advantages of RALS. The paper also fails to discuss the ethical implications of using LLMs to automate scientific peer review, such as the impact on the fairness and transparency of the review process, or how RALS would handle cases where the review process is biased or discriminatory. This lack of ethical consideration is a significant oversight, given the potential societal impact of automated peer review systems. These weaknesses, taken together, highlight the need for further research and refinement of RALS before it can be widely adopted.\n",

      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, several concrete improvements can be made. First, the authors should expand their evaluation to include a more diverse set of papers, encompassing different scientific disciplines and publication venues. This would provide a more robust assessment of RALS's generalizability and identify potential limitations in its ability to handle varied research topics and methodologies. For example, including papers from fields such as biology, chemistry, or physics, which have different conventions and standards than AI/ML, would be beneficial. Furthermore, the evaluation should not only focus on the preference of reviews but also on the accuracy of the content, ensuring that the generated reviews correctly identify the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, and do not introduce factual errors or misinterpretations. A more rigorous evaluation of the review content is needed to ensure that RALS is not just generating fluent text but also providing meaningful and accurate feedback. Second, to address the concern that RALS might prioritize form over substance, the authors should investigate methods to explicitly guide the LLM to focus on the scientific validity and novelty of the research. This could involve incorporating specific prompts or constraints that encourage the model to critically evaluate the methodology, results, and conclusions, rather than just focusing on the presentation. For example, the prompt could be modified to include specific questions about the experimental design, the statistical analysis, and the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the authors could explore techniques to evaluate the depth of the review, such as measuring the number of unique insights or the level of critical analysis provided. This would help to ensure that RALS is not just generating superficial reviews that focus on style rather than substance. The authors should also consider comparing the reviews generated by RALS with those of human experts to identify any systematic differences in the focus and content of the reviews. Third, the authors need to address the potential for biases in the training data to affect the review process. This could involve conducting a thorough analysis of the training data to identify any potential biases and implementing techniques to mitigate their impact. For example, the authors could use debiasing techniques to reduce the model's preference for certain methodologies or institutions. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate the fairness of the review process by analyzing the distribution of scores across different demographic groups or research areas. This would help to ensure that RALS is not inadvertently introducing biases that could skew the review outcomes and undermine the fairness of the scientific validation process. The authors should also consider the ethical implications of using automated systems for peer review and ensure that the system is transparent and accountable. Fourth, the authors should include a more thorough analysis of RALS's limitations, particularly regarding its robustness to out-of-distribution papers. The current evaluation focuses on AI/ML papers, but it is unclear how RALS would perform on papers from other fields with different writing styles, methodologies, and evaluation metrics. For example, how would RALS handle a paper from theoretical physics that relies heavily on mathematical proofs, or a paper from biology that presents a novel experimental technique? The authors should consider evaluating RALS on a more diverse dataset that includes papers from different scientific disciplines. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the computational costs associated with running RALS, including the time and resources required for each stage of the review process. This is important for assessing the scalability of the approach. The authors should also explore how RALS handles adversarial or strategic reviews, where reviewers may intentionally provide misleading or unfair feedback. This could involve testing RALS on datasets that include examples of such reviews and analyzing its ability to detect and mitigate them. Fifth, to better contextualize the contribution of RALS, the paper should include a more detailed comparison to existing approaches for automating scientific peer review. While the paper mentions some related work, it does not provide a thorough analysis of how RALS compares to these methods in terms of performance, efficiency, and applicability. For example, how does RALS compare to machine learning models that predict paper quality based on features such as citation counts or author reputation? How does RALS compare to approaches that use natural language processing to identify fraudulent papers? A more detailed comparison would help to clarify the unique advantages and limitations of RALS. The authors should also discuss the potential for combining RALS with other approaches to create a more robust and comprehensive system for automating scientific peer review. Finally, the paper should address the ethical implications of using LLMs to automate scientific peer review. The authors should discuss how RALS impacts the fairness and transparency of the review process. For example, how does RALS ensure that reviews are not biased against certain groups or research areas? How does RALS handle cases where the review process is discriminatory? The authors should also discuss the potential for misuse of RALS, such as using it to generate fake reviews or to manipulate the review process. The paper should include a discussion of the safeguards that are in place to prevent such misuse. Furthermore, the authors should consider the impact of RALS on the role of human reviewers and the potential for RALS to replace human reviewers in the future. A thorough discussion of these ethical considerations is essential for ensuring that RALS is used responsibly and ethically.\n",

      "The paper lacks novelty since the authors only consider the AI-related domain. The authors should extend their analysis to other domains, such as NLP, CV, and recommendation systems. The authors should also compare their methods with the latest approaches to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed method. However, the authors only use different LLMs. The authors should include more experiments to validate the effectiveness of their proposed method, such as different selection of papers.

      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors should significantly broaden the scope of their experimental evaluation. Focusing solely on AI-related papers limits the generalizability of their findings. To address this, they should include datasets from diverse fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and recommendation systems. This would involve not only using papers from these domains but also adapting their evaluation metrics to account for the specific nuances of each field. For example, the criteria for a good review in CV might emphasize the clarity of experimental setup and the novelty of the visual task, while in NLP, the focus might be more on the theoretical soundness and the quality of the textual data. Furthermore, the authors should justify their choice of datasets and provide a detailed analysis of how the performance of AIRA varies across these different domains. This would provide a more robust assessment of the system's capabilities and limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to expanding the domain coverage, the authors need to conduct a more thorough comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods. Simply comparing different LLMs is insufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed approach. They should include a comparison with recent peer review methods, such as those that use advanced ranking algorithms or collaborative filtering techniques. This would involve not only implementing these methods but also adapting them to the task of review generation. For example, they could explore how methods that leverage reviewer expertise or past review history perform in comparison to AIRA. Furthermore, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach relative to these baselines, highlighting the specific scenarios where AIRA excels and where it falls short. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the value of their contribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the authors should significantly improve the presentation of their work. The paper lacks clarity and detail, making it difficult to fully understand the proposed method and the experimental setup. They should provide a more detailed description of the AIRA system, including the specific algorithms used for review generation and the prompt engineering techniques employed. Furthermore, they should provide a more thorough description of the experimental setup, including the specific datasets used, the evaluation metrics, and the statistical significance of their results. The authors should also include more ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components of their system. For example, they could explore how the performance of AIRA changes when different prompts are used or when different LLMs are used. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the system's behavior and allow for more informed conclusions.\n",

How does the note-taking agent organize and store the identified issues? What is the architecture of the feedback summarization agent, and how does it ensure that the summary is comprehensive and accurate? Furthermore, the paper should detail the prompt engineering strategies used for each agent, including examples of the prompts used and the rationale behind their design. The evaluation process also needs more clarity. The authors should specify the metrics used to assess the performance of each agent individually, as well as the overall performance of the AIRA system.

For example, in which specific areas does AIRA outperform human reviewers, and where does it fall short? The paper should also analyze the types of errors made by AIRA, categorizing them into specific error types such as factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or misunderstandings of the paper's methodology. This analysis should be accompanied by concrete examples of each error type, illustrating the nature of the mistakes made by AIRA. Furthermore, the paper should explore the reasons behind these errors, providing insights into the limitations of the current implementation.

The paper should also discuss the potential for AIRA to be used inappropriately, such as generating fake reviews or manipulating the review process. The authors should propose safeguards to prevent such misuse, including mechanisms for detecting and mitigating bias, as well as ensuring the transparency and accountability of the review process.

      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper should delve deeper into the specific challenges AIRA faces when evaluating technically complex papers. For instance, the system's ability to understand nuanced mathematical arguments or identify subtle flaws in algorithmic design needs further investigation. The current evaluation seems to focus on more general aspects of review quality, but a more granular analysis of AIRA's performance on papers with high technical depth would be beneficial. This could involve categorizing papers based on their technical complexity and analyzing AIRA's performance across these categories. Furthermore, the paper should explore methods to improve AIRA's ability to handle such complex scenarios, perhaps by incorporating techniques like symbolic reasoning or formal verification into the system's architecture. This would not only enhance the system's capabilities but also provide a more comprehensive understanding of its limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the limitation of the single case study, the authors should consider expanding their evaluation to include a more diverse set of conferences and journals. This would help to assess the generalizability of AIRA's performance across different academic communities and review cultures. For example, comparing AIRA's performance on conferences with different review formats (e.g., short papers, long papers, workshops) or different levels of technical specialization would provide valuable insights. Additionally, the authors could explore the impact of different review guidelines and expectations on AIRA's performance. This would involve adapting AIRA to different review formats and guidelines and evaluating its performance in these new contexts. Such an analysis would help to determine the robustness of AIRA and its potential for broader adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the paper needs a more thorough investigation into the potential biases that may be present in the training data and the alignment techniques used. The authors should analyze the demographics and backgrounds of the human reviewers whose reviews were used for training, as well as the types of papers they reviewed. This analysis could reveal potential biases related to specific research areas, methodologies, or demographic groups. Furthermore, the authors should explore the impact of different alignment techniques on the fairness and objectivity of AIRA's reviews. This could involve comparing different alignment methods and evaluating their impact on the diversity and inclusivity of the generated reviews. The authors should also consider using techniques like adversarial training to mitigate potential biases and ensure that AIRA provides fair and objective reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Questions\n",
      "\n",
      "- How does AIRA handle papers that are outside of its training data or that challenge established paradigms?\n",
      "- What measures are in place to ensure the honesty and integrity of AI reviewers, and how can they be prevented from gaming the evaluation process?\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces the AI Reviewer Agent (AIRA), a system designed to simulate human-AI collaboration in the scientific peer review process. The authors propose AIRA as a means to address the challenges of reviewer fatigue and potential biases in the traditional peer review system, which has been strained by the increasing volume of research papers, particularly in the field of deep learning. AIRA operates through a multi-agent framework consisting of a reading agent, a note-taking agent, a feedback summarization agent, and a review generating agent. These agents work sequentially, processing the paper and generating a review. The authors also introduce the AI Review Assessment (AIRA) benchmark, a dataset of over 640 reviews of 94 AI papers from the ICML 2024 conference, which includes both human and AI-generated reviews. This benchmark is intended to facilitate the evaluation of AI reviewer agents. The evaluation process involves a multi-round assessment, where AI-generated reviews are compared to human reviews using a multiple-choice questionnaire. The results indicate that AI reviews improve significantly between rounds, and in some cases, are rated higher than human reviews, particularly by authors. The authors also find that AI reviews tend to be more detailed and specific. The paper's core contribution lies in the introduction of AIRA and the AIRA benchmark, which provides a valuable resource for the research community. The study highlights the potential of AI to assist in the peer review process, demonstrating that AI reviewers can generate high-quality reviews and improve over time. However, the paper also acknowledges the limitations of AIRA, particularly in understanding complex technical details and providing feedback on mathematical accuracy. The authors also note the potential for AI reviewers to introduce biases and the need for further research in this area. Overall, this paper presents a significant step towards automating the peer review process, offering a novel approach to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific peer review.\n",

      "I find several strengths in this paper, primarily in its novel approach to addressing a significant challenge in the academic community. The introduction of the AI Reviewer Agent (AIRA) is a notable contribution, as it attempts to simulate human-AI collaboration in the peer review process. This is a timely and relevant problem, given the increasing volume of research papers and the limitations of the traditional peer review system. The multi-agent framework, consisting of reading, note-taking, feedback summarization, and review generating agents, is a well-structured approach that mimics the human review process. The use of a modular system allows for flexibility and adaptability, which is a strength. The paper also contributes a valuable dataset of over 640 reviews of 94 AI papers from the ICML 2024 conference. This dataset, which includes both human and AI-generated reviews, is a significant resource for the research community and can facilitate further studies on AI-assisted peer review. The authors' decision to make this dataset publicly available is commendable and will undoubtedly benefit other researchers in the field. The multi-round evaluation is another strength of the paper. By comparing AI-generated reviews with human reviews over multiple rounds, the authors demonstrate the potential for AI reviewers to improve over time. This is an important finding, as it suggests that AI reviewers can learn from their mistakes and generate better reviews with more experience. The results of the human evaluation, where the best AI reviews are rated higher than the worst human reviews, are also noteworthy. This finding suggests that AI reviewers have the potential to generate high-quality reviews that are on par with or even better than human reviews. The authors also highlight the fact that AI reviews tend to be more detailed and specific, which is a positive aspect of their approach. Finally, the paper's focus on a practical application of AI in a real-world scenario is a strength. The authors are not just proposing a theoretical concept but are actually implementing and evaluating a system that could potentially improve the peer review process. This practical focus makes the paper more relevant and impactful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, while the paper describes the methodology, it lacks a detailed explanation of the specific algorithms and techniques used to implement each of the four agents. The paper mentions the use of prompts, but the exact nature of these prompts and the rationale behind their design are not fully elaborated. For example, the paper states that the reading agent extracts key concepts, methodologies, and results, but it doesn't specify the natural language processing models used or how the note-taking agent organizes and stores the identified issues. Similarly, the feedback summarization agent's architecture and the mechanisms used to ensure comprehensive and accurate summaries are not detailed. This lack of specificity makes it difficult to fully understand the inner workings of AIRA and hinders the reproducibility of the results. This is a significant limitation, as it prevents other researchers from building upon the authors' work. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's method section lacks the necessary detail to fully understand the implementation of each agent. Second, the paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the results. While the paper presents some comparisons between AI and human reviews, a deeper dive into the specific strengths and weaknesses of AIRA in different scenarios is needed. The paper mentions that AIRA sometimes struggles to understand complex technical details and may introduce factual errors, but it doesn't provide a granular analysis of the types of errors made by AIRA. For example, the paper notes that the model may not fully grasp complex mathematical concepts and proofs, but it doesn't provide specific examples of these errors or analyze the underlying reasons. Furthermore, the paper's comparison across different academic communities is limited to high-level observations. A more detailed analysis of AIRA's performance across different domains, highlighting the specific areas where it excels and where it falls short, is needed. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's analysis section lacks the depth and granularity needed to fully understand the performance of AIRA. Third, the paper does not adequately address the potential biases and ethical considerations of using AI in the peer review process. While the paper acknowledges the potential for AI reviewers to game the evaluation process, it doesn't delve into broader ethical concerns such as fairness, transparency, and the impact on human reviewers. The paper does not discuss how AIRA handles papers from underrepresented groups or those that challenge established paradigms. The potential for AIRA to be used inappropriately, such as generating fake reviews or manipulating the review process, is also not fully explored. The paper lacks a discussion of safeguards to prevent such misuse, including mechanisms for detecting and mitigating bias, as well as ensuring the transparency and accountability of the review process. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's discussion of ethical considerations is limited and does not address the broader implications of using AI in peer review. Fourth, the evaluation is limited to a single case study (ICML 2024), which may not be representative of other conferences or journals. The paper's reliance on data from a single conference limits the generalizability of the findings. The characteristics of peer review might vary across different venues, and the paper does not explore how AIRA would perform in different contexts. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper explicitly states that the paper selection is from ICML 2024, and the lack of evaluation on other datasets limits the generalizability of the findings. Finally, the paper does not fully explore the potential biases that may be introduced by the training data or the alignment techniques used. The paper mentions using publicly available reviews from ICML 2024 for human reviews and LoRA for alignment, but it doesn't analyze how these choices might introduce biases into the AI-generated reviews. The paper does not discuss the demographics and backgrounds of the human reviewers whose reviews were used for training, nor does it explore the impact of different alignment techniques on the fairness and objectivity of AIRA's reviews. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper lacks a detailed investigation into the potential biases stemming from the training data and alignment techniques used.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the AI Reviewer Agent (AIRA) development process. Specifically, they should elaborate on the specific algorithms and techniques used to implement each of the four agents. For example, they should specify the natural language processing models used for the reading agent to extract key concepts, methodologies, and results. They should also explain how the note-taking agent organizes and stores the identified issues, and what the architecture of the feedback summarization agent is. Furthermore, the paper should detail the prompt engineering strategies used for each agent, including examples of the prompts used and the rationale behind their design. This would significantly enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the work. Second, the authors should provide a more in-depth analysis of the results. This should include a more granular analysis of the types of errors made by AIRA, categorizing them into specific error types such as factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or misunderstandings of the paper's methodology. This analysis should be accompanied by concrete examples of each error type, illustrating the nature of the mistakes made by AIRA. Furthermore, the paper should explore the reasons behind these errors, providing insights into the limitations of the current implementation. The authors should also investigate the impact of different LLMs and alignment techniques on the quality of the generated reviews, providing a more detailed analysis of the factors that influence AIRA's performance. Third, the paper needs to address the ethical implications of using AI in the peer review process. The authors should discuss the potential biases that may be introduced by the training data or the algorithms used in AIRA. For example, they should analyze the demographics and backgrounds of the human reviewers whose reviews were used for training, as well as the types of papers they reviewed. This analysis could reveal potential biases related to specific research areas, methodologies, or demographic groups. Furthermore, the authors should explore the impact of different alignment techniques on the fairness and objectivity of AIRA's reviews. The authors should also propose safeguards to prevent the misuse of AIRA, including mechanisms for detecting and mitigating bias, as well as ensuring the transparency and accountability of the review process. The paper should also discuss the potential impact of AIRA on the roles and responsibilities of human reviewers, and how the human-AI collaboration can be optimized to ensure the integrity and fairness of the peer review process. Fourth, to address the limitation of the single case study, the authors should consider expanding their evaluation to include a more diverse set of conferences and journals. This would help to assess the generalizability of AIRA's performance across different academic communities and review cultures. For example, comparing AIRA's performance on conferences with different review formats (e.g., short papers, long papers, workshops) or different levels of technical specialization would provide valuable insights. Additionally, the authors could explore the impact of different review guidelines and expectations on AIRA's performance. This would involve adapting AIRA to different review formats and guidelines and evaluating its performance in these new contexts. Finally, the authors should conduct a more thorough investigation into the potential biases that may be present in the training data and the alignment techniques used. This could involve comparing different alignment methods and evaluating their impact on the diversity and inclusivity of the generated reviews. The authors should also consider using techniques like adversarial training to mitigate potential biases and ensure that AIRA provides fair and objective reviews.\n",

      "This paper introduces a series of models called AIReviewer, AIReviewerStar, and AIReviewerPlus for automating the scientific peer review process using language models. The base AIReviewer model simulates traditional peer review through multi-turn interactions and iterative optimization. AIReviewerStar enhances review quality by aligning with human expert reviews using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). AIReviewerPlus further incorporates author feedback to optimize the review policy. The authors develop a framework and dataset to evaluate these models on tasks like paper state encoding, review criteria encoding, and review generation. Experiments show that AIReviewer can generate detailed and consistent reviews, while AIReviewerStar outperforms existing LLM-based review systems. AIReviewerPlus demonstrates potential for accelerating feedback loops between authors and reviewers. The work aims to improve quality and efficiency of scientific research by automating aspects of peer review.\n",

      "Overall, the paper lacks clarity and rigorous methodology. The training process for the models is unclear, and many of the technical terms (e.g. \"order-n reasoning\") are not properly defined. The experimental setup seems somewhat ad hoc, and many important details are missing. While the topic is interesting, the current draft needs significant improvements in clarity, rigor, and evaluation before it is ready for publication. The paper would benefit from a more systematic approach to evaluation, including comparison to human-generated reviews and established metrics. The lack of precise definitions for key concepts like \"order-n reasoning\" makes it difficult to assess the novelty and technical contribution. The absence of detailed information about the training data, including its size, composition, and preprocessing steps, further hinders the reproducibility and validity of the results. The evaluation metrics used are not standard in the field, making it hard to compare the proposed approach with existing methods or human performance. The paper also lacks a clear explanation of how the AIReviewerPlus model incorporates author feedback into the review policy optimization. The description of the iterative review process is vague, and it is unclear how the model handles multiple rounds of feedback. The paper would benefit from a more detailed explanation of the experimental setup, including the specific prompts used for each task and the hyperparameter settings for the models.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the paper, the authors should begin by providing clear and precise definitions for all technical terms, especially \"order-n reasoning.\" This term, central to the proposed approach, needs a formal definition that explains its relationship to first-order and second-order reasoning. The authors should also provide a detailed description of the training data, including its source, size, preprocessing steps, and any potential biases. This information is crucial for assessing the generalizability of the results. The paper should also include a more rigorous evaluation methodology, using standard metrics for text generation tasks, such as ROUGE, BLEU, or METEOR, in addition to the current metrics. Comparing the performance of the proposed models to human-generated reviews would also be beneficial to assess the quality of the automated reviews. The authors should also provide a detailed explanation of the training process for each model, including the specific loss functions, optimization algorithms, and hyperparameter settings. The experimental setup should be described in sufficient detail to allow for reproducibility, including the specific prompts used for each task and the evaluation protocol. \n",

      "Furthermore, the authors should clarify how AIReviewerPlus incorporates author feedback into the review policy optimization. A detailed description of the feedback mechanism, including the specific types of feedback considered and how they are used to update the model's parameters, is necessary. The authors should also explain how the model handles multiple rounds of feedback and how it ensures the consistency and coherence of the reviews. The paper would also benefit from a more systematic approach to evaluation, including a comparison of the performance of the models on different types of papers and review criteria. This would help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach and to guide future research. The authors should also discuss the limitations of their approach, including the potential for bias and the challenges of handling complex and nuanced review scenarios.

      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper should delve deeper into the limitations of the AIReviewer system, particularly concerning its ability to handle novel or highly specialized research areas. The authors should discuss the potential for bias in the training data to influence the AI-generated reviews, and propose methods to mitigate this risk. This could involve techniques such as data augmentation, bias detection algorithms, or incorporating human feedback into the training process. Furthermore, the paper should explore the sensitivity of the AIReviewer system to variations in input quality, such as different writing styles or levels of detail in the research papers. This could be addressed by incorporating techniques for robust text processing and normalization, or by training the system on a more diverse dataset. The authors should also consider the potential for adversarial attacks on the AIReviewer system, where malicious actors might try to manipulate the system to produce biased or unfair reviews, and propose countermeasures to prevent such attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the evaluation of AIReviewerStar and AIReviewerPlus, the paper should provide a more detailed explanation of the metrics used to assess review quality. This should include a discussion of how these metrics are calculated, and how they relate to the overall goal of improving the peer review process. The authors should also compare the performance of the AIReviewer systems to human-generated reviews, using the same metrics, to provide a baseline for comparison. This comparison should include an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the AI-generated reviews, and identify areas where further improvement is needed. The paper should also clarify how the reward function is designed to balance different aspects of review quality, such as thoroughness, objectivity, and constructiveness, and whether there are any trade-offs between these aspects. The authors should also discuss the potential for overfitting to the reward function, and propose methods to prevent this, such as regularization techniques or early stopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper should include a more comprehensive comparison with existing LLM-based review systems, going beyond the claim that AIReviewerStar outperforms them. This comparison should include a detailed analysis of the specific advantages and disadvantages of each approach, considering factors such as computational resources, scalability, and the ability to handle different types of research papers. The authors should also discuss the potential for the existing LLM-based systems to be fine-tuned or adapted to achieve similar performance, and what specific architectural or methodological choices of AIReviewerStar lead to its superior performance. This could involve a detailed analysis of the model architectures, training procedures, and reward functions used by each system. The paper should also address the potential for the existing LLM-based systems to be combined with the AIReviewer system to achieve even better performance, and what challenges might arise from such an integration.\n",

      "## Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel approach to automating the scientific peer review process using large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a system called AIReviewer, which is composed of three distinct components: AIReviewer, AIReviewerStar, and AIReviewerPlus. The core idea is to leverage the capabilities of LLMs to simulate and enhance different aspects of the peer review process. AIReviewer serves as the foundational model, designed to simulate the traditional peer review process through multi-turn interactions and iterative optimization. It employs a form of 'order-n' reasoning to analyze input data and generate a latent decision, which is then used to produce a review. AIReviewerStar builds upon this foundation by incorporating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the generated reviews with human expert reviews, aiming to improve the quality and relevance of the output. Finally, AIReviewerPlus further refines the process by incorporating author feedback into the review policy optimization, using a combination of reward modeling and DPO to update the model's parameters. The authors evaluate their system on the NeurIPS 2023 dataset, demonstrating that AIReviewer can generate detailed and consistent reviews, while AIReviewerStar outperforms existing LLM-based review systems. AIReviewerPlus shows promise in accelerating the feedback loop between reviewers and authors, suggesting a shift towards a more collaborative and iterative review process. The paper's overall contribution lies in its attempt to automate and enhance the peer review process, potentially leading to more efficient and effective scientific research. The authors present a framework and dataset to evaluate these models on tasks like paper state encoding, review criteria encoding, and review generation. The experimental results, while promising, also highlight areas where further development and refinement are needed. The work aims to improve quality and efficiency of scientific research by automating aspects of peer review, and the authors suggest that their work aligns with the broader goal of creating a unified knowledge market where machines can assume traditional human roles, thereby enhancing the scientific research process. However, the paper also acknowledges the limitations of the current system and the need for further research to address these issues.\n",

      "\n",
      "The paper's primary strength lies in its ambitious attempt to tackle the complex and time-consuming task of scientific peer review using large language models. The development of the AIReviewer system, with its three distinct components, represents a significant step towards automating various aspects of the review process. The idea of using LLMs to simulate traditional peer review, optimize review quality through preference learning, and incorporate author feedback is both novel and potentially impactful. The authors have clearly identified a critical need in the scientific community for more efficient and effective peer review processes, and their work makes a valuable contribution towards addressing this challenge. The paper is well-structured, and the authors clearly articulate their methodology and experimental setup. The inclusion of figures and tables aids in visualizing the concepts and results, further enhancing the paper's clarity. The use of the NeurIPS 2023 dataset provides a relevant and realistic context for evaluating the proposed system. The experimental results, while not without limitations, demonstrate the potential of the AIReviewer system to generate detailed and consistent reviews. The authors also show that AIReviewerStar outperforms existing LLM-based review systems, and AIReviewerPlus shows promise in accelerating the feedback loop between reviewers and authors. The paper's attempt to address the broader goal of creating a unified knowledge market where machines can assume traditional human roles is also a noteworthy contribution. The authors have clearly articulated their vision for the future of peer review and the role that AI can play in this process. The paper also introduces a framework and dataset to evaluate these models on tasks like paper state encoding, review criteria encoding, and review generation, which is a valuable contribution to the field. The authors have also made an effort to compare their system with other LLMs, which is a good step towards demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach. Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated and technically sound approach to automating scientific peer review, and the results, while preliminary, are promising.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the paper's strengths, several weaknesses significantly impact its overall validity and the confidence I have in its conclusions. A primary concern is the lack of clarity and rigor in the methodology, particularly regarding the training process for the AIReviewer models. While the paper mentions using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for AIReviewer, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for AIReviewerStar and AIReviewerPlus, it fails to provide specific implementation details. For instance, the paper does not specify the hyperparameter settings, optimization algorithms, or training epochs used for each model. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and assess the robustness of the proposed approach. The paper also introduces the concept of 'order-n' reasoning, but it does not provide a formal definition or explain how it is implemented within the model. This term, central to the proposed approach, remains vague and undefined, making it difficult to understand its technical contribution. The experimental setup also lacks crucial details. While the paper describes the dataset and tasks, it does not provide specific information about the prompts used for each subtask, the exact composition of the training, validation, and test sets, or the specific configurations of the LLMs used. This lack of granularity makes it challenging to evaluate the validity of the results and the generalizability of the proposed approach. The evaluation methodology also presents several weaknesses. The paper primarily uses accuracy as a metric for classification tasks and average scores for review quality aspects. However, it does not include standard text generation metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, or METEOR, which are commonly used in the field. This omission makes it difficult to compare the proposed approach with existing methods or human performance. Furthermore, the paper does not include a direct comparison with human-generated reviews, which is essential for assessing the quality and naturalness of the AI-generated reviews. The absence of such a comparison makes it difficult to determine whether the proposed system can truly replicate the nuances and complexities of human peer review. The paper also lacks a detailed description of the training data, including its size, composition, and preprocessing steps. This information is crucial for assessing the generalizability of the results and identifying potential biases in the dataset. The paper mentions using the NeurIPS 2023 dataset, but it does not provide specific details about the number of papers, reviews, or any preprocessing steps applied. This lack of transparency hinders the reproducibility and validity of the results. The description of how AIReviewerPlus incorporates author feedback into the review policy optimization is also vague. The paper mentions that the author provides feedback, which is used to update the review policy, but it does not explain the precise mechanism of how this feedback is translated into updates to the model's parameters or policy. The paper also lacks a clear explanation of the iterative review process, making it unclear how the model handles multiple rounds of feedback and ensures the consistency and coherence of the reviews. Finally, the paper does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed approach, such as the potential for bias in the training data to propagate through the AI-generated reviews, and the challenges of handling complex and nuanced review scenarios. The lack of a detailed comparison with existing LLM-based review systems also makes it difficult to assess the specific advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach. While the paper claims that AIReviewerStar outperforms existing systems, it does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific architectural or methodological choices that lead to this superior performance. These weaknesses, taken together, significantly impact the paper's overall validity and the confidence I have in its conclusions. The lack of clarity, rigor, and transparency in the methodology and evaluation makes it difficult to assess the true potential of the proposed AIReviewer system.\n",

      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete and actionable improvements. First and foremost, the authors should provide clear and precise definitions for all technical terms, especially 'order-n' reasoning. This term, central to the proposed approach, needs a formal definition that explains its relationship to first-order and second-order reasoning. The authors should also provide a detailed description of the training process for each model, including the specific loss functions, optimization algorithms, hyperparameter settings, and training epochs. This information is crucial for reproducibility and for assessing the robustness of the proposed approach. The experimental setup should be described in sufficient detail to allow for reproducibility, including the specific prompts used for each task, the exact composition of the training, validation, and test sets, and the specific configurations of the LLMs used. The authors should also provide a detailed description of the training data, including its source, size, preprocessing steps, and any potential biases. This information is crucial for assessing the generalizability of the results. The paper should also include a more rigorous evaluation methodology, using standard metrics for text generation tasks, such as ROUGE, BLEU, or METEOR, in addition to the current metrics. Comparing the performance of the proposed models to human-generated reviews would also be beneficial to assess the quality of the automated reviews. The authors should also clarify how AIReviewerPlus incorporates author feedback into the review policy optimization. A detailed description of the feedback mechanism, including the specific types of feedback considered and how they are used to update the model's parameters, is necessary. The authors should also explain how the model handles multiple rounds of feedback and how it ensures the consistency and coherence of the reviews. The paper would also benefit from a more systematic approach to evaluation, including a comparison of the performance of the models on different types of papers and review criteria. This would help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach and to guide future research. The authors should also discuss the limitations of their approach, including the potential for bias and the challenges of handling complex and nuanced review scenarios. Finally, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the types of errors made by the models and the factors that contribute to their performance. The authors should also include a more comprehensive comparison with existing LLM-based review systems, going beyond the claim that AIReviewerStar outperforms them. This comparison should include a detailed analysis of the specific advantages and disadvantages of each approach, considering factors such as computational resources, scalability, and the ability to handle different types of research papers. The authors should also discuss the potential for the existing LLM-based systems to be fine-tuned or adapted to achieve similar performance, and what specific architectural or methodological choices of AIReviewerStar lead to its superior performance. This could involve a detailed analysis of the model architectures, training procedures, and reward functions used by each system. The paper should also address the potential for the existing LLM-based systems to be combined with the AIReviewer system to achieve even better performance, and what challenges might arise from such an integration. By addressing these points, the authors can significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and validity of their work.\n",

      "Several key uncertainties remain after my analysis of the paper, and I believe addressing these questions would significantly enhance its overall quality. First, I am curious about the specific implementation of 'order-n' reasoning. The paper introduces this concept but does not provide a formal definition or explain how it is implemented within the model. I would like to know how this 'order-n' reasoning is different from traditional reasoning methods and how it contributes to the performance of the AIReviewer system. Second, I am interested in the details of the training process for AIReviewerStar. The paper mentions using DPO, but it does not specify the hyperparameter settings, optimization algorithms, or training epochs used. I would like to know how the DPO loss function is specifically applied and how the model is optimized for review quality. Third, I am curious about the specific types of feedback considered in AIReviewerPlus. The paper mentions that the author provides feedback, but it does not detail the specific types of feedback used (e.g., textual comments, ratings, suggestions). I would like to know how this feedback is translated into updates to the model's parameters or policy and how the model handles multiple rounds of feedback. Fourth, I am interested in the performance of the proposed system on different types of papers and review criteria. The paper evaluates the system on the NeurIPS 2023 dataset, but it does not analyze the performance on different subfields or review criteria. I would like to know how the system performs on different types of papers and whether it is more effective for certain types of reviews. Fifth, I am curious about the potential for bias in the training data to propagate through the AI-generated reviews. The paper does not address this issue, and I would like to know how the authors plan to mitigate this risk. Finally, I am interested in the computational resources required by the AIReviewer system. The paper does not provide details about the computational resources needed to train and run the models, and I would like to know how scalable the proposed approach is and whether it can be used in real-world scenarios. These questions target core methodological choices and seek clarification of critical assumptions, and I believe that addressing them would significantly improve the paper's overall quality and impact.\n",

      "Originality: The paper presents an approach by combining single-agent and multi-agent simulations to create a comprehensive dataset that closely resembles real-world peer reviews. The two-stage training approach, involving supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, is a novel application in the context of peer review simulation.\n",

      "Dataset Limitations: The SimPEER dataset is based solely on NeurIPS and ICLR papers, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other domains or types of scientific research. Including papers from a wider range of conferences or journals could enhance the robustness and applicability of the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Single-Metric Optimization: The preference optimization is primarily based on human preferences for review quality. However, peer review is a multifaceted process that involves various factors, including ethical considerations, potential biases, and the significance of the research. A more comprehensive approach that incorporates multiple metrics and dimensions of peer review could provide a more balanced and accurate optimization of the AI agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of Error Analysis: While the paper provides quantitative evaluations of the AI agent's performance, it lacks a detailed error analysis that could offer insights into the types of mistakes the model makes and areas for improvement. An in-depth error analysis could help identify specific challenges in simulating peer review and guide future research in addressing these issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limited Discussion on Ethical Implications: The paper briefly mentions the potential for biases in peer review but does not delve into a detailed discussion of the ethical implications of using LLMs in this context. Issues such as fairness, accountability, and transparency are crucial when deploying AI in peer review processes. A more thorough exploration of these ethical considerations would strengthen the paper's contribution to the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The dataset limitations are a significant concern, as the current dataset's reliance on NeurIPS and ICLR papers may not capture the diversity of peer review practices across different scientific fields. To address this, future work should consider expanding the dataset to include papers from a broader range of conferences and journals, encompassing various disciplines such as computer vision, natural language processing, and statistical methodology. This expansion should not only include different topics but also different review formats and expectations. For example, some fields may emphasize practical applications while others focus on theoretical contributions, and these differences should be reflected in the simulated reviews. Furthermore, the dataset should include papers with varying levels of impact and citation counts to ensure the model is robust to different types of research outputs. This would make the findings more generalizable and applicable to a wider range of scientific research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the single-metric optimization, the current approach of using human preferences for review quality as the primary optimization target is insufficient to capture the multifaceted nature of peer review. Future work should explore a more comprehensive set of metrics that incorporate various dimensions of review quality, such as clarity, constructiveness, and ethical considerations. For example, the model should be evaluated on its ability to identify potential ethical issues, such as data misuses or plagiarism, and its capacity to provide balanced feedback that considers both the strengths and weaknesses of a paper. Additionally, the model should be assessed on its ability to identify potential biases in the reviewed work, such as gender or institutional biases. This could be achieved by incorporating metrics that measure the diversity of the feedback and the fairness of the evaluation. The optimization process should also consider the significance of the research, ensuring that the model can distinguish between incremental and groundbreaking contributions. A multi-objective optimization approach could be explored to balance these different metrics and provide a more holistic evaluation of the AI agent's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the lack of error analysis and limited discussion on ethical implications are critical areas that need further attention. A detailed error analysis should be conducted to identify the specific types of mistakes the model makes, such as incorrect assessments of methodological soundness or flawed interpretations of results. This analysis should categorize errors into different types, such as factual errors, logical fallacies, and subjective biases, and provide insights into the underlying causes of these errors. This would help guide future research in addressing these issues and improving the model's performance. Furthermore, the paper should include a more thorough discussion of the ethical implications of using LLMs in peer review, including issues of fairness, accountability, and transparency. The potential for biases in the training data to be amplified by the model should be addressed, and methods for mitigating these biases should be explored. The paper should also discuss the potential impact of using AI in peer review on the academic community, including the potential for job displacement and the need for new skills and training.\n",

      "To address the lack of detail regarding human annotators, the authors should provide a comprehensive description of their characteristics. This should include the number of annotators, their specific qualifications (e.g., years of experience, areas of expertise), and the process used to ensure inter-annotator agreement. It would be beneficial to include a table summarizing the annotators' backgrounds and experience levels. Furthermore, the authors should describe the training or instructions provided to the annotators to ensure consistency and reliability in their evaluations. This would help to establish the credibility of the human preference data used for training and evaluating the AI agent. The authors should also report metrics such as Krippendorff's alpha or Fleiss' alpha to quantify the level of agreement between annotators, which would provide a more objective measure of the reliability of the human annotations.\n",

Furthermore, the authors should evaluate the model's performance on different subgroups of papers (e.g., papers from less well-known researchers, institutions, or regions) to assess whether the model exhibits any unfair or discriminatory behavior.

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel approach to simulating and optimizing the peer review process using large language models (LLMs). The authors have created a Simulated Peer Review (SimPEER) dataset, comprising 2,000 simulated peer review interactions based on machine learning papers from NeurIPS and ICLR conferences. This dataset is a significant contribution, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluating AI-assisted review agents. The core of their methodology involves training an AI researcher agent (ARA) in two stages. First, the ARA undergoes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on high-quality simulations from the SimPEER dataset. This is followed by preference optimization (PO), where the agent is further refined using human preferences for review quality. The resulting agent, named ARA-PO, is then evaluated against commercial LLMs such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5. The empirical findings demonstrate that ARA-PO outperforms these commercial LLMs in generating high-quality reviews, as assessed by human annotators using a detailed scoring metric. Furthermore, ARA-PO shows competitive performance in identifying accept/merge decisions for ML papers, achieving results comparable to expert-based scores. The authors' work is significant because it addresses the critical challenge of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the peer review process, which is a cornerstone of scientific research. By demonstrating the potential of LLMs to generate high-quality reviews and make informed decisions, this paper contributes to the advancement of automated peer review systems, potentially accelerating the scientific discovery process. The two-stage training approach, combining supervised fine-tuning with preference optimization, is a notable methodological contribution, showcasing how simulated data and human preferences can be leveraged to enhance the performance of AI agents in complex tasks. The creation of the SimPEER dataset and the development of ARA-PO represent a substantial step forward in the application of LLMs to scientific workflows, offering a promising avenue for future research in this area.\n",

      "This paper presents several notable strengths that contribute to its overall significance and impact. First and foremost, the introduction of the Simulated Peer Review (SimPEER) dataset is a substantial contribution to the field. This dataset, comprising 2,000 simulated peer review interactions based on NeurIPS and ICLR papers, provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in developing and evaluating AI-assisted peer review systems. The dataset's size and the fact that it includes both single-agent and multi-agent simulations make it a rich and versatile resource. The authors' methodology for training the AI researcher agent (ARA) is another significant strength. The two-stage approach, involving supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by preference optimization (PO), is well-designed and effectively leverages both the simulated data and human preferences. The SFT stage allows the agent to learn from high-quality simulations, while the PO stage refines the agent's performance based on human feedback, leading to a more robust and effective model. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The ARA-PO agent outperforms commercial LLMs such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5 in generating high-quality reviews, as assessed by human annotators using a detailed scoring metric. This finding is significant because it shows that a specialized AI agent, trained on a relevant dataset and with human preferences, can surpass general-purpose LLMs in a complex task like peer review. Furthermore, the ARA-PO agent demonstrates competitive performance in identifying accept/merge decisions for ML papers, achieving results comparable to expert-based scores. This indicates that the agent is not only capable of generating high-quality reviews but also of making informed decisions about paper acceptance. The paper's focus on an important problem in scientific research, the need for efficient and effective peer review processes, is another strength. By developing an AI review agent that can assist in the peer review process, the paper contributes to the betterment of scientific research and accelerates the scientific discovery process. The combination of a novel dataset, a well-designed methodology, and strong empirical results makes this paper a valuable contribution to the field of AI-assisted scientific workflows.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "While this paper presents several strengths, there are also some notable weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. One significant limitation is the dataset's scope. The SimPEER dataset is based solely on papers from NeurIPS and ICLR conferences, as explicitly stated in the 'Datasets' section: 'We collect a total of 2,000 papers from the NeurIPS 2021-2023 and ICLR 2024 conferences.' This narrow focus raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings to other domains or types of scientific research. Different fields have varying review cultures, paper structures, and expectations, and the current dataset may not capture this diversity. This limitation is further compounded by the fact that the dataset is based on past papers, which may not reflect the current state of the field or emerging trends. The preference optimization process also presents a weakness. The paper indicates that preference optimization is primarily based on human preferences for review quality, as described in the 'Preference Optimization (PO)' section: 'For each simulation, we randomly sample two reviews. We then ask human annotators to indicate their preferences between the two reviews.' While human preference is a valuable indicator, peer review is a multifaceted process that involves various factors, including ethical considerations, potential biases, and the significance of the research. The paper does not explicitly address how these other factors are incorporated into the preference optimization process. The paper's evaluation of ARA-PO's performance in identifying accept/merge decisions is also limited. The paper states in the 'Accept/Merge Decisions' section: 'We calculate the Kendall-tau correlation between ARA-PO's opinions and the leaderboard scores.' While correlation is a useful metric, it does not provide a complete picture of the model's performance. The paper lacks a more comprehensive evaluation using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, which are standard for classification tasks. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a confusion matrix to show the types of errors the model makes (e.g., false positives, false negatives). This makes it difficult to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses in the context of decision-making. The paper also lacks a detailed error analysis. While the paper provides quantitative evaluations of the AI agent's performance, it does not include a section dedicated to error analysis or qualitative assessment of the types of errors made by the models. This absence of error analysis makes it difficult to understand the specific weaknesses of the model and where future improvements could be targeted. The paper also provides insufficient details about the human annotators used for validation and preference optimization. The paper mentions in the 'Human Validation of SimPEER Dataset Quality' section: 'We recruit ML graduate students to be annotators.' and in the 'Human Evaluation of Review Quality' section: 'We follow the setup from \\cite{liang2024can}, where the human annotators are researchers and students at top ML labs...' While the paper mentions that each simulation is rated by three annotators, it lacks details on their specific qualifications, experience, and the process for ensuring inter-annotator agreement. This lack of detailed information about annotators makes it difficult to assess the reliability and potential biases in the human annotations. The paper also does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required to train and deploy the ARA-PO agent. The paper mentions using LoRA, DeepSpeed, and ZeRO Stage 2, but lacks information on the GPU type, number of GPUs, training time, and memory requirements. This lack of computational resource details hinders the reproducibility and practical application of the research. Finally, the paper does not adequately address the potential biases that may be present in the SimPEER dataset and the resulting ARA-PO model. The paper briefly mentions bias in the 'Limitations' section: 'Bias. Our study finds that ARA-PO's opinions of ML papers demonstrate a strong correlation with those of ML experts. However, ARA-PO may also learn the biases of the experts...' However, it lacks a detailed discussion on the types of biases present in the dataset and how they might affect the agent's performance. This is a critical oversight, as it could lead to unfair or inaccurate evaluations. These weaknesses, taken together, highlight areas where the paper could be improved to enhance its robustness and generalizability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, several concrete improvements can be made. First, the dataset limitations should be addressed by expanding the SimPEER dataset to include papers from a broader range of conferences and journals, encompassing various disciplines such as computer vision, natural language processing, and statistical methodology. This expansion should not only include different topics but also different review formats and expectations. For example, some fields may emphasize practical applications while others focus on theoretical contributions, and these differences should be reflected in the simulated reviews. Furthermore, the dataset should include papers with varying levels of impact and citation counts to ensure the model is robust to different types of research outputs. This would make the findings more generalizable and applicable to a wider range of scientific research. Second, the preference optimization process should be enhanced by incorporating a more comprehensive set of metrics that capture the multifaceted nature of peer review. In addition to human preferences for review quality, the model should be evaluated on its ability to identify potential ethical issues, such as data misuse or plagiarism, and its capacity to provide balanced feedback that considers both the strengths and weaknesses of a paper. Additionally, the model should be assessed on its ability to identify potential biases in the reviewed work, such as gender or institutional biases. This could be achieved by incorporating metrics that measure the diversity of the feedback and the fairness of the evaluation. The optimization process should also consider the significance of the research, ensuring that the model can distinguish between incremental and groundbreaking contributions. A multi-objective optimization approach could be explored to balance these different metrics and provide a more holistic evaluation of the AI agent's performance. Third, the evaluation of ARA-PO's decision-making capabilities should be improved by including a more comprehensive set of metrics beyond correlation. Specifically, the authors should report precision, recall, and F1-score for the accept/merge decision task. A confusion matrix should also be included to show the types of errors the model makes (e.g., false positives, false negatives). This would provide a more detailed understanding of the model's performance and its ability to accurately classify papers. Additionally, the authors could consider using metrics such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to evaluate the model's ability to discriminate between papers that should be accepted/merged and those that should not. This would provide a more robust evaluation of the model's decision-making capabilities. Fourth, a detailed error analysis should be conducted to identify the specific types of mistakes the model makes, such as incorrect assessments of methodological soundness or flawed interpretations of results. This analysis should categorize errors into different types, such as factual errors, logical fallacies, and subjective biases, and provide insights into the underlying causes of these errors. This would help guide future research in addressing these issues and improving the model's performance. Fifth, the paper should provide more details about the human annotators used for validation and preference optimization. This should include the number of annotators, their specific qualifications (e.g., years of experience, areas of expertise), and the process used to ensure inter-annotator agreement. It would be beneficial to include a table summarizing the annotators' backgrounds and experience levels. Furthermore, the authors should describe the training or instructions provided to the annotators to ensure consistency and reliability in their evaluations. This would help to establish the credibility of the human preference data used for training and evaluating the AI agent. The authors should also report metrics such as Krippendorff's alpha or Fleiss' alpha to quantify the level of agreement between annotators, which would provide a more objective measure of the reliability of the human annotations. Sixth, the paper should include a detailed analysis of the computational resources required to train and deploy the ARA-PO agent. This should include the specific GPU model(s) used, the number of GPUs in the training cluster, the training time in hours or days, the memory requirements during training and inference, and the average inference time per review. Furthermore, the authors should provide an estimate of the cost associated with training the model, which would be valuable for researchers considering replicating the study. Finally, the paper should explicitly address the potential biases in the SimPEER dataset and the resulting ARA-PO model. This should include a discussion of the types of biases that may be present (e.g., methodological, institutional, demographic) and how these biases might affect the model's performance and fairness. The authors should also explore methods for mitigating these biases, such as using debiasing techniques during training or incorporating fairness constraints into the model's objective function. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate the model's performance on different subgroups of papers (e.g., papers from less well-known researchers, institutions, or regions) to assess whether the model exhibits any unfair or discriminatory behavior. This would help to ensure that the model is not only accurate but also fair and unbiased.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Several questions arise from my analysis of this paper, focusing on key uncertainties and methodological choices. First, how were the human annotators selected, and what measures were taken to ensure their expertise and minimize potential biases in their annotations? The paper mentions using ML graduate students and researchers, but it lacks details on their specific qualifications, experience, and the process for ensuring inter-annotator agreement. Understanding the annotators' background and the measures taken to ensure consistency is crucial for assessing the reliability of the human preference data. Second, how do you plan to address the potential biases in the SimPEER dataset and the resulting ARA-PO model? Have you considered evaluating the model's performance on different subgroups of papers to assess fairness? The paper acknowledges the potential for bias but does not provide a detailed analysis of the types of biases present in the dataset or how they might affect the agent's performance. Understanding the specific biases and the methods for mitigating them is essential for ensuring the fairness and reliability of the model. Third, can you elaborate on the preference optimization process? What criteria were used to define 'high-quality' reviews, and how were human preferences gathered and incorporated into the training process? The paper mentions using human preferences for review quality but does not provide details on the specific criteria used to define 'high-quality' or the process for gathering human preferences. Understanding these details is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the preference optimization process. Fourth, how do you ensure the reproducibility of your experiments, particularly in terms of the training and evaluation of the AI agents? Will you be releasing the SimPEER dataset and the trained models? The paper lacks details on the computational resources used for training and deployment, which hinders the reproducibility of the research. Understanding the hardware and software requirements and the availability of the dataset and models is crucial for other researchers to replicate and build upon this work. Fifth, how do you handle multi-turn interactions in multi-agent simulations? Can you provide more details on the mechanisms used to manage the interactions between multiple reviewers and submissions? The paper mentions multi-agent simulations but does not provide details on how these interactions are managed. Understanding the mechanisms for managing multi-turn interactions is crucial for assessing the realism and effectiveness of the simulations. Finally, what are the limitations of using simulated peer reviews for training the ARA-PO agent? How do you address the potential gap between simulated and real-world peer review dynamics? The paper acknowledges the potential for bias in the simulated reviews but does not discuss the limitations of using simulated data for training. Understanding the limitations of simulated data and the methods for addressing the gap between simulated and real-world dynamics is crucial for assessing the generalizability of the findings.\n",

      "1. The concept of benchmarking papers is not clearly defined. The paper briefly mentions that these are \"other relevant papers\" but does not specify criteria for relevance or how these papers are selected. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the validity of the proposed approach. For example, it is unclear whether benchmarking papers are chosen based on citation counts, topic similarity, or some other metric. The absence of a concrete definition hinders the reproducibility of the experiments and limits the generalizability of the findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The paper claims that the multi-paper benchmarking approach incentivizes agents to provide more comprehensive and detailed reviews, but there is no empirical evidence to support this claim. The results presented in Figure 4 and Table 2 primarily focus on the originality and significance of the reviews, but the abstractness of the reviews is not evaluated. While the authors suggest that higher originality and significance imply more comprehensive reviews, this is not a direct measure. A more rigorous evaluation would require metrics that directly assess the depth and breadth of the review content, such as the number of unique points raised or the coverage of different aspects of the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The evaluation of the system is limited to the abstract level, which raises concerns about the practical applicability of the proposed method. While abstract-level evaluation can provide some insights, it does not fully capture the complexities of real-world peer review. The system's performance on full papers, which often contain intricate methodologies and detailed experimental setups, remains unknown. This limitation makes it difficult to assess the system's ability to handle the nuances and subtleties of comprehensive scientific papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the lack of clarity regarding benchmarking papers, the authors should provide a detailed definition of what constitutes a benchmarking paper within their framework. This definition should include specific criteria for selecting these papers, such as their relevance to the topic, their methodological similarity, or their contribution to the field. For instance, the authors could specify that benchmarking papers are selected based on a combination of topic similarity, measured by cosine similarity of word embeddings, and citation counts, ensuring that both relevant and influential papers are included. Furthermore, the authors should explain how the number of benchmarking papers is determined for each review and whether this number is fixed or varies depending on the paper's characteristics. This level of detail is crucial for ensuring the reproducibility of the experiments and for allowing other researchers to build upon their work. Without a clear definition, the core concept of the paper remains vague and difficult to evaluate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To strengthen the claim that multi-paper benchmarking leads to more comprehensive reviews, the authors should include empirical evidence that directly measures the comprehensiveness of the generated reviews. Instead of relying solely on originality and significance scores, which are indirect measures, the authors could use metrics such as the number of unique points raised in the review, the coverage of different aspects of the paper (e.g., methodology, experiments, theory), or the depth of the analysis. For example, the authors could use a combination of quantitative metrics, such as the number of sentences addressing different aspects of the paper, and qualitative metrics, such as human evaluations of the depth of the analysis. Additionally, the authors should conduct experiments that compare the comprehensiveness of reviews generated with and without benchmarking papers, using the same LLM and prompt settings, to isolate the effect of benchmarking. This would provide more direct evidence for the claim that multi-paper benchmarking leads to more comprehensive reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, to address the limitation of evaluating the system at the abstract level, the authors should conduct experiments using full papers. This would provide a more realistic assessment of the system's performance and its ability to handle the complexities of real-world peer review. The authors should also consider evaluating the system's ability to identify specific issues in the paper, such as methodological flaws, experimental errors, or theoretical inconsistencies. This could be done by comparing the system's reviews with human reviews and assessing the degree to which the system identifies the same issues. Furthermore, the authors should investigate how the system handles different types of papers, such as theoretical papers, experimental papers, and review papers, to ensure that the system is robust and generalizable. By conducting these additional experiments, the authors can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their system and demonstrate its practical applicability.\n",

      "\n",
      "To address the lack of clarity regarding the manager agent's review selection process, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of the criteria used to evaluate review quality. This should include specific metrics such as the number of unique issues identified, the depth of analysis, the clarity of explanations, and the relevance of the feedback to the paper's core contributions. Furthermore, the authors should describe the algorithm used to rank and select the top three reviews. For example, is it a simple scoring system, or does it involve a more complex machine learning model? If a machine learning model is used, the authors should provide details on its training data, architecture, and performance. It would also be beneficial to include examples of reviews that were selected and those that were not, along with an explanation of why the selected reviews were considered superior. This would provide a more concrete understanding of the selection process and its effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "To clarify how the MPBR system provides more comprehensive and detailed reviews, the authors should provide a detailed breakdown of the evaluation metrics used to compare the MPBR system with traditional peer review. This should include metrics such as the average length of reviews, the number of unique concepts discussed, the depth of analysis, and the number of specific examples provided. The authors should also explain how these metrics correlate with the perceived quality of the reviews. For example, a longer review is not necessarily better if it is repetitive or lacks depth. It would be beneficial to see a comparison of the distribution of these metrics for both MPBR-generated reviews and traditional peer reviews. This would allow for a more quantitative assessment of the comprehensiveness and detail of the reviews. Furthermore, the authors should provide examples of reviews that highlight the differences in comprehensiveness and detail between the two approaches.\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel approach to scientific peer review, termed Multi-Paper Benchmarking Review (MPBR), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the review process. The core idea behind MPBR is to evaluate a given paper in the context of other relevant, pre-existing research, referred to as 'benchmarking papers.' This approach aims to foster a more comprehensive and competitive review environment, encouraging the identification of original and significant contributions. The authors propose an agent-based system, comprising reviewer agents and a manager agent, to automate the review process. Reviewer agents generate individual reviews, while the manager agent selects and aggregates the most valuable feedback. The system is trained and evaluated using a newly constructed benchmark dataset derived from real-world reviews of AI conference submissions. The authors demonstrate that MPBR can produce higher-quality reviews, as measured by metrics such as originality, significance, and quality, compared to traditional peer review. They also show that the system can identify methodological flaws and foster knowledge creation. The paper presents a real-world study where the MPBR system was used to review papers submitted to AI conferences, providing further evidence of its practical applicability. The authors claim that their system is self-sustaining, requiring minimal human intervention, and can reduce the costs associated with traditional peer review. Overall, the paper presents a compelling vision for the future of scientific peer review, leveraging the power of LLMs to enhance the quality and efficiency of the process. However, as I will detail, there are several areas where the methodology and evaluation could be strengthened to further validate the proposed approach.\n",

      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly compelling. The most significant strength is the introduction of the Multi-Paper Benchmarking Review (MPBR) task itself. This is a novel and insightful approach to scientific peer review, moving beyond the traditional single-paper focus. By explicitly incorporating 'benchmarking papers' into the review process, the authors encourage a more comparative and competitive evaluation of research, which I believe can lead to more original and significant ideas. The agent-based system, with its reviewer and manager agents, is another notable contribution. This system automates the review process, reducing the burden on human reviewers and potentially minimizing biases. The use of a manager agent to select and aggregate the best reviews is a clever way to synthesize diverse perspectives and ensure the quality of the final output. Furthermore, the construction of a new benchmark dataset using real-world reviews from top AI conferences is a valuable contribution to the field. This dataset, which includes annotations for originality and significance, provides a much-needed resource for developing and evaluating LLM-based review systems. The authors' efforts to validate their approach through a real-world study, where the MPBR system was used to review papers submitted to AI conferences, is also commendable. This demonstrates the practical applicability of their system and provides further evidence of its effectiveness. Finally, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, making the core concepts and contributions accessible to a broad audience. The authors clearly articulate their motivation, methodology, and findings, which I appreciate. The combination of these strengths makes this paper a significant contribution to the field of AI-assisted scientific peer review.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology used to construct the benchmark dataset. While the authors mention that the dataset is derived from real-world reviews of top AI conferences, they do not provide specific details on how the papers and reviews were selected. For instance, the paper states that they collected 16,130 reviews for 5,445 papers, but it is unclear how these specific papers and reviews were chosen from the vast collection of AI conference submissions. The paper also mentions that the reviews were labeled for originality and significance using a combination of rule-based matching and state-of-the-art models, but it does not provide details on the specific rule-based methods or models used, nor how they were combined. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the quality and representativeness of the dataset, which is crucial for the validity of the experimental results. The absence of a clear methodology also hinders the reproducibility of the experiments and limits the generalizability of the findings. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's 'Benchmark Dataset' section lacks the necessary details. Second, the paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. While the authors present results from a real-world study, the results are limited and do not fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPBR system. The paper lacks quantitative metrics, such as inter-annotator agreement for the dataset annotations, which is a standard practice for evaluating annotation quality. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison with traditional peer review processes. While the real-world study compares MPBR with traditional reviews, the analysis is not extensive, and there is no thorough analysis of the types of errors that the MPBR system can identify compared to human reviewers. The potential for the system to introduce new biases is also not adequately addressed. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the evaluation sections primarily focus on comparisons within the MPBR framework and lack a detailed quantitative comparison with traditional peer review, inter-annotator agreement, and a thorough analysis of error identification and biases. Third, the paper's structure and organization could be improved. The lack of a dedicated 'Method' section makes it difficult to understand the technical details of the proposed approach. While the paper contains information about the method across several sections, it lacks a single, consolidated section that clearly outlines the methodology. The absence of a clear workflow diagram further complicates the understanding of the overall process. The paper would benefit from a more structured presentation of the methodology, including a detailed description of the agent system and its components, and a clear explanation of how the benchmark dataset was constructed and used. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the methodological details are scattered across multiple sections rather than being consolidated in a dedicated 'Method' section, and a workflow diagram is missing. Fourth, the paper's definition of 'benchmarking papers' is initially vague. While the paper later clarifies that these papers are selected using semantic similarity and keyword matching against arXiv, the initial definition is unclear, and the specific algorithms and thresholds used are not detailed. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the validity of the proposed approach. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the initial definition is vague, but the 'Reviewer Manager Agents' section provides more detail on the selection process using semantic similarity and keyword matching. Fifth, the paper claims that the multi-paper benchmarking approach incentivizes agents to provide more comprehensive and detailed reviews, but there is no direct empirical evidence to support this claim. The results presented primarily focus on originality and significance, but the abstractness of the reviews is not evaluated. While the authors suggest that higher originality and significance imply more comprehensive reviews, this is not a direct measure. A more rigorous evaluation would require metrics that directly assess the depth and breadth of the review content, such as the number of unique points raised or the coverage of different aspects of the paper. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper claims increased comprehensiveness and detail but relies on metrics that don't directly measure these qualities. The correlation between the metrics and perceived quality is not discussed. Finally, the paper lacks clarity on how the manager agent selects the three best reviews. While the paper mentions using human feedback for validation, it does not specify the exact criteria or algorithm used to rank and select the top three reviews based on this feedback. The type of human feedback (e.g., specific scores for different aspects of the review) and how it's translated into a selection algorithm are not detailed. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper mentions human feedback for validation but lacks specifics on the criteria and algorithm used by the manager agent to select the top three reviews.\n",

      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, to clarify the benchmark dataset construction, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of the process used to select papers and extract reviews. This should include specific criteria for paper selection, such as the time period, the conferences considered, and the method used to identify relevant reviews. The authors should also describe the annotation process for originality and significance, including the number of annotators, their expertise, and the inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, the authors should clarify how they handled cases where multiple reviews were available for a single paper, and how they ensured the quality and consistency of the annotations. Including examples of the annotation process and the types of reviews included in the dataset would also be beneficial. This level of detail is crucial for the reproducibility and validity of the research. Second, to improve the evaluation of the proposed method, the authors should provide a more comprehensive analysis of the real-world study. This should include quantitative metrics, such as the number of papers reviewed, the acceptance rate, and the feedback from conference chairs and reviewers. The authors should also compare the performance of the MPBR system with traditional peer review processes, using metrics such as the time taken for review, the quality of the feedback, and the identification of methodological flaws. A detailed analysis of the types of errors that the MPBR system can identify compared to human reviewers would also be valuable. This analysis should include examples of specific errors identified by the MPBR system and a discussion of the potential for the system to introduce new biases. The authors should also consider conducting a user study to assess the usability and effectiveness of the MPBR system. Third, to improve the paper's structure and organization, the authors should include a dedicated 'Method' section that provides a detailed description of the proposed approach. This section should include a clear explanation of the agent system and its components, as well as a detailed description of how the benchmark dataset was constructed and used. A workflow diagram would also be beneficial to illustrate the overall process. The authors should also consider reorganizing the paper to improve the flow of information and make it easier for readers to understand the proposed approach. This could include moving some of the experimental details to an appendix and focusing on the key findings in the main body of the paper. Fourth, to address the lack of clarity regarding benchmarking papers, the authors should provide a detailed definition of what constitutes a benchmarking paper within their framework. This definition should include specific criteria for selecting these papers, such as their relevance to the topic, their methodological similarity, or their contribution to the field. For instance, the authors could specify that benchmarking papers are selected based on a combination of topic similarity, measured by cosine similarity of word embeddings, and citation counts, ensuring that both relevant and influential papers are included. Furthermore, the authors should explain how the number of benchmarking papers is determined for each review and whether this number is fixed or varies depending on the paper's characteristics. This level of detail is crucial for ensuring the reproducibility of the experiments and for allowing other researchers to build upon their work. Fifth, to strengthen the claim that multi-paper benchmarking leads to more comprehensive reviews, the authors should include empirical evidence that directly measures the comprehensiveness of the generated reviews. Instead of relying solely on originality and significance scores, which are indirect measures, the authors could use metrics such as the number of unique points raised in the review, the coverage of different aspects of the paper (e.g., methodology, experiments, theory), or the depth of the analysis. For example, the authors could use a combination of quantitative metrics, such as the number of sentences addressing different aspects of the paper, and qualitative metrics, such as human evaluations of the depth of the analysis. Additionally, the authors should conduct experiments that compare the comprehensiveness of reviews generated with and without benchmarking papers, using the same LLM and prompt settings, to isolate the effect of benchmarking. Finally, to address the lack of clarity regarding the manager agent's review selection process, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of the criteria used to evaluate review quality. This should include specific metrics such as the number of unique issues identified, the depth of analysis, the clarity of explanations, and the relevance of the feedback to the paper's core contributions. Furthermore, the authors should describe the algorithm used to rank and select the top three reviews. For example, is it a simple scoring system, or does it involve a more complex machine learning model? If a machine learning model is used, the authors should provide details on its training data, architecture, and performance. It would also be beneficial to include examples of reviews that were selected and those that were not, along with an explanation of why the selected reviews were considered superior. These suggestions, if implemented, would significantly strengthen the paper and further validate the proposed approach.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the paper's methodology and findings. First, could the authors provide more details on the methodology used to construct the benchmark dataset? Specifically, how were the papers and reviews selected, and what criteria were used for annotation? I am particularly interested in the specific rule-based methods and state-of-the-art models used for labeling originality and significance, and how these were combined. Second, can the authors elaborate on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the MPBR system? How do these metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to traditional peer review? I am especially interested in how the metrics correlate with the perceived quality of the reviews and how the system's ability to identify methodological flaws is measured. Third, how does the MPBR system handle cases where there is a disagreement among reviewer agents? Is there a mechanism for resolving such disagreements, and if so, how does it work? I am curious about the specific criteria and algorithm used by the manager agent to select the top three reviews, and how human feedback is incorporated into this process. Fourth, what are the potential limitations or biases of the MPBR system, and how do the authors plan to address them in future work? I am particularly interested in the potential for the system to introduce new biases and how the authors plan to mitigate these risks. Fifth, how do the authors define and select benchmarking papers? What criteria are used to determine their relevance, and how is the number of benchmarking papers determined for each review? I am interested in the specific algorithms and thresholds used for semantic similarity and keyword matching, and how the quality of benchmarking papers is ensured. Finally, can the authors provide empirical evidence that demonstrates the multi-paper benchmarking approach leads to more comprehensive and detailed reviews compared to traditional peer review or single-paper reviews? I am interested in the specific metrics used to measure the depth and breadth of the review content, and how these metrics correlate with the perceived quality of the reviews. These questions are aimed at clarifying key uncertainties and assumptions in the paper, and I believe that addressing them would significantly enhance the paper's overall contribution.\n",

      " - The paper is very difficult to read, and the writing is poor. The authors use many technical terms without explaining them, making it hard to follow. Additionally, the paper is full of jargon and complex language that is not necessary.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The authors claim that their framework is \"highly effective in producing high-quality reviews that are preferred by authors and better aligned with actual reviews.\" However, this claim is not well-supported by the evidence provided.

      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper needs significant improvements in clarity and experimental validation. The authors should begin by thoroughly explaining all technical terms and jargon used in the paper. This includes providing clear definitions and context for terms like 'multi-agent system,' 'reward modeling mechanism,' and any other specialized vocabulary. The paper should be written in a way that is accessible to a broader audience, not just those already deeply familiar with the specific techniques used. Additionally, the authors should avoid unnecessary complex language and strive for a more straightforward and concise writing style. The use of concrete examples to illustrate key concepts would also greatly improve the paper's readability. For instance, when describing the interaction between the LLM agents, a step-by-step example of a review simulation would be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "To strengthen the claims about the framework's effectiveness, the authors need to conduct more rigorous experiments. The current experiments do not provide sufficient evidence to support the strong claims made about the quality of reviews, author preference, and alignment with actual reviews. The authors should consider using a larger and more diverse dataset for testing the framework. They should also include a more detailed analysis of the results, including statistical significance tests and comparisons with other existing methods. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of how the framework's performance is measured. For example, how is 'review quality' defined and quantified? How is 'alignment with actual reviews' assessed? Providing these details will allow for a more objective evaluation of the framework's performance. The authors should also consider including a human evaluation of the generated reviews to provide a more qualitative assessment of the framework's effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the authors need to provide more evidence to support the claim that their framework is more representative of the actual review process. They should provide a detailed comparison of the framework's simulation of the review process with the actual process, highlighting the specific aspects that are better represented by their model. This could include a discussion of how the framework captures the iterative nature of reviews, the different perspectives of reviewers, and the influence of author feedback. The authors should also address the limitations of their framework and discuss potential areas for future improvement. For example, how does the framework handle situations where reviewers disagree? How does the framework account for the potential biases of reviewers? Addressing these limitations will help to provide a more balanced and realistic assessment of the framework's capabilities.\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces ReviewGame, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate the scientific review process as a competitive multi-agent game. The core idea is to model the review process as a competition among multiple LLM agents, each acting as a reviewer, with the goal of producing the best review. This approach contrasts with previous single-agent models and aims to better reflect the dynamics of real-world peer review. The framework incorporates author feedback and is explicitly connected to the scientific method, emphasizing the importance of refutation and critical scrutiny. The authors evaluate ReviewGame on the ICLR 2024 submissions, comparing it against GPT-4o and the chain-of-thought (CoT) method. Their empirical findings suggest that ReviewGame outperforms these baselines in terms of review quality, author preference, and alignment with actual review outcomes. The authors claim that their framework has the potential to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific peer review, ultimately accelerating the pace of scientific discovery. The paper's main contribution lies in its innovative approach to modeling peer review as a competitive multi-agent game, and the empirical results provide some support for its effectiveness. However, the paper also has several limitations, particularly in its lack of detailed comparisons with other multi-agent LLM frameworks, its limited analysis of computational resources, and its somewhat overreaching claims about the impact of the framework. Despite these limitations, the paper presents a promising approach to automating and improving the scientific review process.\n",

      "\n",
      "I find the core idea of modeling the scientific review process as a competitive multi-agent game to be a significant strength of this paper. This approach, which the authors term ReviewGame, is a novel way to simulate the dynamics of peer review, moving beyond the limitations of single-agent models. By having multiple LLM agents compete to produce the best review, the framework aims to capture the iterative and critical nature of the review process more accurately. The connection the authors draw between their framework and the scientific method is also a notable strength. By emphasizing refutation and critical scrutiny, they ground their approach in a well-established paradigm, adding theoretical depth to their work. This connection highlights the potential of ReviewGame to enhance the quality of scientific review by encouraging a more rigorous evaluation of research. Furthermore, the empirical evaluations conducted on the ICLR 2024 submissions provide valuable evidence for the effectiveness of ReviewGame. The authors demonstrate that their framework outperforms GPT-4o and the chain-of-thought method in terms of review quality, author preference, and alignment with actual review outcomes. These results, based on a substantial dataset of 749 papers, suggest that ReviewGame has the potential to generate high-quality reviews that are both preferred by authors and aligned with the actual review process. The inclusion of a pilot study on NeurIPS submissions further strengthens the empirical basis of the paper. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its innovative approach, its theoretical grounding in the scientific method, and its empirical validation on a real-world dataset.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "After a thorough examination of the paper, I've identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing multi-agent LLM frameworks. While the authors mention related work, they do not provide a rigorous analysis of how ReviewGame differs from and improves upon these frameworks. Specifically, the paper does not address how ReviewGame's competitive multi-agent approach compares to collaborative multi-agent systems for scientific review. This omission is significant because a more comprehensive understanding of its novelty and advantages can only be achieved through a detailed comparison with other multi-agent systems. The paper mentions related work in the \"Related Work\" section, including \\citet{jin2024agentreviewexploringpeerreview} and \\citet{liang2024can} which employ LLMs as agents in a multi-reviewer setting. However, the paper does not delve into the specific algorithms, communication protocols, or reward mechanisms of other multi-agent LLM frameworks for scientific review. This lack of comparison makes it difficult to assess the true novelty and contribution of ReviewGame. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's content clearly lacks the necessary comparative analysis. Second, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for implementing ReviewGame. This is a critical omission, as the practicality and scalability of the framework depend heavily on its computational demands. The paper should include a breakdown of the computational costs associated with each stage of the ReviewGame process, such as the initial review generation, critique stage, and author feedback stage. This should include the number of LLM calls, the type of hardware used (e.g., GPU model), and the time taken for each stage. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the memory requirements and the potential for parallelization to reduce computational time. The absence of this information makes it difficult to assess the feasibility of implementing ReviewGame in real-world scenarios. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper provides no information on computational resources. Third, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the ReviewGame framework and potential areas for future research. While the paper includes a \"Limitations and Broader Impacts\" section, it is very brief and does not address several important issues. For example, the paper does not address how the framework handles situations where reviewers disagree significantly or how it accounts for potential biases in the LLMs used. The paper should also discuss the limitations of using LLMs for review generation, such as the potential for generating reviews that are superficial or lack the depth of human expert reviews. Additionally, the paper should explore how the framework could be extended to handle different types of scientific reviews, such as those for grant proposals or conference submissions. The lack of a thorough discussion of these limitations and future directions weakens the paper's overall impact. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's discussion of limitations is clearly insufficient. Finally, the paper's writing style and use of technical jargon make it difficult to read. The authors use many technical terms without explaining them, making it hard to follow. Additionally, the paper is full of jargon and complex language that is not necessary. This lack of clarity hinders the accessibility of the paper and makes it difficult for a broader audience to understand the core concepts and contributions. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as while the paper does present the information, the presentation could be significantly improved for clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements for this paper. First, the authors should include a more detailed comparison with existing multi-agent LLM frameworks. This comparison should not only focus on the high-level architecture but also delve into the technical details of how agents interact, how they are trained, and how their performance is evaluated. Specifically, the authors should compare ReviewGame's competitive approach with collaborative multi-agent systems, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in the context of scientific review. A table summarizing the key differences between ReviewGame and other relevant frameworks would be beneficial. Furthermore, the authors should discuss the potential for incorporating elements of collaborative approaches into ReviewGame to enhance its performance. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the novelty and advantages of ReviewGame. Second, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for implementing ReviewGame. This analysis should include a breakdown of the computational costs associated with each stage of the ReviewGame process, such as the initial review generation, critique stage, and author feedback stage. This should include the number of LLM calls, the type of hardware used (e.g., GPU model), and the time taken for each stage. The authors should also discuss the memory requirements and the potential for parallelization to reduce computational time. It would be beneficial to include a discussion of the trade-offs between computational cost and review quality, exploring whether there are ways to reduce the computational burden without sacrificing the quality of the generated reviews. The authors should also consider the scalability of the framework, discussing how the computational costs would increase with a larger number of submissions or reviewers. Third, the authors should include a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the ReviewGame framework and potential areas for future research. This should include a discussion of how the framework handles situations where reviewers disagree significantly, how it accounts for potential biases in the LLMs used, and how it could be extended to handle different types of scientific reviews. The authors should also explore the potential for incorporating human feedback into the training process to improve the quality and reliability of the generated reviews. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the ethical implications of using LLMs for scientific review, such as the potential for bias and the need for transparency and accountability. Finally, the authors should significantly improve the clarity and accessibility of their writing. This includes providing clear definitions and context for technical terms and avoiding unnecessary complex language. The use of concrete examples to illustrate key concepts would also greatly improve the paper's readability. For instance, when describing the interaction between the LLM agents, a step-by-step example of a review simulation would be beneficial. These changes would make the paper more accessible to a broader audience and enhance its overall impact.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for further understanding and improving the ReviewGame framework. First, how does ReviewGame handle situations where reviewers disagree significantly? The paper does not provide a detailed explanation of how the framework manages conflicting opinions among reviewers, which is a common occurrence in real-world peer review. Understanding how ReviewGame resolves or mitigates such disagreements is essential for assessing its robustness and reliability. Second, can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required for implementing ReviewGame? This includes the number of LLM calls, the type of hardware used, the time taken for each stage, and the memory requirements. This information is crucial for assessing the practicality and scalability of the framework. Third, how does ReviewGame account for potential biases in the LLMs used? The paper acknowledges that the reward model is trained on a dataset of paper-author-interaction trajectories, which may introduce biases. However, it does not provide a detailed explanation of how these biases are identified and mitigated. Understanding how the framework addresses potential biases is essential for ensuring the fairness and objectivity of the review process. Fourth, can ReviewGame be extended to handle different types of scientific reviews, such as those for grant proposals or conference submissions? The paper focuses primarily on peer review for academic papers, but the framework's adaptability to other review scenarios is an important area for future research. Finally, could the authors provide more details about the experiments they conducted to support their claims about the framework's effectiveness? Specifically, how did they measure the quality of reviews, author preference, and alignment with actual reviews? Additionally, how did they compare ReviewGame to other methods, and what evidence do they have to support the claim that ReviewGame is more representative of the actual review process? These questions target key uncertainties and methodological choices that need further clarification.\n",

This would involve curating datasets of papers from these domains and evaluating the performance of AIReviewer and AIResearch. The evaluation should also consider the specific challenges of each domain, such as different experimental designs, evaluation metrics, and terminology. For example, in biomedicine, the focus might be on the validity of clinical trials and the interpretation of statistical results, while in physics, the emphasis might be on the theoretical soundness and experimental reproducibility. Furthermore, the authors should explore how the models handle interdisciplinary research, which often combines methodologies and concepts from multiple fields. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the proposed systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the evaluation of AIReviewer and AIResearch, the authors should incorporate standard quantitative metrics for review quality and idea novelty. For review quality, metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score could be used to assess the accuracy of the reviews in identifying strengths, weaknesses, and potential errors in the papers. The authors should also consider using metrics that measure the clarity, coherence, and constructiveness of the reviews. For idea novelty, metrics such as the number of novel concepts generated, the diversity of the generated ideas, and the impact of the ideas on the scientific community could be used. The authors should also explore the use of human evaluation to validate the quantitative metrics and provide a more comprehensive assessment of the quality and novelty of the reviews and ideas.

The authors should also explore the use of different reward models that are trained on diverse datasets and that incorporate different evaluation criteria. Furthermore, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of the potential biases in the generated reviews and ideas, and they should develop methods to mitigate these biases. This would involve examining the reviews and ideas for evidence of bias and developing strategies to ensure that the AI systems are fair, objective, and unbiased. The authors should also provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for training and deploying AIReviewer and AIResearch, including the hardware requirements, training time, and inference costs.

      "## Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper introduces two innovative AI-powered agents, AIReviewer and AIResearch, designed to automate scientific peer review and idea generation, respectively. AIReviewer is an interactive system that conducts multi-round reviews of scientific papers, engaging in a dialogue with authors to provide detailed feedback. It leverages a large language model (LLM) to assess paper quality and suggest improvements, aiming to streamline the peer review process. AIResearch, on the other hand, employs a collaborative approach where two AI agents engage in debate-style conversations to generate novel scientific ideas. These ideas are then refined and ranked using a specialized AI4Science Reward Model, trained on preference data from AIReview. The core methodological approach involves training these agents using LLMs and evaluating their performance through comparisons with human reviewers and expert ratings. The empirical findings suggest that AIReviewer can produce reviews comparable in quality to intermediate human reviewers, and AIResearch can efficiently generate novel and high-quality scientific ideas, outperforming the PACCAR model in terms of generation speed and idea quality. The paper also introduces a benchmark dataset of AIReview reviews on ISMRL papers, which can be used for future development of scientific peer review and idea generation models. Overall, the paper presents a significant step towards automating key aspects of the scientific process, with potential implications for research efficiency and collaboration. However, the study also reveals several limitations that need to be addressed to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the proposed systems.\n",

      "\n",
      "I find the introduction of AIReviewer and AIResearch to be a significant strength of this paper. The authors have creatively combined multi-agent debate and preference learning techniques to tackle the complex tasks of scientific peer review and idea generation. The concept of using AI to assist in these crucial aspects of scientific workflow is innovative and could have a substantial impact on the research community. The interactive nature of AIReviewer, which allows for multi-round discussions with authors, is a novel approach that mimics the real-world peer review process. Similarly, the debate-style conversation between two AI agents in AIResearch for idea generation is a unique method that encourages the exploration of diverse perspectives. The use of an AI4Science Reward Model, trained on preference data from AIReview, to rank scientific ideas is another creative solution that aligns the idea generation process with scientific standards. Furthermore, the paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of AIReview and AIResearch, including a large-scale human study comparing AIReview’s performance to intermediate human reviewers and benchmarks against existing models like PACCAR. The results, while not without limitations, demonstrate the potential of these AI agents to produce high-quality reviews and generate novel scientific ideas. Finally, the introduction of a benchmark dataset of AIReview reviews on ISMRL papers is a valuable contribution to the field, providing a resource for future research and development in automated scientific peer review and idea generation. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with detailed descriptions of the AIReviewer and AIResearch frameworks, the AI4Science Reward Model, and experimental setups, which makes it easy to follow the methodology and understand the findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "After a thorough examination of the paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. Firstly, the paper does not provide sufficient evidence on how well AIReviewer and AIResearch generalize to different scientific domains or complex, interdisciplinary topics. The experiments are limited to a specific set of 26 machine learning papers from the ISMRL dataset, as explicitly stated in Section 3.1, and it remains unclear if the performance would hold across diverse fields with varying methodologies and standards. For instance, fields like biomedicine or physics might present unique challenges due to their specific experimental designs and evaluation metrics. This lack of generalizability is a significant limitation, as the paper does not explore the potential challenges or adaptations needed for applying these agents to other scientific domains. Secondly, the evaluation of AIReviewer’s review quality and AIResearch’s idea novelty lacks some standard quantitative metrics. While the paper mentions comparisons to human reviews, it does not specify the metrics used for these comparisons, making it difficult to assess the robustness of the evaluation. For AIReview, the paper uses the percentage of human evaluators who prefer reviews from AIReview, Human Reviewers, or are Indifferent (Figure 2 caption) and agreement rate on the best idea, and an average agreement rate across all ideas (Section 3.5). However, it lacks standard quantitative metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score for review quality. Similarly, for AIResearch, the paper uses Importance, Feasibility, and Novelty (rated on a scale of 1-9), and Generation Time (measured in seconds) (Table 1 caption), but it does not include diversity metrics for idea novelty. The absence of these standard metrics makes it hard to validate the claims and objectively assess the performance of the proposed agents. Furthermore, the paper does not fully address the potential biases that might be present in the training data for the AI4Science Reward Model. The reward model is trained on preference data from AIReview, which may inherit biases from the LLM used to generate the reviews, as stated in Section 2.3. This could lead to a reinforcement of existing biases in the scientific literature, rather than a neutral evaluation. The paper does not include any analysis or discussion about potential biases in the AIReview-generated preference data used to train the AI4Science Reward Model. Additionally, the experiments are conducted on a relatively small dataset of 26 papers, which may not be representative of the broader range of scientific research. This limited dataset size raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings and the robustness of the models. The paper explicitly states that the experiments are conducted on machine learning papers from the ISMRL dataset (Section 3.1), and there is no discussion about the limitations of using a small dataset or the potential impact on generalizability. Finally, the paper does not discuss the computational resources required for training and deploying AIReviewer and AIResearch, which could be a barrier to adoption for some researchers. While the paper mentions using DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 1 and F8 Quantization for training the AI4Science Reward Model (Section 3.3), it lacks details on hardware, training time, and inference costs for either AIReview or AIResearch. The lack of information on the hardware requirements, training time, and inference latency of the models makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed systems. These weaknesses, all of which I have directly verified from the paper, significantly impact the conclusions and generalizability of the research. My confidence in these identified issues is high, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and lack of discussion on these critical aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the limitations in generalizability, I recommend that the authors conduct experiments across a wider range of scientific domains, including fields such as biomedicine, physics, and social sciences. This would involve curating datasets of papers from these domains and evaluating the performance of AIReviewer and AIResearch. The evaluation should also consider the specific challenges of each domain, such as different experimental designs, evaluation metrics, and terminology. For example, in biomedicine, the focus might be on the validity of clinical trials and the interpretation of statistical results, while in physics, the emphasis might be on the theoretical soundness and experimental reproducibility. Furthermore, the authors should explore how the models handle interdisciplinary research, which often combines methodologies and concepts from multiple fields. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the proposed systems. To improve the evaluation of AIReviewer and AIResearch, the authors should incorporate standard quantitative metrics for review quality and idea novelty. For review quality, metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score could be used to assess the accuracy of the reviews in identifying strengths, weaknesses, and potential errors in the papers. The authors should also consider using metrics that measure the clarity, coherence, and constructiveness of the reviews. For idea novelty, metrics such as the number of novel concepts generated, the diversity of the generated ideas, and the impact of the ideas on the scientific community could be used. The authors should also explore the use of human evaluation to validate the quantitative metrics and provide a more comprehensive assessment of the quality and novelty of the reviews and ideas. This would involve having expert reviewers assess the reviews and ideas generated by the AI systems and compare them to human-generated reviews and ideas. To address the potential biases in the training data for the AI4Science Reward Model, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of the training data used for AIReviewer, identifying any potential biases that may be present. They should also evaluate the performance of AIReviewer on edge cases, such as interdisciplinary research or papers that challenge established paradigms. This evaluation should include a qualitative analysis of the reviews generated by AIReviewer, focusing on the fairness and objectivity of the feedback. The authors should also explore techniques to mitigate bias in the training data, such as data augmentation or adversarial training. Furthermore, the authors should consider incorporating human oversight into the review process, allowing human reviewers to validate and refine the feedback provided by AIReviewer. This would help to ensure the fairness and accuracy of the reviews, while also providing a valuable learning opportunity for human reviewers. Finally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the iterative process between AIReviewer and human authors. This should include a description of the specific types of feedback provided by AIReviewer, as well as the mechanisms for human authors to refine and improve the generated reviews. The authors should also conduct a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the iterative process, focusing on the quality of the reviews generated by the system and the satisfaction of the human authors. This user study should include both expert and novice reviewers to assess the usability of the system across different levels of expertise. The authors should also explore the use of different prompting strategies to improve the quality of the generated reviews and to encourage critical thinking and creativity in the review process. In addition, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for training and deploying AIReviewer and AIResearch, including the hardware requirements, training time, and inference costs. This would help researchers assess the practical feasibility of the proposed systems and make informed decisions about their adoption. The authors should also explore techniques to reduce the computational cost of the models, such as model compression or quantization, to make them more accessible to researchers with limited resources.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for further understanding and development of this research. Firstly, how well do AIReviewer and AIResearch generalize to different scientific domains or complex, interdisciplinary topics? The experiments are limited to a specific set of machine learning papers, and it is unclear if the performance would hold across diverse fields with varying methodologies and standards. Secondly, what specific quantitative metrics were used to evaluate the quality of AIReview’s reviews and the novelty of AIResearch’s generated ideas? The paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the evaluation criteria and how they compare to human-generated reviews and ideas. Thirdly, how does the AI4Science Reward Model account for potential biases in the training data, and what measures are in place to ensure fairness and objectivity in the reviews and ideas generated? Fourthly, given the relatively small dataset of 26 papers used in the experiments, how confident are the authors in the generalizability of their findings? Would the models’ performance improve with a larger, more diverse dataset? Fifthly, what are the computational requirements for training and deploying AIReviewer and AIResearch? This information would be valuable for researchers considering adopting these tools, especially those with limited computational resources. Sixthly, how does the system ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the peer review process when using AIReviewer, given the sensitivity of scientific reviews? Seventhly, what measures are in place to prevent the perpetuation of existing biases in scientific literature through the AI-generated reviews and ideas? Eighthly, how does the debate-style conversation in AIResearch contribute to the novelty and quality of generated scientific ideas compared to single-agent idea generation? Ninthly, can the AI4Science Reward Model be adapted to evaluate ideas in scientific domains beyond machine learning, and how would its performance vary across different fields? Finally, how does the system handle disagreements or conflicts that may arise during the multi-round review process with AIReviewer? These questions target the core methodological choices, assumptions, and limitations of the study, and I believe addressing them would significantly enhance the robustness and applicability of the proposed AI agents.\n",

      "1. The paper lacks a clear explanation of the \"two-player zero-sum game\" concept, which is central to the PAIR framework. The description of the critic and reviewer agents, including their specific roles, training methodologies, and interaction protocols, is insufficient. It is unclear how these agents are implemented, what algorithms are used for their training, and how they interact within the proposed framework. The paper needs to provide a more detailed explanation of the mechanisms that drive the agents' behavior and their interplay.\n",
      "2. The paper does not provide sufficient details on the fine-tuning process of the specialized model. Specifically, the architecture of the model, the size of the dataset used for fine-tuning, and the hyperparameter settings are not clearly stated.

The authors should also clarify how the critic and reviewer agents interact within this game, and how their interactions lead to improved review quality. A concrete example of a review scenario, illustrating the agents' interactions and the resulting improvements, would be beneficial.

The authors should also explain the rationale behind the choices made for the model architecture and the hyperparameter settings.

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel framework, termed PAIR (Peer Review as Iterative Refinement), designed to enhance the quality of scientific peer reviews using large language models (LLMs). The core idea of PAIR is to simulate the iterative nature of peer review through a two-agent system: a critic LLM and a reviewer LLM. The critic provides feedback on the reviewer's initial review, which the reviewer then uses to refine and improve their assessment. This process is framed as a two-player zero-sum game, although the specifics of this game-theoretic formulation are not fully elaborated. The authors explore different feedback modes for the critic, including ranking, rejection, and construction, and evaluate the impact of these modes on the quality of the generated reviews. They also investigate the use of reinforcement learning and preference tuning to further enhance the performance of both the critic and reviewer agents. The experimental evaluation primarily focuses on papers from the AI Index 2023 Annual Report, with a specialized model fine-tuned on high-quality reviews from the Computer Physics Communications (CPC) journal. The results indicate that the PAIR framework can generate feedback that is comparable to human reviewers, with the GPT-4L model achieving a significant improvement in usefulness score after iterative refinement. The paper's main contribution lies in its innovative approach to simulating peer review using LLMs and its demonstration of the potential for iterative refinement to enhance the quality of AI-generated reviews. However, the paper also has several limitations, particularly in the clarity of its methodological details and the scope of its experimental evaluation, which I will discuss in detail below. Overall, the paper presents a promising direction for using LLMs to assist in the peer review process, but further work is needed to address the identified weaknesses and fully realize the potential of the PAIR framework.\n",

      "The most compelling strength of this paper is the introduction of the PAIR framework, which offers a novel and potentially transformative approach to scientific peer review. The idea of using a two-agent system, with a critic and a reviewer LLM, to simulate the iterative nature of the review process is both innovative and intuitively appealing. The framework's ability to generate feedback that is comparable to human reviewers, as demonstrated by the experimental results, is a significant achievement. The use of iterative refinement, where the reviewer agent incorporates feedback from the critic agent to improve the quality of its reviews, is a key strength of the approach. The exploration of different feedback modes for the critic agent, including ranking, rejection, and construction, also contributes to the paper's novelty. Furthermore, the authors' efforts to fine-tune a specialized model on high-quality reviews from the Computer Physics Communications journal demonstrate a commitment to improving the performance of the PAIR framework. The experimental results, particularly the improvement in the usefulness score of GPT-4L after iterative refinement, provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper also explores the use of reinforcement learning and preference tuning to enhance the performance of the LLM agents, which is a valuable contribution to the field. The paper's focus on improving the quality of AI-generated reviews is particularly relevant in the context of the increasing use of LLMs in scientific research. The authors' efforts to address the limitations of existing LLM-based review systems by incorporating iterative refinement and a critic agent are commendable. The paper is also well-written and easy to understand, which makes it accessible to a broad audience. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the PAIR framework and the experimental setup, and the results are presented in a clear and informative manner. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its innovative approach to simulating peer review using LLMs, its demonstration of the potential for iterative refinement to enhance the quality of AI-generated reviews, and its clear and accessible presentation.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "While the paper presents a promising approach to enhancing peer review with LLMs, several weaknesses need to be addressed. First, the paper lacks a clear and detailed explanation of the \"two-player zero-sum game\" concept, which is central to the PAIR framework. While the paper introduces the concept in the \"Problem Formulation\" section, it does not provide a formal definition of the game, the payoff functions for each agent, or the equilibrium conditions. The description of the critic and reviewer agents, including their specific roles, training methodologies, and interaction protocols, is also insufficient. It is unclear how these agents are implemented, what algorithms are used for their training, and how they interact within the proposed framework. The paper mentions reinforcement learning but does not specify the exact algorithms used for training either the critic or the reviewer agent. The interaction protocol is described in the \"Algorithm\" section, but the underlying mechanisms driving the agents' behavior are not elaborated upon. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of the PAIR framework and to reproduce the results. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not provide the necessary details to fully understand the implementation of the zero-sum game or the agent training process. Second, the paper does not provide sufficient details on the fine-tuning process of the specialized model, particularly the CPC agent. While the paper mentions the use of the LoRA method for fine-tuning, along with hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and LoRA dimension, it does not explicitly state the architecture of the model. It is implied that the CPC agent is a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model, but this is not explicitly stated. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the validity of the experimental results and the reproducibility of the proposed method. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper omits a key detail about the model architecture. Third, the paper's experimental evaluation is primarily limited to the Computer Physics Communications dataset and papers from the AI Index 2023 Annual Report. While the paper mentions using the ReviewGPT dataset for pretraining, the core evaluation of the PAIR framework is centered around the AI Index dataset. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method to other domains and datasets. The paper should include experiments on other datasets to demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the PAIR framework in different contexts. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's experimental evaluation is indeed primarily focused on a single dataset. Fourth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of the PAIR framework. For example, it is unclear how the framework would perform in situations where the critic agent and the reviewer agent disagree on the quality of a review. The paper does not explicitly address how the framework resolves such disagreements, or if it simply converges on a suboptimal solution. The experimental setup does not specifically test scenarios with disagreement between the agents. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not analyze the framework's behavior in disagreement scenarios. Fifth, the paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using LLMs to simulate scientific peer reviews. For example, there is a risk that the LLMs could perpetuate existing biases in the peer review process. The paper does not address the potential for the LLMs to be used for malicious purposes, such as generating fake reviews or manipulating the peer review process. It is crucial to propose concrete strategies for mitigating these risks. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper completely omits any discussion of ethical considerations. Finally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required to implement the PAIR framework. While the paper mentions the use of an A100 GPU and the training time for each model, it lacks a detailed breakdown of other computational resources like memory requirements, the number of GPUs needed for parallelization (if applicable), and energy consumption. A more comprehensive analysis of the computational cost would be beneficial for researchers considering implementing the framework. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper omits key details about the computational resources required to implement the framework.\n",

      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the \"two-player zero-sum game\" concept within the PAIR framework. This should include a formal definition of the game, the payoff functions for each agent, and the equilibrium conditions. The authors should also clarify how the critic and reviewer agents interact within this game, and how their interactions lead to improved review quality. A concrete example of a review scenario, illustrating the agents' interactions and the resulting improvements, would be beneficial. Furthermore, the paper should explicitly state the algorithms used for training each agent, including the loss functions and optimization methods. This level of detail is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the PAIR framework and for enabling other researchers to reproduce the results. Second, the authors should provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture used for the specialized model (CPC agent), including the number of layers, the size of the hidden layers, and the activation functions used. The paper should also specify the size of the dataset used for fine-tuning, the data preprocessing steps, and the hyperparameter settings used during training. The authors should also explain the rationale behind the choices made for the model architecture and the hyperparameter settings. Additionally, the paper should include a discussion of the potential limitations of the fine-tuning process, such as overfitting or bias, and how these limitations were addressed. This level of detail is essential for ensuring the reproducibility of the results and for enabling other researchers to build upon the proposed method. Third, to address the concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method, the authors should include experiments on other datasets, ideally from different domains. This would demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the PAIR framework in different contexts. The paper should also provide a more detailed analysis of the experimental results, including a comparison with existing methods and a discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach. The authors should also consider conducting an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component of the PAIR framework. This would provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the proposed method and would help to identify areas for future improvement. Fourth, the authors should delve deeper into the potential failure modes of the PAIR framework, particularly when the critic and reviewer agents produce conflicting assessments. A more rigorous analysis is needed to understand how the framework resolves such disagreements, or if it simply converges on a suboptimal solution. For instance, the authors could explore scenarios where the critic agent is overly critical or lenient, and how this impacts the reviewer agent's learning process. It would be beneficial to include experiments that specifically test the framework's robustness to such imbalances, perhaps by introducing adversarial critic agents or by manipulating the training data to create biased critics. Furthermore, the paper should investigate the impact of different feedback mechanisms on the convergence and quality of the reviews. A detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the framework to various hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the number of iterations, would also be valuable. Fifth, to address the ethical concerns, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of potential biases in the training data and the generated reviews. This should include an investigation into whether the LLMs perpetuate existing biases related to gender, race, or institutional affiliation. The paper should also discuss the potential for the LLMs to be used for malicious purposes, such as generating fake reviews or manipulating the peer review process. It is crucial to propose concrete strategies for mitigating these risks, such as incorporating fairness constraints into the training process or developing methods for detecting and filtering out biased reviews. The authors should also consider the broader implications of using LLMs in scientific peer review, such as the potential impact on the careers of early-career researchers and the overall integrity of the scientific process. A discussion of these broader societal implications is essential for responsible innovation. Finally, the paper needs to provide a more detailed breakdown of the computational resources required to implement the PAIR framework. This should include not only the total training time but also the memory requirements, the number of GPUs needed, and the energy consumption. The authors should also discuss the scalability of the framework, and whether it can be used for large-scale peer review tasks. It would be useful to provide a comparison of the computational costs of the PAIR framework with those of traditional peer review processes. This information is crucial for researchers who are considering adopting the framework in their own work, and it will help to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed approach. The authors should also discuss potential optimizations to reduce the computational burden, such as using more efficient training algorithms or smaller models.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. The paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation and appears to be an experimental study without clear motivation or significant contributions. The connection to \"scientific discovery\" feels tenuous, as the work focuses on peer review simulation rather than the discovery process itself. The claims in the introduction, particularly regarding the integration of AI in hypothesis generation, experimental design, data analysis, and peer review, are broad and not sufficiently supported by the current work, which narrowly focuses on peer review simulation. The paper does not adequately address how this simulation contributes to the broader scientific method beyond potentially improving review efficiency.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The methodology lacks sufficient detail, particularly regarding training configurations and the training process itself. While the main text mentions using DPO for training, the specifics of how the model is trained to simulate peer review are not clear. For example, the paper does not specify the loss function used, the optimization algorithm, or the specific data preprocessing steps. The description of the JSON configuration for SPRA is also too high-level, lacking details on the specific fields and how they influence the review generation process. Furthermore, it is unclear how the human feedback is quantified and incorporated into the training process beyond a high-level description of DPO.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The experimental design and results are not presented with sufficient clarity. For instance, Table 2 lacks descriptions of what each question type represents, making it difficult to interpret the results. The paper also does not provide any statistical analysis of the results, such as confidence intervals or p-values, making it difficult to assess the significance of the reported improvements. Additionally, the evaluation relies heavily on metrics that may not fully capture the quality and nuance of peer reviews. The paper does not include any analysis of the types of errors the model makes or how these errors compare to those made by human reviewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper needs a more robust theoretical framing that clearly articulates the connection between peer review simulation and the broader scientific discovery process. The introduction should be revised to more accurately reflect the scope of the work and avoid overclaiming the impact on scientific discovery. The authors should provide a clear rationale for why simulating peer review is a valuable endeavor, beyond simply automating the process. This could involve discussing the limitations of current peer review systems and how the proposed approach addresses these limitations, or how the simulation could be used to train better models for other tasks. The authors should also clarify the specific research question they are trying to answer, which currently seems to be focused on achieving high performance on the RewardBench benchmark, without a clear connection to the stated goal of enhancing scientific discovery.\n",

The paper should also clarify how human feedback is quantified and incorporated into the training process, including the specific mathematical formulation of the DPO objective function. The authors should also provide a detailed explanation of the convergence criteria used for the iterative training process, including how the human evaluators assess the quality of the generated reviews and how this assessment is used to determine when the model has converged.

      "This paper proposes a Scientific Peer Reviewer Agent (SPRA) that simulates the peer review process of scientific papers.

For example, the authors could use techniques such as data augmentation or re-weighting to balance the representation of different groups. The paper should also discuss how the models handle cases where the training data is limited or biased. Furthermore, the authors should explore the use of fairness metrics to evaluate the performance of the models across different demographic and institutional groups.

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel framework for simulating and optimizing scientific peer review using large language models (LLMs). The authors propose two main components: the Scientific Peer Reviewer Agent (SPRA), which simulates peer reviews based on a JSON configuration, and the Human-LLM Reviewer Agent (HLL-RA), which iteratively refines these simulations by incorporating human feedback to better align with human judgment. The SPRA is configured to analyze various components of a scientific paper, such as the abstract, introduction, and methodology, and to identify potential issues like statistical errors or unethical research practices. The HLL-RA then uses human feedback to select the most appropriate reviews, which are subsequently used to fine-tune the LLMs using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This iterative process aims to improve the quality and alignment of the generated reviews with human standards. The authors validate their approach through experiments on the RewardBench benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance, and by creating a new synthetic dataset (Syn-RS) of high-quality reviews rated by humans. The core contribution of this work lies in its attempt to automate and enhance the peer review process through LLMs, addressing the challenges of reviewer bias and inefficiency. The paper also introduces a new dataset, Syn-RS, which could serve as a valuable resource for future research in this area. The authors frame their work within the context of Langley's computational model, suggesting a broader aim to enhance scientific discovery through improved peer review. However, the paper's primary focus remains on the simulation and optimization of the peer review process itself, rather than directly contributing to other aspects of scientific discovery. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving high performance on the RewardBench benchmark and in generating high-quality synthetic reviews. The paper's approach of using human feedback to iteratively refine LLM-generated reviews is a practical method for improving the alignment of these models with human judgment. Overall, the paper presents a significant step towards automating and improving the scientific peer review process, but it also reveals several areas that require further investigation and refinement.\n",

      "This paper presents several notable strengths, primarily in its innovative approach to simulating and optimizing scientific peer review using LLMs. The introduction of the Scientific Peer Reviewer Agent (SPRA) and the Human-LLM Reviewer Agent (HLL-RA) represents a novel contribution to the field of automated scientific review. The SPRA's configuration, which guides the LLM to analyze different sections of a paper and identify specific issues, is a well-structured approach to simulating the peer review process. The HLL-RA, with its iterative optimization process that incorporates human feedback, is a practical method for aligning LLM-generated reviews with human judgment. The creation of the Syn-RS dataset, which includes human-rated reviews, is a valuable contribution that could serve as a benchmark for future research in this area. The paper's empirical results, particularly the state-of-the-art performance on the RewardBench benchmark, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors also provide a detailed description of the fine-tuning process, including the use of LoRA and DPO, which is beneficial for reproducibility. The paper's framing within Langley's computational model, while not fully explored, suggests a broader aim to enhance scientific discovery through improved peer review. The use of human feedback to iteratively refine LLM-generated reviews is a practical method for improving the alignment of these models with human judgment. The paper's focus on addressing the challenges of reviewer bias and inefficiency is also a significant strength, as it highlights the potential impact of this work on the scientific community. The authors' approach of using a JSON configuration for SPRA provides a structured and transparent way to guide the LLM's review process. The paper's experimental design, which includes both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, is also a strength, as it provides a comprehensive assessment of the proposed method. The authors' commitment to further investigating and addressing potential biases in their system, as mentioned in the ethics statement, is also commendable. The paper's overall contribution lies in its attempt to automate and enhance the peer review process through LLMs, which has the potential to significantly impact how scientific research is evaluated and disseminated.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its strengths, this paper exhibits several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation, and the connection to the broader concept of scientific discovery feels somewhat tenuous. While the introduction mentions Langley's computational model, the paper primarily focuses on the simulation of peer review rather than the broader scientific method. The claims in the introduction, particularly regarding the integration of AI in hypothesis generation, experimental design, and data analysis, are not sufficiently supported by the current work, which narrowly focuses on peer review simulation. The paper does not adequately address how this simulation contributes to scientific progress beyond potentially improving review efficiency. This is a partially valid concern, as the paper's primary focus is on peer review simulation, and while it aims to contribute to scientific discovery, the connection could be more explicitly and deeply explored. Second, the methodology lacks sufficient detail, particularly regarding the SPRA's JSON configuration and the precise mathematical formulation of how human feedback is integrated into the DPO framework. While the paper mentions using DPO for training, the specifics of how the model is trained to simulate peer review are not entirely clear. The description of the JSON configuration for SPRA is also too high-level, lacking details on the specific fields and how they influence the review generation process. Furthermore, it is unclear how the human feedback is quantified and incorporated into the training process beyond a high-level description of DPO. This is a partially valid concern, as the paper provides some methodological details, especially regarding fine-tuning, but lacks fine-grained specifics on the SPRA JSON configuration and the precise mathematical formulation of how human feedback is integrated into DPO. Third, the experimental design and results are not presented with sufficient clarity. Table 2 lacks descriptions of what each question type represents, making it difficult to interpret the results. The paper also does not provide any statistical analysis of the results, such as confidence intervals or p-values, making it difficult to assess the significance of the reported improvements. Additionally, the evaluation relies heavily on metrics that may not fully capture the quality and nuance of peer reviews. The paper does not include any analysis of the types of errors the model makes or how these errors compare to those made by human reviewers. This is a valid concern, as the experimental design and results presentation lack clarity due to missing question type descriptions, absence of statistical analysis, and limited error analysis. Fourth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for training and deploying the SPRA and HLL-RA models. While the paper mentions the hardware used (4 RTX 4090 servers with 4 GPUs each) and the training duration (3 epochs), it does not explicitly state the training time per epoch, memory usage, or energy consumption. This is a partially valid concern, as the paper provides some hardware details but lacks specifics on training time per epoch, memory usage, and energy consumption. Fifth, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of potential biases in the training data and how these biases might affect the performance of the SPRA and HLL-RA models. The paper acknowledges the potential for bias in the Qwen2.5-72B-Chat model but does not include a detailed analysis of biases in the training data itself. This is a valid concern, as the paper lacks a discussion and analysis of potential biases in the training data. Sixth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed method. It does not discuss the scenarios where the SPRA and HLL-RA models may not perform well, such as when evaluating interdisciplinary research or papers that challenge established paradigms. This is a valid concern, as the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed method. Finally, the paper does not compare the proposed method with other existing approaches for scientific peer review, such as traditional peer review or crowdsourced review. This is a valid concern, as the paper lacks a comparison with traditional and crowdsourced peer review methods. These weaknesses, while not invalidating the paper's contributions, highlight areas that require further investigation and refinement.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the paper needs a more robust theoretical framing that clearly articulates the connection between peer review simulation and the broader scientific discovery process. The introduction should be revised to more accurately reflect the scope of the work and avoid overclaiming the impact on scientific discovery. The authors should provide a clear rationale for why simulating peer review is a valuable endeavor, beyond simply automating the process. This could involve discussing the limitations of current peer review systems and how the proposed approach addresses these limitations, or how the simulation could be used to train better models for other tasks. The authors should also clarify the specific research question they are trying to answer, which currently seems to be focused on achieving high performance on the RewardBench benchmark, without a clear connection to the stated goal of enhancing scientific discovery. Second, the methodology section needs to be significantly expanded to provide a detailed explanation of the training process. This should include a clear description of the data used for training, the specific loss function and optimization algorithm employed, and the data preprocessing steps. The authors should also provide a detailed explanation of the JSON configuration for SPRA, including the specific fields and how they influence the review generation process. The paper should also clarify how human feedback is quantified and incorporated into the training process, including the specific mathematical formulation of the DPO objective function. The authors should also provide a detailed explanation of the convergence criteria used for the iterative training process, including how the human evaluators assess the quality of the generated reviews and how this assessment is used to determine when the model has converged. The paper should also include an ablation study to evaluate the impact of different components of the proposed approach, such as the use of human feedback and the specific training algorithm. Third, the experimental design and results need to be presented with more clarity and rigor. The authors should provide a detailed description of each question type in Table 2, including examples of the questions and how they relate to the evaluation of peer reviews. The paper should also include a statistical analysis of the results, such as confidence intervals or p-values, to assess the significance of the reported improvements. The authors should also include an analysis of the types of errors the model makes and how these errors compare to those made by human reviewers. The evaluation metrics should be carefully considered to ensure they capture the quality and nuance of peer reviews. The authors should also consider using human evaluations to assess the quality of the generated reviews, in addition to the automated metrics. The paper should also include a discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach and potential avenues for future research. Fourth, the paper should include a more detailed analysis of the computational resources required for training and deploying the SPRA and HLL-RA models. This analysis should include the number of GPUs, the training time, and the memory usage. Furthermore, the authors should provide a breakdown of the computational cost for each stage of the process, such as the initial training of the SPRA models, the iterative fine-tuning of the HLL-RA models, and the generation of reviews. This information is crucial for assessing the practicality of the approach, especially for researchers with limited computational resources. It would also be beneficial to discuss the scalability of the method and how the computational cost might change with larger datasets or more complex models. This analysis should also include a discussion of the energy consumption of the proposed method, which is an important consideration for sustainable research practices. Fifth, the paper should also include a thorough analysis of potential biases in the training data and how these biases might affect the performance of the SPRA and HLL-RA models. The authors should investigate biases related to author demographics, institutional affiliations, research topics, and other relevant factors. They should also discuss how these biases might be amplified by the models and lead to unfair or inaccurate evaluations. For example, if the training data primarily consists of reviews of papers from well-established institutions, the models might be biased against papers from less well-known institutions. The authors should also discuss mitigation strategies for addressing these biases, such as using debiasing techniques or ensuring that the training data is representative of the diversity of scientific research. A detailed analysis of the potential biases and mitigation strategies is crucial for ensuring the fairness and reliability of the proposed method. Sixth, the paper should provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed method. The authors should discuss the scenarios where the SPRA and HLL-RA models may not perform well, such as when evaluating interdisciplinary research, papers that challenge established paradigms, or papers that use novel methodologies. They should also discuss the potential for the models to be gamed or manipulated, and how this could affect the integrity of the review process. A discussion of these limitations would provide a more balanced view of the approach and help guide future research. Finally, the paper should compare the proposed method with other existing approaches for scientific peer review, such as traditional peer review or crowdsourced review. This comparison should include an analysis of the performance, cost, and limitations of each approach, and should help to contextualize the contribution of the proposed method and identify areas for improvement.\n",

The authors should also discuss the limitations of their method and potential directions for future research. For example, the authors could explore the use of different types of LLMs, the impact of different prompt designs, and the potential for using the proposed method in real-world peer review scenarios.

The authors also employ an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm to fine-tune a reward model, enhancing the accuracy of the final review. Experiments demonstrate that MARP outperforms single LLM reviews, suggesting its potential to assist and improve the peer review process in scientific research.\n",

The authors should consider using publicly available datasets of scientific papers, such as the ACL Anthology or the arXiv database, to evaluate the performance of MARP on a broader range of research areas and paper types. Additionally, the authors should explore different evaluation metrics to assess the quality of the reviews generated by MARP.

They should also explore methods for mitigating these biases, such as using debiasing techniques or incorporating fairness constraints into the optimization algorithm. Furthermore, the authors should compare the performance of MARP with other state-of-the-art methods for automated peer review or paper evaluation. This comparison would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's strengths and weaknesses and would help to establish its position in the field.

      "1. The paper lacks a comparison with other multi-agent frameworks, such as those based on game theory or distributed consensus algorithms. Specifically, the paper does not explore how MARP's performance compares to established methods for achieving convergence and optimality in multi-agent systems. For example, how does MARP's iterative refinement process compare to the convergence properties of algorithms like fictitious play or replicator dynamics, which are commonly used in game-theoretic settings? Furthermore, the paper does not discuss the potential for using techniques from distributed consensus algorithms, such as average consensus or distributed optimization, to improve the efficiency and robustness of the multi-agent review process.\n",

The paper should include a detailed analysis of the time and memory complexity of the MARP algorithm, including the cost of LLM inference, feedback generation, and iterative refinement. It is unclear how the computational cost scales with the number of agents, the length of the papers, and the number of iterations. This is a critical consideration for practical applications of the method, especially in scenarios with a large volume of submissions.\n",

For example, the authors could investigate how algorithms like fictitious play or replicator dynamics perform in the context of multi-agent review. Furthermore, the authors should consider the potential for using techniques from distributed consensus algorithms, such as average consensus or distributed optimization, to improve the efficiency and robustness of the multi-agent review process.

This analysis should be supported by empirical results, demonstrating the practical feasibility of the method for different scales of application. Furthermore, the authors should discuss potential strategies for reducing the computational cost, such as using more efficient LLM inference techniques or optimizing the iterative refinement process.

      "* **Writing Quality (Reviewer 1):**  Reviewer 1's assessment of the writing quality is valid. While the technical sections are generally understandable, the paper does suffer from instances of long and complex sentences, particularly in the introductory and descriptive parts. This impacts readability.\n",
      "* **Methodological Details (Reviewer 1):** Reviewer 1's criticism regarding the lack of technical details in the method section is also valid. The paper provides a high-level overview but lacks specific implementation details for crucial components like feedback integration, communication protocols, review evaluation criteria, and the specifics of the preference optimization algorithm. This hinders reproducibility and a full understanding of the method.\n",
      "* **Experimental Justification and Evaluation (Reviewer 1):** Reviewer 1's concerns about the experimental setup and evaluation are valid. The paper lacks explicit justifications for the choice of datasets and baselines. The evaluation metrics are limited, and there's no comparison to human reviewers or extensive testing for robustness and generalizability. This limits the ability to fully assess the effectiveness and generalizability of MARP.\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces Multi-Agent Review (MARP), a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate the traditional peer review process. The core idea is to employ multiple LLMs as independent reviewers, each providing feedback on a given research paper. These agents then iteratively refine their reviews by exchanging feedback, ultimately converging on a consensus conclusion. The authors also incorporate an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm to fine-tune a reward model, aiming to enhance the accuracy of the final review. The experimental results, conducted on a dataset of papers from NeurIPS 2021, suggest that MARP outperforms single LLM reviews, such as those generated by ChatGPT-3.5, in terms of predicting acceptance decisions. The authors propose that MARP could assist and improve the peer review process in scientific research by providing a more efficient and potentially less biased alternative to traditional methods. The methodology involves a controller agent that manages the review process, and reviewer agents that are configured with specific roles and prompts to evaluate the paper from different perspectives. The iterative feedback mechanism allows the agents to refine their evaluations based on the feedback received from other agents. The reward model is trained to assess the quality of the reviews, guiding the iterative refinement process. The paper's significance lies in its attempt to automate and improve the peer review process using LLMs, which could have implications for the efficiency and objectivity of scientific evaluation. However, the paper also has several limitations that need to be addressed to fully realize its potential.\n",

      "The core strength of this paper lies in its innovative application of multi-agent systems, specifically using multiple LLMs, to simulate the peer review process. This approach, which I've verified through the paper's method section, is a novel way to mimic the diverse perspectives and iterative refinement inherent in human peer review. The idea of having multiple LLMs independently review a paper and then provide feedback to each other is a creative and promising approach to automating this critical aspect of scientific research. The paper also introduces an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm to fine-tune a reward model, which is designed to enhance the accuracy of the final review. This iterative process, where the agents refine their understanding of the material through feedback, is a key strength of the proposed method. The authors' attempt to use LLMs to assist the review process could potentially improve the quality and efficiency of scientific peer review, which is a significant contribution. The use of different roles for the reviewer agents, such as a statistician, a domain expert, and a methodologist, is another strength, as it allows the system to evaluate the paper from multiple perspectives. The mathematical formulation of the consensus conclusion, while simple, provides a clear and concise way to aggregate the individual reviews. The paper's focus on using LLMs to address a real-world problem, such as the limitations of traditional peer review, is also commendable. The authors have identified a relevant and important problem and proposed a novel solution that has the potential to impact the way scientific research is evaluated. The paper's exploration of using LLMs to simulate human-like review processes is a valuable contribution to the field of AI in scientific discovery.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "After a thorough examination of the paper, I've identified several significant weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the writing quality, while generally understandable, suffers from instances of long and complex sentences, particularly in the introductory and descriptive sections. For example, the introduction contains sentences like, 'Building upon the foundation of deep learning and transformer architectures, large language models (LLMs) have undergone remarkable evolution. With extensive training data and computational power, LLMs have demonstrated exceptional proficiency in understanding and generating human language, leading to widespread applications across various domains.' This lack of conciseness and clarity makes the paper less accessible and can hinder the reader's understanding. This is a high-confidence issue, as it is directly observable in the text. Second, the method section lacks crucial technical details, making it difficult to fully understand and reproduce the proposed method. The description of the multi-agent review process is vague, particularly regarding the feedback integration function, denoted as `f`. The paper states that 'R_j^{t+1} = f(R_j^t, F_{ij}^t) = R_j^t + \\sum_{i \\ne j} \\mathcal{M}_{R_j}(F_{ij}^t; \\text{integrate\\_feedback})', but the exact implementation of the `integrate_feedback` process is not explicitly defined. Similarly, the communication protocols between agents are not clearly specified, and the criteria for evaluating the reviews are not formally defined. The iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm is also insufficiently described, with a lack of detail regarding the loss function and the nature of the preference labels. This lack of specificity is a high-confidence issue, as it directly impacts the reproducibility of the method. Third, the experimental setup is not well-justified, and the evaluation is limited. The paper uses papers from NeurIPS 2021, but the rationale for choosing this specific year is not explicitly stated. The comparison is primarily against ChatGPT-3.5, without a clear justification for this choice over other potential baselines. The evaluation metric is limited to the accuracy of acceptance/rejection prediction, and there is no comparison to human reviewers. Furthermore, the experiments are conducted on a small, manually selected sample of 100 papers, which may not be representative of the broader range of scientific research. This lack of justification and limited evaluation is a high-confidence issue, as it directly impacts the validity of the experimental results. Fourth, the discussion of related work is insufficient. While the paper mentions some existing approaches, it lacks a detailed comparison of MARP to these methods. The paper does not adequately contextualize MARP within the broader landscape of multi-agent systems, game theory, or distributed consensus algorithms. The discussion of limitations and future directions is also limited, lacking specific avenues for future research. This is a high-confidence issue, as it limits the understanding of MARP's novelty and potential advantages/disadvantages. Fifth, the paper does not provide access to the source code, which significantly hinders the reproducibility of the experiments and the verification of the results. This is a high-confidence issue, as the absence of code directly impacts the ability of other researchers to replicate and build upon this work. Sixth, the paper does not address the potential biases that may be present in the LLMs used for the review process. LLMs are known to reflect biases present in their training data, which could affect the fairness and objectivity of the reviews. The paper also lacks a discussion of potential biases in the reward model, which is fine-tuned using an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm. This is a high-confidence issue, as the absence of bias analysis is a significant oversight. Finally, the paper does not include a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, especially when scaling to a large number of agents or iterations. This is a high-confidence issue, as the lack of computational cost analysis is a significant limitation for assessing the practicality of MARP. These weaknesses, taken together, significantly impact the overall quality and credibility of the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should significantly revise the writing for clarity and conciseness. This includes breaking down long and complex sentences, particularly in the introductory and descriptive sections. The authors should also ensure that all technical terms are clearly defined and that the language is precise and unambiguous. Second, the method section needs to be significantly expanded to include a detailed description of the multi-agent review process. This should include a precise definition of the feedback integration function, the communication protocols between agents, and the criteria for evaluating the reviews. The authors should provide a clear and precise definition of the iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm, including the mathematical formulation and the implementation details. Third, the experimental setup needs to be more rigorously justified. The authors should provide a clear rationale for the choice of datasets, baselines, and evaluation metrics. The evaluation should be expanded to include more comprehensive metrics, such as the quality of the generated feedback, the diversity of perspectives, and the level of agreement among agents. The authors should also consider comparing the proposed method to a wider range of baselines, including human reviewers and other state-of-the-art automated peer review methods. The experiments should also be conducted on a larger and more diverse dataset of scientific papers to ensure the generalizability of the results. Fourth, the discussion of related work should be significantly expanded to include a detailed comparison of MARP to existing approaches, including those based on game theory and distributed consensus algorithms. The authors should also discuss the limitations of the proposed method and suggest specific avenues for future research. Fifth, the authors should make the source code available to the community to allow for independent verification and to facilitate further research in this area. This is a critical step for ensuring the reproducibility of the results. Sixth, the authors should include a detailed discussion of the potential biases that may be present in the LLMs used for the review process and in the reward model. The authors should investigate the potential for biases related to the authors' gender, institution, or research area. They should also explore methods for mitigating these biases, such as using debiasing techniques or incorporating fairness constraints into the optimization algorithm. Finally, the authors should include a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, including the time and memory complexity of the MARP algorithm. The authors should also investigate how the computational cost scales with the number of agents, the length of the papers, and the number of iterations. These improvements would significantly strengthen the paper and make a more meaningful contribution to the field.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",

First, how does the proposed MARP method compare to other multi-agent frameworks, such as those based on game theory or distributed consensus algorithms? I'm particularly interested in understanding how MARP's iterative refinement process compares to the convergence properties of algorithms like fictitious play or replicator dynamics. Second, what is the computational cost of the proposed method, especially when scaling to a large number of agents or iterations? I'd like to see a detailed analysis of the time and memory complexity of the MARP algorithm, including the cost of LLM inference, feedback generation, and iterative refinement. Third, how does the reward model address potential biases, and how might these biases affect the fairness of the review process? I'm curious about the specific techniques used to mitigate bias in the reward model and how the authors ensure that the model does not favor certain writing styles, research topics, or demographic groups. Fourth, how does the choice of LLM affect the performance of the proposed method? Would using a more advanced LLM lead to better results? I'm interested in understanding the sensitivity of MARP to the specific LLM used and whether there are any specific LLMs that are better suited for this task. Fifth, how does the number of agents affect the performance of the proposed method? Is there an optimal number of agents that balances performance and computational cost? I'd like to see a more detailed analysis of the impact of the number of agents on the quality of the reviews and the overall efficiency of the process. Sixth, what measures have been taken to ensure the fairness and objectivity of the reviews generated by MARP, especially considering the potential biases in LLMs? I'm interested in understanding the specific steps taken to mitigate bias and ensure that the reviews are fair and objective. Finally, how does the iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm specifically contribute to the improvement of review quality, and what are the limitations of this approach? I'd like to see a more detailed explanation of the algorithm and its limitations, as well as a discussion of alternative approaches that could be used to improve the quality of the reviews.\n",

      "1. The study tests RALS on a limited set of AI/ML papers from only three conferences, which may not fully represent the diversity and complexity of scientific publications across other fields. This limited scope raises questions about the generalizability of RALS's effectiveness on a broader range of disciplines and types of research.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. There is a risk that automated reviews might prioritize form over substance, focusing on the style and structure of the paper rather than the novelty and validity of the research. LLMs trained on large datasets might default to generating reviews that resemble successful papers without critically evaluating the science.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. There is a risk that automated reviews could introduce biases present in the training data, such as preferences for certain methodologies or institutions. Without careful evaluation, these biases could skew review outcomes and undermine the fairness of the review process.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors should consider expanding their evaluation to include a more diverse set of papers, encompassing different scientific disciplines and publication venues. This would provide a more robust assessment of RALS's generalizability and identify potential limitations in its ability to handle varied research topics and methodologies. For example, including papers from fields such as biology, chemistry, or physics, which have different conventions and standards than AI/ML, would be beneficial. Furthermore, the evaluation should not only focus on the preference of reviews but also on the accuracy of the content, ensuring that the generated reviews correctly identify the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, and do not introduce factual errors or misinterpretations. A more rigorous evaluation of the review content is needed to ensure that RALS is not just generating fluent text but also providing meaningful and accurate feedback.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the concern that RALS might prioritize form over substance, the authors should investigate methods to explicitly guide the LLM to focus on the scientific validity and novelty of the research. This could involve incorporating specific prompts or constraints that encourage the model to critically evaluate the methodology, results, and conclusions, rather than just focusing on the presentation. For example, the prompt could be modified to include specific questions about the experimental design, the statistical analysis, and the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the authors could explore techniques to evaluate the depth of the review, such as measuring the number of unique insights or the level of critical analysis provided. This would help to ensure that RALS is not just generating superficial reviews that focus on style rather than substance. The authors should also consider comparing the reviews generated by RALS with those of human experts to identify any systematic differences in the focus and content of the reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the authors need to address the potential for biases in the training data to affect the review process. This could involve conducting a thorough analysis of the training data to identify any potential biases and implementing techniques to mitigate their impact. For example, the authors could use debiasing techniques to reduce the model's preference for certain methodologies or institutions. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate the fairness of the review process by analyzing the distribution of scores across different demographic groups or research areas. This would help to ensure that RALS is not inadvertently introducing biases that could skew the review outcomes and undermine the fairness of the scientific validation process. The authors should also consider the ethical implications of using automated systems for peer review and ensure that the system is transparent and accountable.\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces RALS (Referees in AI for Scientific Peer Searer Review), an innovative system designed to automate the scientific peer review process using large language models (LLMs). The core idea behind RALS is to simulate the traditional peer review workflow through a four-stage process: reading, analyzing, launching criticisms, and self-refining. In the reading stage, the LLM processes the research paper, summarizing its key points and arguments. The analyzing stage involves a deeper examination of the paper's methodology, results, and conclusions, identifying both strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, the launching criticisms stage enables the LLM to articulate detailed and specific critiques of the paper's content. Finally, the self-refining stage allows the LLM to iteratively improve its own review by reflecting on its previous outputs and making necessary adjustments. The authors evaluate RALS on a dataset of 169 reviewed AI/ML papers from NeurIPS, ICML, and ACL, demonstrating that RALS can generate high-quality reviews that are often preferred over human reviews by both domain experts and the general public. The authors also explore the potential of RALS as a reward model for scientific discovery, suggesting that it could be used to automate scientific quality control. The paper's findings suggest that LLMs can be effectively used to automate aspects of the peer review process, potentially accelerating scientific validation and discovery. However, the authors acknowledge that further refinement and evaluation are needed to ensure that RALS complements human review without undermining the rigor of scientific validation. The paper's contribution lies in its novel approach to automating peer review and its exploration of the potential for LLMs to revolutionize scientific quality control and discovery. The authors present a compelling case for the feasibility of using LLMs to automate peer review, while also acknowledging the limitations and challenges that need to be addressed before such systems can be widely adopted.\n",

      "The primary strength of this paper lies in its innovative approach to automating scientific peer review using large language models. The RALS system, with its four-stage process, effectively simulates the key steps of traditional peer review, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to handle complex tasks like evaluating scientific research. The paper's empirical findings, based on a dataset of 169 reviewed AI/ML papers, are compelling. The fact that RALS-generated reviews are often preferred over human reviews by both domain experts and the general public suggests that the system is not only feasible but also capable of producing high-quality feedback. This is a significant achievement, as it indicates that LLMs can potentially assist in the peer review process, reducing the burden on human reviewers and accelerating the pace of scientific validation. Furthermore, the paper's exploration of RALS as a reward model for scientific discovery is a novel and promising direction. The idea that RALS could be used to automate scientific quality control and potentially even guide research efforts is intriguing and warrants further investigation. The authors' willingness to acknowledge the limitations of their work and to suggest areas for future research is also commendable. This balanced approach enhances the credibility of the paper and encourages further exploration of the potential of LLMs in scientific peer review. The paper's clear and concise writing style also contributes to its strengths, making it accessible to a broad audience. The authors effectively communicate the core concepts and findings, ensuring that the paper's contributions are readily understood. Overall, the paper presents a well-executed study with significant implications for the future of scientific peer review.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "While the paper presents a compelling case for the use of LLMs in automating peer review, several weaknesses need to be addressed. First, the study's evaluation is limited by its dataset, which consists solely of AI/ML papers from three specific conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, and ACL). This narrow focus raises concerns about the generalizability of RALS to other scientific disciplines with different writing styles, methodologies, and evaluation metrics. As the paper itself acknowledges, the performance of RALS on papers from fields such as biology, chemistry, or physics, which often have different conventions and standards than AI/ML, is unknown. This limitation is significant because it restricts the applicability of the findings and raises questions about the robustness of RALS in diverse scientific contexts. Second, there is a risk that RALS might prioritize form over substance in its reviews. While the method description mentions evaluating methodology, results, and conclusions, the lack of detailed prompt analysis and specific metrics for critical evaluation leaves room for concern that the system might focus more on the style and structure of the paper rather than the novelty and validity of the research. This is a critical issue because it could lead to reviews that are superficial and fail to identify fundamental flaws in the science. The paper does not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that RALS is capable of deeply engaging with the scientific content of the papers it reviews. Third, the paper does not fully address how RALS would handle highly specialized or interdisciplinary research, where nuanced understanding and domain-specific knowledge are crucial for a thorough review. The method relies on the LLM's pre-existing knowledge and the information contained within the paper itself, without any explicit mechanism for incorporating external domain-specific knowledge or handling highly specialized terminology. This is a significant limitation because it suggests that RALS may struggle to provide meaningful reviews for research that falls outside of the general AI/ML domain. Fourth, the paper does not adequately address the potential for biases in the training data to affect the review process. The paper mentions using pre-trained LLMs (GPT-4, Qwen2.5-72B, Mistral) but does not discuss any specific debiasing techniques applied during training or fine-tuning. The evaluation also lacks specific metrics or analyses to detect or quantify potential biases. This is a critical oversight because it raises concerns about the fairness and objectivity of RALS-generated reviews. The absence of bias analysis makes it difficult to ensure that RALS is not inadvertently introducing biases that could skew the review outcomes and undermine the fairness of the scientific validation process. Fifth, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the limitations of RALS or potential challenges in implementing it in real-world scenarios. For example, the paper does not discuss how RALS would handle papers that are outside of its training distribution, what the computational costs of running RALS on a large scale would be, or how RALS would handle cases where the review process is adversarial or strategic. This lack of analysis is a significant gap in understanding the practical applicability of RALS. Finally, the paper does not compare RALS to other existing approaches for automating scientific peer review, such as machine learning models that predict paper quality based on features like citation counts or author reputation, or approaches that use natural language processing to identify fraudulent papers. This lack of comparison makes it difficult to assess the relative contribution and advantages of RALS. The paper also fails to discuss the ethical implications of using LLMs to automate scientific peer review, such as the impact on the fairness and transparency of the review process, or how RALS would handle cases where the review process is biased or discriminatory. This lack of ethical consideration is a significant oversight, given the potential societal impact of automated peer review systems. These weaknesses, taken together, highlight the need for further research and refinement of RALS before it can be widely adopted.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, several concrete improvements can be made. First, the authors should expand their evaluation to include a more diverse set of papers, encompassing different scientific disciplines and publication venues. This would provide a more robust assessment of RALS's generalizability and identify potential limitations in its ability to handle varied research topics and methodologies. For example, including papers from fields such as biology, chemistry, or physics, which have different conventions and standards than AI/ML, would be beneficial. Furthermore, the evaluation should not only focus on the preference of reviews but also on the accuracy of the content, ensuring that the generated reviews correctly identify the strengths and weaknesses of the paper, and do not introduce factual errors or misinterpretations. A more rigorous evaluation of the review content is needed to ensure that RALS is not just generating fluent text but also providing meaningful and accurate feedback. Second, to address the concern that RALS might prioritize form over substance, the authors should investigate methods to explicitly guide the LLM to focus on the scientific validity and novelty of the research. This could involve incorporating specific prompts or constraints that encourage the model to critically evaluate the methodology, results, and conclusions, rather than just focusing on the presentation. For example, the prompt could be modified to include specific questions about the experimental design, the statistical analysis, and the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the authors could explore techniques to evaluate the depth of the review, such as measuring the number of unique insights or the level of critical analysis provided. This would help to ensure that RALS is not just generating superficial reviews that focus on style rather than substance. The authors should also consider comparing the reviews generated by RALS with those of human experts to identify any systematic differences in the focus and content of the reviews. Third, the authors need to address the potential for biases in the training data to affect the review process. This could involve conducting a thorough analysis of the training data to identify any potential biases and implementing techniques to mitigate their impact. For example, the authors could use debiasing techniques to reduce the model's preference for certain methodologies or institutions. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate the fairness of the review process by analyzing the distribution of scores across different demographic groups or research areas. This would help to ensure that RALS is not inadvertently introducing biases that could skew the review outcomes and undermine the fairness of the scientific validation process. The authors should also consider the ethical implications of using automated systems for peer review and ensure that the system is transparent and accountable. Fourth, the authors should include a more thorough analysis of RALS's limitations, particularly regarding its robustness to out-of-distribution papers. The current evaluation focuses on AI/ML papers, but it is unclear how RALS would perform on papers from other fields with different writing styles, methodologies, and evaluation metrics. For example, how would RALS handle a paper from theoretical physics that relies heavily on mathematical proofs, or a paper from biology that presents a novel experimental technique? The authors should consider evaluating RALS on a more diverse dataset that includes papers from different scientific disciplines. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the computational costs associated with running RALS, including the time and resources required for each stage of the review process. This is important for assessing the scalability of the approach. The authors should also explore how RALS handles adversarial or strategic reviews, where reviewers may intentionally provide misleading or unfair feedback. This could involve testing RALS on datasets that include examples of such reviews and analyzing its ability to detect and mitigate them. Fifth, to better contextualize the contribution of RALS, the paper should include a more detailed comparison to existing approaches for automating scientific peer review. While the paper mentions some related work, it does not provide a thorough analysis of how RALS compares to these methods in terms of performance, efficiency, and applicability. For example, how does RALS compare to machine learning models that predict paper quality based on features such as citation counts or author reputation? How does RALS compare to approaches that use natural language processing to identify fraudulent papers? A more detailed comparison would help to clarify the unique advantages and limitations of RALS. The authors should also discuss the potential for combining RALS with other approaches to create a more robust and comprehensive system for automating scientific peer review. Finally, the paper should address the ethical implications of using LLMs to automate scientific peer review. The authors should discuss how RALS impacts the fairness and transparency of the review process. For example, how does RALS ensure that reviews are not biased against certain groups or research areas? How does RALS handle cases where the review process is discriminatory? The authors should also discuss the potential for misuse of RALS, such as using it to generate fake reviews or to manipulate the review process. The paper should include a discussion of the safeguards that are in place to prevent such misuse. Furthermore, the authors should consider the impact of RALS on the role of human reviewers and the potential for RALS to replace human reviewers in the future. A thorough discussion of these ethical considerations is essential for ensuring that RALS is used responsibly and ethically.\n",

      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors should significantly broaden the scope of their experimental evaluation. Focusing solely on AI-related papers limits the generalizability of their findings. To address this, they should include datasets from diverse fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), and recommendation systems. This would involve not only using papers from these domains but also adapting their evaluation metrics to account for the specific nuances of each field. For example, the criteria for a good review in CV might emphasize the clarity of experimental setup and the novelty of the visual task, while in NLP, the focus might be more on the theoretical soundness and the quality of the textual data. Furthermore, the authors should justify their choice of datasets and provide a detailed analysis of how the performance of AIRA varies across these different domains. This would provide a more robust assessment of the system's capabilities and limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to expanding the domain coverage, the authors need to conduct a more thorough comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods. Simply comparing different LLMs is insufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed approach. They should include a comparison with recent peer review methods, such as those that use advanced ranking algorithms or collaborative filtering techniques. This would involve not only implementing these methods but also adapting them to the task of review generation. For example, they could explore how methods that leverage reviewer expertise or past review history perform in comparison to AIRA. Furthermore, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of their approach relative to these baselines, highlighting the specific scenarios where AIRA excels and where it falls short. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the value of their contribution.\n",

How does the note-taking agent organize and store the identified issues? What is the architecture of the feedback summarization agent, and how does it ensure that the summary is comprehensive and accurate? Furthermore, the paper should detail the prompt engineering strategies used for each agent, including examples of the prompts used and the rationale behind their design.

The paper should also discuss the potential for AIRA to be used inappropriately, such as generating fake reviews or manipulating the review process. The authors should propose safeguards to prevent such misuse, including mechanisms for detecting and mitigating bias, as well as ensuring the transparency and accountability of the review process.

      "### Summary\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper introduces the AI Reviewer Agent (AIRA), a system designed to simulate human-AI collaboration in the scientific peer review process. The authors evaluate AIRA's performance using a novel benchmark, AI Review Assessment (AIRA), which includes real-world reviews of 94 AI papers. The study compares AIRA's reviews with those of human reviewers across various academic communities, finding that AIRA's reviews are on par with human reviews in the AI domain but less preferred in other fields. The paper also contributes a dataset of over 640 reviews generated by both human and AI for further analysis.\n",

      "\n",
      " - The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of AIRA, particularly in understanding complex technical details and providing feedback on mathematical accuracy.\n",
      "- The evaluation is limited to a single case study (ICML 2024), which may not be representative of other conferences or journals.\n",
      "- The paper does not fully explore the potential biases that may be introduced by the training data or the alignment techniques used.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper should delve deeper into the specific challenges AIRA faces when evaluating technically complex papers. For instance, the system's ability to understand nuanced mathematical arguments or identify subtle flaws in algorithmic design needs further investigation. The current evaluation seems to focus on more general aspects of review quality, but a more granular analysis of AIRA's performance on papers with high technical depth would be beneficial. This could involve categorizing papers based on their technical complexity and analyzing AIRA's performance across these categories. Furthermore, the paper should explore methods to improve AIRA's ability to handle such complex scenarios, perhaps by incorporating techniques like symbolic reasoning or formal verification into the system's architecture. This would not only enhance the system's capabilities but also provide a more comprehensive understanding of its limitations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the limitation of the single case study, the authors should consider expanding their evaluation to include a more diverse set of conferences and journals. This would help to assess the generalizability of AIRA's performance across different academic communities and review cultures. For example, comparing AIRA's performance on conferences with different review formats (e.g., short papers, long papers, workshops) or different levels of technical specialization would provide valuable insights. Additionally, the authors could explore the impact of different review guidelines and expectations on AIRA's performance. This would involve adapting AIRA to different review formats and guidelines and evaluating its performance in these new contexts. Such an analysis would help to determine the robustness of AIRA and its potential for broader adoption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the paper needs a more thorough investigation into the potential biases that may be present in the training data and the alignment techniques used. The authors should analyze the demographics and backgrounds of the human reviewers whose reviews were used for training, as well as the types of papers they reviewed. This analysis could reveal potential biases related to specific research areas, methodologies, or demographic groups. Furthermore, the authors should explore the impact of different alignment techniques on the fairness and objectivity of AIRA's reviews. This could involve comparing different alignment methods and evaluating their impact on the diversity and inclusivity of the generated reviews. The authors should also consider using techniques like adversarial training to mitigate potential biases and ensure that AIRA provides fair and objective reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Questions\n",
      "\n",
      "- How does AIRA handle papers that are outside of its training data or that challenge established paradigms?\n",
      "- What measures are in place to ensure the honesty and integrity of AI reviewers, and how can they be prevented from gaming the evaluation process?\n",
      "- How does the performance of AIRA vary across different academic communities and disciplines?\n",

      "    - **Analyze literature gaps:** Check if the paper misses citations for key concepts or comparisons with relevant baselines.\n",
      "    - **Synthesize the evidence and conclude:** Based on the evidence, determine if the weakness is valid, partially valid, or invalid.\n",

      "This paper introduces the AI Reviewer Agent (AIRA), a system designed to simulate human-AI collaboration in the scientific peer review process. The authors propose AIRA as a means to address the challenges of reviewer fatigue and potential biases in the traditional peer review system, which has been strained by the increasing volume of research papers, particularly in the field of deep learning. AIRA operates through a multi-agent framework consisting of a reading agent, a note-taking agent, a feedback summarization agent, and a review generating agent. These agents work sequentially, processing the paper and generating a review. The authors also introduce the AI Review Assessment (AIRA) benchmark, a dataset of over 640 reviews of 94 AI papers from the ICML 2024 conference, which includes both human and AI-generated reviews. This benchmark is intended to facilitate the evaluation of AI reviewer agents. The evaluation process involves a multi-round assessment, where AI-generated reviews are compared to human reviews using a multiple-choice questionnaire. The results indicate that AI reviews improve significantly between rounds, and in some cases, are rated higher than human reviews, particularly by authors. The authors also find that AI reviews tend to be more detailed and specific. The paper's core contribution lies in the introduction of AIRA and the AIRA benchmark, which provides a valuable resource for the research community. The study highlights the potential of AI to assist in the peer review process, demonstrating that AI reviewers can generate high-quality reviews and improve over time. However, the paper also acknowledges the limitations of AIRA, particularly in understanding complex technical details and providing feedback on mathematical accuracy. The authors also note the potential for AI reviewers to introduce biases and the need for further research in this area. Overall, this paper presents a significant step towards automating the peer review process, offering a novel approach to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific peer review.\n",

      "\n",
      "I find several strengths in this paper, primarily in its novel approach to addressing a significant challenge in the academic community. The introduction of the AI Reviewer Agent (AIRA) is a notable contribution, as it attempts to simulate human-AI collaboration in the peer review process. This is a timely and relevant problem, given the increasing volume of research papers and the limitations of the traditional peer review system. The multi-agent framework, consisting of reading, note-taking, feedback summarization, and review generating agents, is a well-structured approach that mimics the human review process. The use of a modular system allows for flexibility and adaptability, which is a strength. The paper also contributes a valuable dataset of over 640 reviews of 94 AI papers from the ICML 2024 conference. This dataset, which includes both human and AI-generated reviews, is a significant resource for the research community and can facilitate further studies on AI-assisted peer review. The authors' decision to make this dataset publicly available is commendable and will undoubtedly benefit other researchers in the field. The multi-round evaluation is another strength of the paper. By comparing AI-generated reviews with human reviews over multiple rounds, the authors demonstrate the potential for AI reviewers to improve over time. This is an important finding, as it suggests that AI reviewers can learn from their mistakes and generate better reviews with more experience. The results of the human evaluation, where the best AI reviews are rated higher than the worst human reviews, are also noteworthy. This finding suggests that AI reviewers have the potential to generate high-quality reviews that are on par with or even better than human reviews. The authors also highlight the fact that AI reviews tend to be more detailed and specific, which is a positive aspect of their approach. Finally, the paper's focus on a practical application of AI in a real-world scenario is a strength. The authors are not just proposing a theoretical concept but are actually implementing and evaluating a system that could potentially improve the peer review process. This practical focus makes the paper more relevant and impactful.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, while the paper describes the methodology, it lacks a detailed explanation of the specific algorithms and techniques used to implement each of the four agents. The paper mentions the use of prompts, but the exact nature of these prompts and the rationale behind their design are not fully elaborated. For example, the paper states that the reading agent extracts key concepts, methodologies, and results, but it doesn't specify the natural language processing models used or how the note-taking agent organizes and stores the identified issues. Similarly, the feedback summarization agent's architecture and the mechanisms used to ensure comprehensive and accurate summaries are not detailed. This lack of specificity makes it difficult to fully understand the inner workings of AIRA and hinders the reproducibility of the results. This is a significant limitation, as it prevents other researchers from building upon the authors' work. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's method section lacks the necessary detail to fully understand the implementation of each agent. Second, the paper does not provide a thorough analysis of the results. While the paper presents some comparisons between AI and human reviews, a deeper dive into the specific strengths and weaknesses of AIRA in different scenarios is needed. The paper mentions that AIRA sometimes struggles to understand complex technical details and may introduce factual errors, but it doesn't provide a granular analysis of the types of errors made by AIRA. For example, the paper notes that the model may not fully grasp complex mathematical concepts and proofs, but it doesn't provide specific examples of these errors or analyze the underlying reasons. Furthermore, the paper's comparison across different academic communities is limited to high-level observations. A more detailed analysis of AIRA's performance across different domains, highlighting the specific areas where it excels and where it falls short, is needed. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's analysis section lacks the depth and granularity needed to fully understand the performance of AIRA. Third, the paper does not adequately address the potential biases and ethical considerations of using AI in the peer review process. While the paper acknowledges the potential for AI reviewers to game the evaluation process, it doesn't delve into broader ethical concerns such as fairness, transparency, and the impact on human reviewers. The paper does not discuss how AIRA handles papers from underrepresented groups or those that challenge established paradigms. The potential for AIRA to be used inappropriately, such as generating fake reviews or manipulating the review process, is also not fully explored. The paper lacks a discussion of safeguards to prevent such misuse, including mechanisms for detecting and mitigating bias, as well as ensuring the transparency and accountability of the review process. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's discussion of ethical considerations is limited and does not address the broader implications of using AI in peer review. Fourth, the evaluation is limited to a single case study (ICML 2024), which may not be representative of other conferences or journals. The paper's reliance on data from a single conference limits the generalizability of the findings. The characteristics of peer review might vary across different venues, and the paper does not explore how AIRA would perform in different contexts. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper explicitly states that the paper selection is from ICML 2024, and the lack of evaluation on other datasets limits the generalizability of the findings. Finally, the paper does not fully explore the potential biases that may be introduced by the training data or the alignment techniques used. The paper mentions using publicly available reviews from ICML 2024 for human reviews and LoRA for alignment, but it doesn't analyze how these choices might introduce biases into the AI-generated reviews. The paper does not discuss the demographics and backgrounds of the human reviewers whose reviews were used for training, nor does it explore the impact of different alignment techniques on the fairness and objectivity of AIRA's reviews. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper lacks a detailed investigation into the potential biases stemming from the training data and alignment techniques used.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the AI Reviewer Agent (AIRA) development process. Specifically, they should elaborate on the specific algorithms and techniques used to implement each of the four agents. For example, they should specify the natural language processing models used for the reading agent to extract key concepts, methodologies, and results. They should also explain how the note-taking agent organizes and stores the identified issues, and what the architecture of the feedback summarization agent is. Furthermore, the paper should detail the prompt engineering strategies used for each agent, including examples of the prompts used and the rationale behind their design. This would significantly enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the work. Second, the authors should provide a more in-depth analysis of the results. This should include a more granular analysis of the types of errors made by AIRA, categorizing them into specific error types such as factual errors, logical inconsistencies, or misunderstandings of the paper's methodology. This analysis should be accompanied by concrete examples of each error type, illustrating the nature of the mistakes made by AIRA. Furthermore, the paper should explore the reasons behind these errors, providing insights into the limitations of the current implementation. The authors should also investigate the impact of different LLMs and alignment techniques on the quality of the generated reviews, providing a more detailed analysis of the factors that influence AIRA's performance. Third, the paper needs to address the ethical implications of using AI in the peer review process. The authors should discuss the potential biases that may be introduced by the training data or the algorithms used in AIRA. For example, they should analyze the demographics and backgrounds of the human reviewers whose reviews were used for training, as well as the types of papers they reviewed. This analysis could reveal potential biases related to specific research areas, methodologies, or demographic groups. Furthermore, the authors should explore the impact of different alignment techniques on the fairness and objectivity of AIRA's reviews. The authors should also propose safeguards to prevent the misuse of AIRA, including mechanisms for detecting and mitigating bias, as well as ensuring the transparency and accountability of the review process. The paper should also discuss the potential impact of AIRA on the roles and responsibilities of human reviewers, and how the human-AI collaboration can be optimized to ensure the integrity and fairness of the peer review process. Fourth, to address the limitation of the single case study, the authors should consider expanding their evaluation to include a more diverse set of conferences and journals. This would help to assess the generalizability of AIRA's performance across different academic communities and review cultures. For example, comparing AIRA's performance on conferences with different review formats (e.g., short papers, long papers, workshops) or different levels of technical specialization would provide valuable insights. Additionally, the authors could explore the impact of different review guidelines and expectations on AIRA's performance. This would involve adapting AIRA to different review formats and guidelines and evaluating its performance in these new contexts. Finally, the authors should conduct a more thorough investigation into the potential biases that may be present in the training data and the alignment techniques used. This could involve comparing different alignment methods and evaluating their impact on the diversity and inclusivity of the generated reviews. The authors should also consider using techniques like adversarial training to mitigate potential biases and ensure that AIRA provides fair and objective reviews.\n",

      "This paper introduces a series of models called AIReviewer, AIReviewerStar, and AIReviewerPlus for automating the scientific peer review process using language models. The base AIReviewer model simulates traditional peer review through multi-turn interactions and iterative optimization. AIReviewerStar enhances review quality by aligning with human expert reviews using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). AIReviewerPlus further incorporates author feedback to optimize the review policy. The authors develop a framework and dataset to evaluate these models on tasks like paper state encoding, review criteria encoding, and review generation. Experiments show that AIReviewer can generate detailed and consistent reviews, while AIReviewerStar outperforms existing LLM-based review systems. AIReviewerPlus demonstrates potential for accelerating feedback loops between authors and reviewers.

      "Overall, the paper lacks clarity and rigorous methodology. The training process for the models is unclear, and many of the technical terms (e.g. \"order-n reasoning\") are not properly defined. The experimental setup seems somewhat ad hoc, and many important details are missing. While the topic is interesting, the current draft needs significant improvements in clarity, rigor, and evaluation before it is ready for publication. The paper would benefit from a more systematic approach to evaluation, including comparison to human-generated reviews and established metrics. The lack of precise definitions for key concepts like \"order-n reasoning\" makes it difficult to assess the novelty and technical contribution. The absence of detailed information about the training data, including its size, composition, and preprocessing steps, further hinders the reproducibility and validity of the results. The evaluation metrics used are not standard in the field, making it hard to compare the proposed approach with existing methods or human performance. The paper also lacks a clear explanation of how the AIReviewerPlus model incorporates author feedback into the review policy optimization. The description of the iterative review process is vague, and it is unclear how the model handles multiple rounds of feedback. The paper would benefit from a more detailed explanation of the experimental setup, including the specific prompts used for each task and the hyperparameter settings for the models.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the paper, the authors should begin by providing clear and precise definitions for all technical terms, especially \"order-n reasoning.\" This term, central to the proposed approach, needs a formal definition that explains its relationship to first-order and second-order reasoning. The authors should also provide a detailed description of the training data, including its source, size, preprocessing steps, and any potential biases. This information is crucial for assessing the generalizability of the results. The paper should also include a more rigorous evaluation methodology, using standard metrics for text generation tasks, such as ROUGE, BLEU, or METEOR, in addition to the current metrics. Comparing the performance of the proposed models to human-generated reviews would also be beneficial to assess the quality of the automated reviews. The authors should also provide a detailed explanation of the training process for each model, including the specific loss functions, optimization algorithms, and hyperparameter settings. The experimental setup should be described in sufficient detail to allow for reproducibility, including the specific prompts used for each task and the evaluation protocol. \n",

      "Furthermore, the authors should clarify how AIReviewerPlus incorporates author feedback into the review policy optimization. A detailed description of the feedback mechanism, including the specific types of feedback considered and how they are used to update the model's parameters, is necessary. The authors should also explain how the model handles multiple rounds of feedback and how it ensures the consistency and coherence of the reviews. The paper would also benefit from a more systematic approach to evaluation, including a comparison of the performance of the models on different types of papers and review criteria. This would help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach and to guide future research. The authors should also discuss the limitations of their approach, including the potential for bias and the challenges of handling complex and nuanced review scenarios.

For example, how do these systems handle highly specialized or novel research areas where training data may be scarce? Are there specific types of reviews or research domains where the AIReviewer systems are less effective, and how might these limitations be addressed in future work? Specifically, the paper lacks a discussion on the potential for bias in the training data to propagate through the AI-generated reviews, and how this might affect the fairness of the review process.

      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper should delve deeper into the limitations of the AIReviewer system, particularly concerning its ability to handle novel or highly specialized research areas. The authors should discuss the potential for bias in the training data to influence the AI-generated reviews, and propose methods to mitigate this risk. This could involve techniques such as data augmentation, bias detection algorithms, or incorporating human feedback into the training process. Furthermore, the paper should explore the sensitivity of the AIReviewer system to variations in input quality, such as different writing styles or levels of detail in the research papers. This could be addressed by incorporating techniques for robust text processing and normalization, or by training the system on a more diverse dataset. The authors should also consider the potential for adversarial attacks on the AIReviewer system, where malicious actors might try to manipulate the system to produce biased or unfair reviews, and propose countermeasures to prevent such attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the evaluation of AIReviewerStar and AIReviewerPlus, the paper should provide a more detailed explanation of the metrics used to assess review quality. This should include a discussion of how these metrics are calculated, and how they relate to the overall goal of improving the peer review process. The authors should also compare the performance of the AIReviewer systems to human-generated reviews, using the same metrics, to provide a baseline for comparison. This comparison should include an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the AI-generated reviews, and identify areas where further improvement is needed. The paper should also clarify how the reward function is designed to balance different aspects of review quality, such as thoroughness, objectivity, and constructiveness, and whether there are any trade-offs between these aspects.

      "1. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed AIReviewer systems. For example, how do these systems handle highly specialized or novel research areas where training data may be scarce? Are there specific types of reviews or research domains where the AIReviewer systems are less effective, and how might these limitations be addressed in future work? Specifically, the paper lacks a discussion on the potential for bias in the training data to propagate through the AI-generated reviews, and how this might affect the fairness of the review process. Furthermore, the paper does not explore the sensitivity of the AIReviewer system to variations in the input, such as different writing styles or levels of detail in the research papers, which could lead to inconsistent review quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. While the paper mentions the use of reward and feedback signals to optimize review quality, it could provide more details on the specific metrics used to evaluate the performance of AIReviewerStar and AIReviewerPlus. What quantitative measures were used to assess the improvement in review quality, and how do these measures compare to human-generated reviews? The paper should also clarify how the reward function is designed to balance different aspects of review quality, such as thoroughness, objectivity, and constructiveness, and whether there are any trade-offs between these aspects. Additionally, the paper does not discuss the potential for overfitting to the reward function, which could lead to reviews that are optimized for the metric but not necessarily for real-world utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The paper could include a more comprehensive comparison with existing LLM-based review systems. While it claims that AIReviewerStar outperforms these systems, providing a detailed analysis of the specific advantages and disadvantages of each approach would help readers better understand the contributions of this work. The comparison should include a discussion of the computational resources required by each system, as well as their scalability to large-scale review tasks. Furthermore, the paper should address the potential for the existing LLM-based systems to be fine-tuned or adapted to achieve similar performance, and what specific architectural or methodological choices of AIReviewerStar lead to its superior performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper should delve deeper into the limitations of the AIReviewer system, particularly concerning its ability to handle novel or highly specialized research areas. The authors should discuss the potential for bias in the training data to influence the AI-generated reviews, and propose methods to mitigate this risk. This could involve techniques such as data augmentation, bias detection algorithms, or incorporating human feedback into the training process. Furthermore, the paper should explore the sensitivity of the AIReviewer system to variations in input quality, such as different writing styles or levels of detail in the research papers. This could be addressed by incorporating techniques for robust text processing and normalization, or by training the system on a more diverse dataset. The authors should also consider the potential for adversarial attacks on the AIReviewer system, where malicious actors might try to manipulate the system to produce biased or unfair reviews, and propose countermeasures to prevent such attacks.\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the evaluation of AIReviewerStar and AIReviewerPlus, the paper should provide a more detailed explanation of the metrics used to assess review quality. This should include a discussion of how these metrics are calculated, and how they relate to the overall goal of improving the peer review process. The authors should also compare the performance of the AIReviewer systems to human-generated reviews, using the same metrics, to provide a baseline for comparison. This comparison should include an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the AI-generated reviews, and identify areas where further improvement is needed. The paper should also clarify how the reward function is designed to balance different aspects of review quality, such as thoroughness, objectivity, and constructiveness, and whether there are any trade-offs between these aspects. The authors should also discuss the potential for overfitting to the reward function, and propose methods to prevent this, such as regularization techniques or early stopping.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper should include a more comprehensive comparison with existing LLM-based review systems, going beyond the claim that AIReviewerStar outperforms them. This comparison should include a detailed analysis of the specific advantages and disadvantages of each approach, considering factors such as computational resources, scalability, and the ability to handle different types of research papers. The authors should also discuss the potential for the existing LLM-based systems to be fine-tuned or adapted to achieve similar performance, and what specific architectural or methodological choices of AIReviewerStar lead to its superior performance. This could involve a detailed analysis of the model architectures, training procedures, and reward functions used by each system. The paper should also address the potential for the existing LLM-based systems to be combined with the AIReviewer system to achieve even better performance, and what challenges might arise from such an integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Questions\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Could the authors elaborate on how the AIReviewer systems handle interdisciplinary research that spans multiple domains? Is there a mechanism in place to ensure that the system can effectively evaluate research that integrates concepts from different fields?\n",

      "a) Method-related Evidence:\n",
      "   - **Unclear training process:** The paper mentions training using MLE and LoRA for AIReviewer (Section 3.1), and DPO for AIReviewerStar (Section 3.2), and LoRA-DPO for AIReviewerPlus (Section 3.2). While the loss functions are provided, the specific implementation details, such as hyperparameter settings, optimization algorithms, and training epochs, are not explicitly stated.\n",
      "   - **Undefined technical terms:** The term \"order-\\(n\\)\" thinking is introduced in Section 3.1: \"During reasoning, AIReviewer employs order-\\(n\\) thinking to analyze the inputs \\(I = \\{i_1, i_2, \\ldots, i_n\\}\\) and produce a latent decision \\(d\\).\" However, the paper does not provide a formal definition of what \"order-\\(n\\)\" thinking entails or how it is implemented within the model.

      "## Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel approach to automating the scientific peer review process using large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a system called AIReviewer, which is composed of three distinct components: AIReviewer, AIReviewerStar, and AIReviewerPlus. The core idea is to leverage the capabilities of LLMs to simulate and enhance different aspects of the peer review process. AIReviewer serves as the foundational model, designed to simulate the traditional peer review process through multi-turn interactions and iterative optimization. It employs a form of 'order-n' reasoning to analyze input data and generate a latent decision, which is then used to produce a review. AIReviewerStar builds upon this foundation by incorporating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the generated reviews with human expert reviews, aiming to improve the quality and relevance of the output. Finally, AIReviewerPlus further refines the process by incorporating author feedback into the review policy optimization, using a combination of reward modeling and DPO to update the model's parameters. The authors evaluate their system on the NeurIPS 2023 dataset, demonstrating that AIReviewer can generate detailed and consistent reviews, while AIReviewerStar outperforms existing LLM-based review systems. AIReviewerPlus shows promise in accelerating the feedback loop between reviewers and authors, suggesting a shift towards a more collaborative and iterative review process. The paper's overall contribution lies in its attempt to automate and enhance the peer review process, potentially leading to more efficient and effective scientific research. The authors present a framework and dataset to evaluate these models on tasks like paper state encoding, review criteria encoding, and review generation. The experimental results, while promising, also highlight areas where further development and refinement are needed. The work aims to improve quality and efficiency of scientific research by automating aspects of peer review, and the authors suggest that their work aligns with the broader goal of creating a unified knowledge market where machines can assume traditional human roles, thereby enhancing the scientific research process. However, the paper also acknowledges the limitations of the current system and the need for further research to address these issues.\n",

      "The paper's primary strength lies in its ambitious attempt to tackle the complex and time-consuming task of scientific peer review using large language models. The development of the AIReviewer system, with its three distinct components, represents a significant step towards automating various aspects of the review process. The idea of using LLMs to simulate traditional peer review, optimize review quality through preference learning, and incorporate author feedback is both novel and potentially impactful. The authors have clearly identified a critical need in the scientific community for more efficient and effective peer review processes, and their work makes a valuable contribution towards addressing this challenge. The paper is well-structured, and the authors clearly articulate their methodology and experimental setup. The inclusion of figures and tables aids in visualizing the concepts and results, further enhancing the paper's clarity. The use of the NeurIPS 2023 dataset provides a relevant and realistic context for evaluating the proposed system. The experimental results, while not without limitations, demonstrate the potential of the AIReviewer system to generate detailed and consistent reviews. The authors also show that AIReviewerStar outperforms existing LLM-based review systems, and AIReviewerPlus shows promise in accelerating the feedback loop between reviewers and authors. The paper's attempt to address the broader goal of creating a unified knowledge market where machines can assume traditional human roles is also a noteworthy contribution. The authors have clearly articulated their vision for the future of peer review and the role that AI can play in this process. The paper also introduces a framework and dataset to evaluate these models on tasks like paper state encoding, review criteria encoding, and review generation, which is a valuable contribution to the field. The authors have also made an effort to compare their system with other LLMs, which is a good step towards demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach. Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated and technically sound approach to automating scientific peer review, and the results, while preliminary, are promising.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the paper's strengths, several weaknesses significantly impact its overall validity and the confidence I have in its conclusions. A primary concern is the lack of clarity and rigor in the methodology, particularly regarding the training process for the AIReviewer models. While the paper mentions using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for AIReviewer, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for AIReviewerStar and AIReviewerPlus, it fails to provide specific implementation details. For instance, the paper does not specify the hyperparameter settings, optimization algorithms, or training epochs used for each model. This lack of detail makes it difficult to reproduce the results and assess the robustness of the proposed approach. The paper also introduces the concept of 'order-n' reasoning, but it does not provide a formal definition or explain how it is implemented within the model. This term, central to the proposed approach, remains vague and undefined, making it difficult to understand its technical contribution. The experimental setup also lacks crucial details. While the paper describes the dataset and tasks, it does not provide specific information about the prompts used for each subtask, the exact composition of the training, validation, and test sets, or the specific configurations of the LLMs used. This lack of granularity makes it challenging to evaluate the validity of the results and the generalizability of the proposed approach. The evaluation methodology also presents several weaknesses. The paper primarily uses accuracy as a metric for classification tasks and average scores for review quality aspects. However, it does not include standard text generation metrics such as ROUGE, BLEU, or METEOR, which are commonly used in the field. This omission makes it difficult to compare the proposed approach with existing methods or human performance. Furthermore, the paper does not include a direct comparison with human-generated reviews, which is essential for assessing the quality and naturalness of the AI-generated reviews. The absence of such a comparison makes it difficult to determine whether the proposed system can truly replicate the nuances and complexities of human peer review. The paper also lacks a detailed description of the training data, including its size, composition, and preprocessing steps. This information is crucial for assessing the generalizability of the results and identifying potential biases in the dataset. The paper mentions using the NeurIPS 2023 dataset, but it does not provide specific details about the number of papers, reviews, or any preprocessing steps applied. This lack of transparency hinders the reproducibility and validity of the results. The description of how AIReviewerPlus incorporates author feedback into the review policy optimization is also vague. The paper mentions that the author provides feedback, which is used to update the review policy, but it does not explain the precise mechanism of how this feedback is translated into updates to the model's parameters or policy. The paper also lacks a clear explanation of the iterative review process, making it unclear how the model handles multiple rounds of feedback and ensures the consistency and coherence of the reviews. Finally, the paper does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed approach, such as the potential for bias in the training data to propagate through the AI-generated reviews, and the challenges of handling complex and nuanced review scenarios. The lack of a detailed comparison with existing LLM-based review systems also makes it difficult to assess the specific advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach. While the paper claims that AIReviewerStar outperforms existing systems, it does not provide a detailed analysis of the specific architectural or methodological choices that lead to this superior performance. These weaknesses, taken together, significantly impact the paper's overall validity and the confidence I have in its conclusions. The lack of clarity, rigor, and transparency in the methodology and evaluation makes it difficult to assess the true potential of the proposed AIReviewer system.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete and actionable improvements. First and foremost, the authors should provide clear and precise definitions for all technical terms, especially 'order-n' reasoning. This term, central to the proposed approach, needs a formal definition that explains its relationship to first-order and second-order reasoning. The authors should also provide a detailed description of the training process for each model, including the specific loss functions, optimization algorithms, hyperparameter settings, and training epochs. This information is crucial for reproducibility and for assessing the robustness of the proposed approach. The experimental setup should be described in sufficient detail to allow for reproducibility, including the specific prompts used for each task, the exact composition of the training, validation, and test sets, and the specific configurations of the LLMs used. The authors should also provide a detailed description of the training data, including its source, size, preprocessing steps, and any potential biases. This information is crucial for assessing the generalizability of the results. The paper should also include a more rigorous evaluation methodology, using standard metrics for text generation tasks, such as ROUGE, BLEU, or METEOR, in addition to the current metrics. Comparing the performance of the proposed models to human-generated reviews would also be beneficial to assess the quality of the automated reviews. The authors should also clarify how AIReviewerPlus incorporates author feedback into the review policy optimization. A detailed description of the feedback mechanism, including the specific types of feedback considered and how they are used to update the model's parameters, is necessary. The authors should also explain how the model handles multiple rounds of feedback and how it ensures the consistency and coherence of the reviews. The paper would also benefit from a more systematic approach to evaluation, including a comparison of the performance of the models on different types of papers and review criteria. This would help to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach and to guide future research. The authors should also discuss the limitations of their approach, including the potential for bias and the challenges of handling complex and nuanced review scenarios. Finally, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the results, including a discussion of the types of errors made by the models and the factors that contribute to their performance. The authors should also include a more comprehensive comparison with existing LLM-based review systems, going beyond the claim that AIReviewerStar outperforms them. This comparison should include a detailed analysis of the specific advantages and disadvantages of each approach, considering factors such as computational resources, scalability, and the ability to handle different types of research papers. The authors should also discuss the potential for the existing LLM-based systems to be fine-tuned or adapted to achieve similar performance, and what specific architectural or methodological choices of AIReviewerStar lead to its superior performance. This could involve a detailed analysis of the model architectures, training procedures, and reward functions used by each system. The paper should also address the potential for the existing LLM-based systems to be combined with the AIReviewer system to achieve even better performance, and what challenges might arise from such an integration. By addressing these points, the authors can significantly improve the clarity, rigor, and validity of their work.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Several key uncertainties remain after my analysis of the paper, and I believe addressing these questions would significantly enhance its overall quality. First, I am curious about the specific implementation of 'order-n' reasoning. The paper introduces this concept but does not provide a formal definition or explain how it is implemented within the model. I would like to know how this 'order-n' reasoning is different from traditional reasoning methods and how it contributes to the performance of the AIReviewer system. Second, I am interested in the details of the training process for AIReviewerStar. The paper mentions using DPO, but it does not specify the hyperparameter settings, optimization algorithms, or training epochs used. I would like to know how the DPO loss function is specifically applied and how the model is optimized for review quality. Third, I am curious about the specific types of feedback considered in AIReviewerPlus. The paper mentions that the author provides feedback, but it does not detail the specific types of feedback used (e.g., textual comments, ratings, suggestions). I would like to know how this feedback is translated into updates to the model's parameters or policy and how the model handles multiple rounds of feedback. Fourth, I am interested in the performance of the proposed system on different types of papers and review criteria. The paper evaluates the system on the NeurIPS 2023 dataset, but it does not analyze the performance on different subfields or review criteria. I would like to know how the system performs on different types of papers and whether it is more effective for certain types of reviews. Fifth, I am curious about the potential for bias in the training data to propagate through the AI-generated reviews. The paper does not address this issue, and I would like to know how the authors plan to mitigate this risk. Finally, I am interested in the computational resources required by the AIReviewer system. The paper does not provide details about the computational resources needed to train and run the models, and I would like to know how scalable the proposed approach is and whether it can be used in real-world scenarios. These questions target core methodological choices and seek clarification of critical assumptions, and I believe that addressing them would significantly improve the paper's overall quality and impact.\n",

      "Originality: The paper presents an approach by combining single-agent and multi-agent simulations to create a comprehensive dataset that closely resembles real-world peer reviews. The two-stage training approach, involving supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, is a novel application in the context of peer review simulation.\n",
      "\n",

      "Dataset Limitations: The SimPEER dataset is based solely on NeurIPS and ICLR papers, which may limit the generalizability of the findings to other domains or types of scientific research. Including papers from a wider range of conferences or journals could enhance the robustness and applicability of the dataset.\n",
      "\n",
      "Single-Metric Optimization: The preference optimization is primarily based on human preferences for review quality. However, peer review is a multifaceted process that involves various factors, including ethical considerations, potential biases, and the significance of the research. A more comprehensive approach that incorporates multiple metrics and dimensions of peer review could provide a more balanced and accurate optimization of the AI agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lack of Error Analysis: While the paper provides quantitative evaluations of the AI agent's performance, it lacks a detailed error analysis that could offer insights into the types of mistakes the model makes and areas for improvement. An in-depth error analysis could help identify specific challenges in simulating peer review and guide future research in addressing these issues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Limited Discussion on Ethical Implications: The paper briefly mentions the potential for biases in peer review but does not delve into a detailed discussion of the ethical implications of using LLMs in this context. Issues such as fairness, accountability, and transparency are crucial when deploying AI in peer review processes. A more thorough exploration of these ethical considerations would strengthen the paper's contribution to the field.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The dataset limitations are a significant concern, as the current dataset's reliance on NeurIPS and ICLR papers may not capture the diversity of peer review practices across different scientific fields. To address this, future work should consider expanding the dataset to include papers from a broader range of conferences and journals, encompassing various disciplines such as computer vision, natural language processing, and statistical methodology. This expansion should not only include different topics but also different review formats and expectations. For example, some fields may emphasize practical applications while others focus on theoretical contributions, and these differences should be reflected in the simulated reviews. Furthermore, the dataset should include papers with varying levels of impact and citation counts to ensure the model is robust to different types of research outputs. This would make the findings more generalizable and applicable to a wider range of scientific research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding the single-metric optimization, the current approach of using human preferences for review quality as the primary optimization target is insufficient to capture the multifaceted nature of peer review. Future work should explore a more comprehensive set of metrics that incorporate various dimensions of review quality, such as clarity, constructiveness, and ethical considerations. For example, the model should be evaluated on its ability to identify potential ethical issues, such as data misuses or plagiarism, and its capacity to provide balanced feedback that considers both the strengths and weaknesses of a paper. Additionally, the model should be assessed on its ability to identify potential biases in the reviewed work, such as gender or institutional biases. This could be achieved by incorporating metrics that measure the diversity of the feedback and the fairness of the evaluation. The optimization process should also consider the significance of the research, ensuring that the model can distinguish between incremental and groundbreaking contributions. A multi-objective optimization approach could be explored to balance these different metrics and provide a more holistic evaluation of the AI agent's performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the lack of error analysis and limited discussion on ethical implications are critical areas that need further attention. A detailed error analysis should be conducted to identify the specific types of mistakes the model makes, such as incorrect assessments of methodological soundness or flawed interpretations of results. This analysis should categorize errors into different types, such as factual errors, logical fallacies, and subjective biases, and provide insights into the underlying causes of these errors. This would help guide future research in addressing these issues and improving the model's performance. Furthermore, the paper should include a more thorough discussion of the ethical implications of using LLMs in peer review, including issues of fairness, accountability, and transparency. The potential for biases in the training data to be amplified by the model should be addressed, and methods for mitigating these biases should be explored. The paper should also discuss the potential impact of using AI in peer review on the academic community, including the potential for job displacement and the need for new skills and training.\n",

Specifically, the paper does not mention the number of annotators, their specific qualifications (e.g., number of years of experience, specific areas of expertise within ML), or the process used to ensure inter-annotator agreement. Without this information, it's hard to gauge the consistency and reliability of the human-generated preference data used for training the model.\n",
      "- The evaluation of ARA-PO's performance in identifying accept/merge decisions is limited to correlations with human opinions and expert rankings. While these metrics are useful, they do not provide a complete picture of the model's performance.

Furthermore, the paper does not provide a confusion matrix to show the types of errors the model makes (e.g., false positives, false negatives). This makes it difficult to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses in the context of decision-making.\n",
      "- The paper does not adequately address the potential biases that may be present in the SimPEER dataset and the resulting ARA-PO model.

      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the lack of detail regarding human annotators, the authors should provide a comprehensive description of their characteristics. This should include the number of annotators, their specific qualifications (e.g., years of experience, areas of expertise), and the process used to ensure inter-annotator agreement. It would be beneficial to include a table summarizing the annotators' backgrounds and experience levels. Furthermore, the authors should describe the training or instructions provided to the annotators to ensure consistency and reliability in their evaluations. This would help to establish the credibility of the human preference data used for training and evaluating the AI agent. The authors should also report metrics such as Krippendorff's alpha or Fleiss' alpha to quantify the level of agreement between annotators, which would provide a more objective measure of the reliability of the human annotations.\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the evaluation of ARA-PO's decision-making capabilities, the authors should include a more comprehensive set of metrics beyond correlation.

A confusion matrix should also be included to show the types of errors the model makes (e.g., false positives, false negatives). This would provide a more detailed understanding of the model's performance and its ability to accurately classify papers. Additionally, the authors could consider using metrics such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to evaluate the model's ability to discriminate between papers that should be accepted/merged and those that should not. This would provide a more robust evaluation of the model's decision-making capabilities.\n",

      "Finally, the authors should explicitly address the potential biases in the SimPEER dataset and the resulting ARA-PO model. This should include a discussion of the types of biases that may be present (e.g., methodological, institutional, demographic) and how these biases might affect the model's performance and fairness. The authors should also explore methods for mitigating these biases, such as using debiasing techniques during training or incorporating fairness constraints into the model's objective function. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate the model's performance on different subgroups of papers (e.g., papers from less well-known researchers, institutions, or regions) to assess whether the model exhibits any unfair or discriminatory behavior.

      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the lack of computational resource details, the authors should include a comprehensive breakdown of the hardware and software used for training and deploying the ARA-PO agent. This should include the specific GPU model(s) used, the number of GPUs in the training cluster, the training time in hours or days, the memory requirements during training and inference, and the average inference time per review. Furthermore, the authors should provide an estimate of the cost associated with training the model, which would be valuable for researchers considering replicating the study. This information should be presented in a clear and concise manner, possibly in a table, to facilitate easy understanding and comparison with other studies. This level of detail is crucial for the reproducibility and practical application of the proposed method.\n",
      "\n",
      "To mitigate the potential biases in the SimPEER dataset, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of the dataset to identify and quantify any existing biases. This analysis should include examining the distribution of papers across different subfields, institutions, and demographics. The authors should also investigate whether the dataset exhibits any preference for certain methodologies or research styles. Once these biases are identified, the authors should explore techniques to mitigate their impact on the ARA-PO agent. This could involve using data augmentation techniques to balance the dataset, or incorporating fairness constraints into the training process. The paper should also include an evaluation of the ARA-PO agent's performance across different subgroups to assess whether the agent exhibits any unfair or discriminatory behavior. This analysis should be presented with clear metrics and visualizations to demonstrate the fairness of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "To provide a more comprehensive comparison of ARA-PO, the authors should include a comparison with other state-of-the-art LLMs and AI review agents. This comparison should not only focus on the overall performance but also on specific aspects of the review process, such as the quality of the feedback, the relevance of the comments, and the ability to identify key issues in the paper. The authors should consider comparing ARA-PO with fine-tuned models on similar tasks, as well as other specialized AI review agents that have been developed. The comparison should be based on a variety of metrics, including human evaluations, automated metrics, and quantitative measures of the agent's performance. This would provide a more complete picture of the relative strengths and weaknesses of ARA-PO and its position in the broader research landscape.\n",

      "This paper introduces a novel approach to simulating and optimizing the peer review process using large language models (LLMs). The authors have created a Simulated Peer Review (SimPEER) dataset, comprising 2,000 simulated peer review interactions based on machine learning papers from NeurIPS and ICLR conferences. This dataset is a significant contribution, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluating AI-assisted review agents. The core of their methodology involves training an AI researcher agent (ARA) in two stages. First, the ARA undergoes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on high-quality simulations from the SimPEER dataset. This is followed by preference optimization (PO), where the agent is further refined using human preferences for review quality. The resulting agent, named ARA-PO, is then evaluated against commercial LLMs such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5. The empirical findings demonstrate that ARA-PO outperforms these commercial LLMs in generating high-quality reviews, as assessed by human annotators using a detailed scoring metric. Furthermore, ARA-PO shows competitive performance in identifying accept/merge decisions for ML papers, achieving results comparable to expert-based scores. The authors' work is significant because it addresses the critical challenge of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the peer review process, which is a cornerstone of scientific research. By demonstrating the potential of LLMs to generate high-quality reviews and make informed decisions, this paper contributes to the advancement of automated peer review systems, potentially accelerating the scientific discovery process. The two-stage training approach, combining supervised fine-tuning with preference optimization, is a notable methodological contribution, showcasing how simulated data and human preferences can be leveraged to enhance the performance of AI agents in complex tasks. The creation of the SimPEER dataset and the development of ARA-PO represent a substantial step forward in the application of LLMs to scientific workflows, offering a promising avenue for future research in this area.\n",

      "This paper presents several notable strengths that contribute to its overall significance and impact. First and foremost, the introduction of the Simulated Peer Review (SimPEER) dataset is a substantial contribution to the field. This dataset, comprising 2,000 simulated peer review interactions based on NeurIPS and ICLR papers, provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in developing and evaluating AI-assisted peer review systems. The dataset's size and the fact that it includes both single-agent and multi-agent simulations make it a rich and versatile resource. The authors' methodology for training the AI researcher agent (ARA) is another significant strength. The two-stage approach, involving supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by preference optimization (PO), is well-designed and effectively leverages both the simulated data and human preferences. The SFT stage allows the agent to learn from high-quality simulations, while the PO stage refines the agent's performance based on human feedback, leading to a more robust and effective model. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The ARA-PO agent outperforms commercial LLMs such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5 in generating high-quality reviews, as assessed by human annotators using a detailed scoring metric. This finding is significant because it shows that a specialized AI agent, trained on a relevant dataset and with human preferences, can surpass general-purpose LLMs in a complex task like peer review. Furthermore, the ARA-PO agent demonstrates competitive performance in identifying accept/merge decisions for ML papers, achieving results comparable to expert-based scores. This indicates that the agent is not only capable of generating high-quality reviews but also of making informed decisions about paper acceptance. The paper's focus on an important problem in scientific research, the need for efficient and effective peer review processes, is another strength. By developing an AI review agent that can assist in the peer review process, the paper contributes to the betterment of scientific research and accelerates the scientific discovery process. The combination of a novel dataset, a well-designed methodology, and strong empirical results makes this paper a valuable contribution to the field of AI-assisted scientific workflows.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "While this paper presents several strengths, there are also some notable weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. One significant limitation is the dataset's scope. The SimPEER dataset is based solely on papers from NeurIPS and ICLR conferences, as explicitly stated in the 'Datasets' section: 'We collect a total of 2,000 papers from the NeurIPS 2021-2023 and ICLR 2024 conferences.' This narrow focus raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings to other domains or types of scientific research. Different fields have varying review cultures, paper structures, and expectations, and the current dataset may not capture this diversity. This limitation is further compounded by the fact that the dataset is based on past papers, which may not reflect the current state of the field or emerging trends. The preference optimization process also presents a weakness. The paper indicates that preference optimization is primarily based on human preferences for review quality, as described in the 'Preference Optimization (PO)' section: 'For each simulation, we randomly sample two reviews. We then ask human annotators to indicate their preferences between the two reviews.' While human preference is a valuable indicator, peer review is a multifaceted process that involves various factors, including ethical considerations, potential biases, and the significance of the research. The paper does not explicitly address how these other factors are incorporated into the preference optimization process. The paper's evaluation of ARA-PO's performance in identifying accept/merge decisions is also limited. The paper states in the 'Accept/Merge Decisions' section: 'We calculate the Kendall-tau correlation between ARA-PO's opinions and the leaderboard scores.' While correlation is a useful metric, it does not provide a complete picture of the model's performance. The paper lacks a more comprehensive evaluation using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score, which are standard for classification tasks. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a confusion matrix to show the types of errors the model makes (e.g., false positives, false negatives). This makes it difficult to understand the model's strengths and weaknesses in the context of decision-making. The paper also lacks a detailed error analysis. While the paper provides quantitative evaluations of the AI agent's performance, it does not include a section dedicated to error analysis or qualitative assessment of the types of errors made by the models. This absence of error analysis makes it difficult to understand the specific weaknesses of the model and where future improvements could be targeted. The paper also provides insufficient details about the human annotators used for validation and preference optimization. The paper mentions in the 'Human Validation of SimPEER Dataset Quality' section: 'We recruit ML graduate students to be annotators.' and in the 'Human Evaluation of Review Quality' section: 'We follow the setup from \\cite{liang2024can}, where the human annotators are researchers and students at top ML labs...' While the paper mentions that each simulation is rated by three annotators, it lacks details on their specific qualifications, experience, and the process for ensuring inter-annotator agreement. This lack of detailed information about annotators makes it difficult to assess the reliability and potential biases in the human annotations. The paper also does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required to train and deploy the ARA-PO agent. The paper mentions using LoRA, DeepSpeed, and ZeRO Stage 2, but lacks information on the GPU type, number of GPUs, training time, and memory requirements. This lack of computational resource details hinders the reproducibility and practical application of the research. Finally, the paper does not adequately address the potential biases that may be present in the SimPEER dataset and the resulting ARA-PO model. The paper briefly mentions bias in the 'Limitations' section: 'Bias. Our study finds that ARA-PO's opinions of ML papers demonstrate a strong correlation with those of ML experts. However, ARA-PO may also learn the biases of the experts...' However, it lacks a detailed discussion on the types of biases present in the dataset and how they might affect the agent's performance. This is a critical oversight, as it could lead to unfair or inaccurate evaluations. These weaknesses, taken together, highlight areas where the paper could be improved to enhance its robustness and generalizability.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, several concrete improvements can be made. First, the dataset limitations should be addressed by expanding the SimPEER dataset to include papers from a broader range of conferences and journals, encompassing various disciplines such as computer vision, natural language processing, and statistical methodology. This expansion should not only include different topics but also different review formats and expectations. For example, some fields may emphasize practical applications while others focus on theoretical contributions, and these differences should be reflected in the simulated reviews. Furthermore, the dataset should include papers with varying levels of impact and citation counts to ensure the model is robust to different types of research outputs. This would make the findings more generalizable and applicable to a wider range of scientific research. Second, the preference optimization process should be enhanced by incorporating a more comprehensive set of metrics that capture the multifaceted nature of peer review. In addition to human preferences for review quality, the model should be evaluated on its ability to identify potential ethical issues, such as data misuse or plagiarism, and its capacity to provide balanced feedback that considers both the strengths and weaknesses of a paper. Additionally, the model should be assessed on its ability to identify potential biases in the reviewed work, such as gender or institutional biases. This could be achieved by incorporating metrics that measure the diversity of the feedback and the fairness of the evaluation. The optimization process should also consider the significance of the research, ensuring that the model can distinguish between incremental and groundbreaking contributions. A multi-objective optimization approach could be explored to balance these different metrics and provide a more holistic evaluation of the AI agent's performance. Third, the evaluation of ARA-PO's decision-making capabilities should be improved by including a more comprehensive set of metrics beyond correlation. Specifically, the authors should report precision, recall, and F1-score for the accept/merge decision task. A confusion matrix should also be included to show the types of errors the model makes (e.g., false positives, false negatives). This would provide a more detailed understanding of the model's performance and its ability to accurately classify papers. Additionally, the authors could consider using metrics such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to evaluate the model's ability to discriminate between papers that should be accepted/merged and those that should not. This would provide a more robust evaluation of the model's decision-making capabilities. Fourth, a detailed error analysis should be conducted to identify the specific types of mistakes the model makes, such as incorrect assessments of methodological soundness or flawed interpretations of results. This analysis should categorize errors into different types, such as factual errors, logical fallacies, and subjective biases, and provide insights into the underlying causes of these errors. This would help guide future research in addressing these issues and improving the model's performance. Fifth, the paper should provide more details about the human annotators used for validation and preference optimization. This should include the number of annotators, their specific qualifications (e.g., years of experience, areas of expertise), and the process used to ensure inter-annotator agreement. It would be beneficial to include a table summarizing the annotators' backgrounds and experience levels. Furthermore, the authors should describe the training or instructions provided to the annotators to ensure consistency and reliability in their evaluations. This would help to establish the credibility of the human preference data used for training and evaluating the AI agent. The authors should also report metrics such as Krippendorff's alpha or Fleiss' alpha to quantify the level of agreement between annotators, which would provide a more objective measure of the reliability of the human annotations. Sixth, the paper should include a detailed analysis of the computational resources required to train and deploy the ARA-PO agent. This should include the specific GPU model(s) used, the number of GPUs in the training cluster, the training time in hours or days, the memory requirements during training and inference, and the average inference time per review. Furthermore, the authors should provide an estimate of the cost associated with training the model, which would be valuable for researchers considering replicating the study. Finally, the paper should explicitly address the potential biases in the SimPEER dataset and the resulting ARA-PO model. This should include a discussion of the types of biases that may be present (e.g., methodological, institutional, demographic) and how these biases might affect the model's performance and fairness. The authors should also explore methods for mitigating these biases, such as using debiasing techniques during training or incorporating fairness constraints into the model's objective function. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate the model's performance on different subgroups of papers (e.g., papers from less well-known researchers, institutions, or regions) to assess whether the model exhibits any unfair or discriminatory behavior. This would help to ensure that the model is not only accurate but also fair and unbiased.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Several questions arise from my analysis of this paper, focusing on key uncertainties and methodological choices. First, how were the human annotators selected, and what measures were taken to ensure their expertise and minimize potential biases in their annotations? The paper mentions using ML graduate students and researchers, but it lacks details on their specific qualifications, experience, and the process for ensuring inter-annotator agreement. Understanding the annotators' background and the measures taken to ensure consistency is crucial for assessing the reliability of the human preference data. Second, how do you plan to address the potential biases in the SimPEER dataset and the resulting ARA-PO model? Have you considered evaluating the model's performance on different subgroups of papers to assess fairness? The paper acknowledges the potential for bias but does not provide a detailed analysis of the types of biases present in the dataset or how they might affect the agent's performance. Understanding the specific biases and the methods for mitigating them is essential for ensuring the fairness and reliability of the model. Third, can you elaborate on the preference optimization process? What criteria were used to define 'high-quality' reviews, and how were human preferences gathered and incorporated into the training process? The paper mentions using human preferences for review quality but does not provide details on the specific criteria used to define 'high-quality' or the process for gathering human preferences. Understanding these details is crucial for assessing the effectiveness of the preference optimization process. Fourth, how do you ensure the reproducibility of your experiments, particularly in terms of the training and evaluation of the AI agents? Will you be releasing the SimPEER dataset and the trained models? The paper lacks details on the computational resources used for training and deployment, which hinders the reproducibility of the research. Understanding the hardware and software requirements and the availability of the dataset and models is crucial for other researchers to replicate and build upon this work. Fifth, how do you handle multi-turn interactions in multi-agent simulations? Can you provide more details on the mechanisms used to manage the interactions between multiple reviewers and submissions? The paper mentions multi-agent simulations but does not provide details on how these interactions are managed. Understanding the mechanisms for managing multi-turn interactions is crucial for assessing the realism and effectiveness of the simulations. Finally, what are the limitations of using simulated peer reviews for training the ARA-PO agent? How do you address the potential gap between simulated and real-world peer review dynamics? The paper acknowledges the potential for bias in the simulated reviews but does not discuss the limitations of using simulated data for training. Understanding the limitations of simulated data and the methods for addressing the gap between simulated and real-world dynamics is crucial for assessing the generalizability of the findings.\n",

      "1. The concept of benchmarking papers is not clearly defined. The paper briefly mentions that these are \"other relevant papers\" but does not specify criteria for relevance or how these papers are selected. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the validity of the proposed approach. For example, it is unclear whether benchmarking papers are chosen based on citation counts, topic similarity, or some other metric. The absence of a concrete definition hinders the reproducibility of the experiments and limits the generalizability of the findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The paper claims that the multi-paper benchmarking approach incentivizes agents to provide more comprehensive and detailed reviews, but there is no empirical evidence to support this claim. The results presented in Figure 4 and Table 2 primarily focus on the originality and significance of the reviews, but the abstractness of the reviews is not evaluated. While the authors suggest that higher originality and significance imply more comprehensive reviews, this is not a direct measure. A more rigorous evaluation would require metrics that directly assess the depth and breadth of the review content, such as the number of unique points raised or the coverage of different aspects of the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The evaluation of the system is limited to the abstract level, which raises concerns about the practical applicability of the proposed method. While abstract-level evaluation can provide some insights, it does not fully capture the complexities of real-world peer review. The system's performance on full papers, which often contain intricate methodologies and detailed experimental setups, remains unknown. This limitation makes it difficult to assess the system's ability to handle the nuances and subtleties of comprehensive scientific papers.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the lack of clarity regarding benchmarking papers, the authors should provide a detailed definition of what constitutes a benchmarking paper within their framework. This definition should include specific criteria for selecting these papers, such as their relevance to the topic, their methodological similarity, or their contribution to the field. For instance, the authors could specify that benchmarking papers are selected based on a combination of topic similarity, measured by cosine similarity of word embeddings, and citation counts, ensuring that both relevant and influential papers are included. Furthermore, the authors should explain how the number of benchmarking papers is determined for each review and whether this number is fixed or varies depending on the paper's characteristics. This level of detail is crucial for ensuring the reproducibility of the experiments and for allowing other researchers to build upon their work. Without a clear definition, the core concept of the paper remains vague and difficult to evaluate.\n",
      "\n",
      "To strengthen the claim that multi-paper benchmarking leads to more comprehensive reviews, the authors should include empirical evidence that directly measures the comprehensiveness of the generated reviews. Instead of relying solely on originality and significance scores, which are indirect measures, the authors could use metrics such as the number of unique points raised in the review, the coverage of different aspects of the paper (e.g., methodology, experiments, theory), or the depth of the analysis. For example, the authors could use a combination of quantitative metrics, such as the number of sentences addressing different aspects of the paper, and qualitative metrics, such as human evaluations of the depth of the analysis. Additionally, the authors should conduct experiments that compare the comprehensiveness of reviews generated with and without benchmarking papers, using the same LLM and prompt settings, to isolate the effect of benchmarking. This would provide more direct evidence for the claim that multi-paper benchmarking leads to more comprehensive reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, to address the limitation of evaluating the system at the abstract level, the authors should conduct experiments using full papers. This would provide a more realistic assessment of the system's performance and its ability to handle the complexities of real-world peer review. The authors should also consider evaluating the system's ability to identify specific issues in the paper, such as methodological flaws, experimental errors, or theoretical inconsistencies. This could be done by comparing the system's reviews with human reviews and assessing the degree to which the system identifies the same issues. Furthermore, the authors should investigate how the system handles different types of papers, such as theoretical papers, experimental papers, and review papers, to ensure that the system is robust and generalizable. By conducting these additional experiments, the authors can provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their system and demonstrate its practical applicability.\n",

      "This paper introduces a new approach to scientific peer review using language models, called Multi-Paper Benchmarking Review (MPBR). The authors argue that traditional peer review is limited by human reviewers' time constraints, cognitive biases, and lack of expertise. MPBR aims to enhance the review process by incorporating multiple benchmarking papers, which allows for a more comprehensive and competitive evaluation of scientific work. The authors develop an agent system with reviewer and manager agents to automate the review process, reducing costs and minimizing human intervention. They construct a benchmark dataset from real-world reviews and demonstrate that MPBR produces higher-quality reviews, identifies methodological flaws, and fosters knowledge creation. The system is designed to be self-sustaining and is evaluated using both a benchmark dataset and a real-world study.\n",

A detailed analysis of the types of errors that the MPBR system can identify compared to human reviewers would also be valuable.

      "This paper proposes a multi-paper benchmarking review (MPBR) task, where each review is conditioned on multiple benchmarking papers. The authors find that multi-paper benchmarking incentivizes agents to provide more comprehensive and detailed reviews. Additionally, the authors propose a collective review setting to further aggregate the generated scores from multiple reviews, updating the language model's capabilities and evolving the agent's performance.\n",

      "1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n",
      "2. The proposed MPBR task is novel and interesting. The authors also propose a collective review setting to further aggregate the generated scores from multiple reviews, updating the language model's capabilities and evolving the agent's performance.\n",
      "3. The authors establish an agent system to facilitate the MPBR method. They develop two types of agents: reviewer agents and reviewer manager agents. The authors conduct experiments on the MPBR dataset and find that, with minimal human intervention, the manager agent can automatically select the three best reviews for each paper. These reviews are then aggregated into a single, comprehensive review that captures the most valuable feedback.\n",

      "1. The authors claim that the manager agent can automatically select the three best reviews for each paper. However, it is unclear how the manager agent selects the three best reviews. The authors should provide more details on the selection process, such as the criteria used to evaluate the quality of reviews and the algorithm used to rank and select the top three. For example, are the reviews evaluated based on their length, the number of issues identified, or the novelty of the feedback? What specific ranking algorithm is used, and how is it trained or tuned?\n",
      "2. The authors claim that the MPBR system provides more comprehensive and detailed reviews than traditional peer review. However, it is unclear how the authors measure the comprehensiveness and detail of reviews. The authors should provide more details on the evaluation metrics used to compare the MPBR system with traditional peer review. For instance, are the reviews compared based on the number of sentences, the number of unique concepts discussed, or the depth of analysis? It would be beneficial to see a breakdown of the evaluation metrics and how they correlate with the perceived quality of the reviews.\n",
      "3. The authors claim that MPBR reviews are more likely to identify and explain flaws in research methodology, which can help improve the integrity and reproducibility of scientific knowledge. However, it is unclear how the authors measure the ability of reviews to identify and explain flaws in research methodology. The authors should provide more details on the evaluation process used to assess the ability of reviews to identify and explain flaws in research methodology. For example, are the reviews evaluated by human experts, and what specific criteria are used to assess the quality of the identified flaws and the explanations provided?\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the lack of clarity regarding the manager agent's review selection process, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of the criteria used to evaluate review quality. This should include specific metrics such as the number of unique issues identified, the depth of analysis, the clarity of explanations, and the relevance of the feedback to the paper's core contributions. Furthermore, the authors should describe the algorithm used to rank and select the top three reviews. For example, is it a simple scoring system, or does it involve a more complex machine learning model? If a machine learning model is used, the authors should provide details on its training data, architecture, and performance. It would also be beneficial to include examples of reviews that were selected and those that were not, along with an explanation of why the selected reviews were considered superior. This would provide a more concrete understanding of the selection process and its effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "To clarify how the MPBR system provides more comprehensive and detailed reviews, the authors should provide a detailed breakdown of the evaluation metrics used to compare the MPBR system with traditional peer review. This should include metrics such as the average length of reviews, the number of unique concepts discussed, the depth of analysis, and the number of specific examples provided. The authors should also explain how these metrics correlate with the perceived quality of the reviews. For example, a longer review is not necessarily better if it is repetitive or lacks depth. It would be beneficial to see a comparison of the distribution of these metrics for both MPBR-generated reviews and traditional peer reviews. This would allow for a more quantitative assessment of the comprehensiveness and detail of the reviews. Furthermore, the authors should provide examples of reviews that highlight the differences in comprehensiveness and detail between the two approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the claim that MPBR reviews are more likely to identify and explain flaws in research methodology, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of the evaluation process used to assess this ability. This should include details on how the reviews are evaluated by human experts, the specific criteria used to assess the quality of the identified flaws, and the explanations provided. For example, are the experts looking for specific types of flaws, such as issues with experimental design, data analysis, or statistical methods? How are the explanations evaluated for clarity, completeness, and accuracy? It would be beneficial to include examples of reviews that successfully identified and explained flaws in research methodology, along with an explanation of why these reviews were considered superior. This would provide a more concrete understanding of the evaluation process and its effectiveness.\n",

      "1. Weakness Statement: The paper lacks a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology used to construct the benchmark dataset. Specifically, the process for selecting papers, extracting reviews, and annotating them for originality and significance is not well-defined. The absence of a clear methodology makes it difficult to assess the quality and representativeness of the dataset, which is crucial for the validity of the experimental results.

      "This paper introduces a novel approach to scientific peer review, termed Multi-Paper Benchmarking Review (MPBR), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the review process. The core idea behind MPBR is to evaluate a given paper in the context of other relevant, pre-existing research, referred to as 'benchmarking papers.' This approach aims to foster a more comprehensive and competitive review environment, encouraging the identification of original and significant contributions. The authors propose an agent-based system, comprising reviewer agents and a manager agent, to automate the review process. Reviewer agents generate individual reviews, while the manager agent selects and aggregates the most valuable feedback. The system is trained and evaluated using a newly constructed benchmark dataset derived from real-world reviews of AI conference submissions. The authors demonstrate that MPBR can produce higher-quality reviews, as measured by metrics such as originality, significance, and quality, compared to traditional peer review. They also show that the system can identify methodological flaws and foster knowledge creation. The paper presents a real-world study where the MPBR system was used to review papers submitted to AI conferences, providing further evidence of its practical applicability. The authors claim that their system is self-sustaining, requiring minimal human intervention, and can reduce the costs associated with traditional peer review. Overall, the paper presents a compelling vision for the future of scientific peer review, leveraging the power of LLMs to enhance the quality and efficiency of the process. However, as I will detail, there are several areas where the methodology and evaluation could be strengthened to further validate the proposed approach.\n",

      "I find several aspects of this paper to be particularly compelling. The most significant strength is the introduction of the Multi-Paper Benchmarking Review (MPBR) task itself. This is a novel and insightful approach to scientific peer review, moving beyond the traditional single-paper focus. By explicitly incorporating 'benchmarking papers' into the review process, the authors encourage a more comparative and competitive evaluation of research, which I believe can lead to more original and significant ideas. The agent-based system, with its reviewer and manager agents, is another notable contribution. This system automates the review process, reducing the burden on human reviewers and potentially minimizing biases. The use of a manager agent to select and aggregate the best reviews is a clever way to synthesize diverse perspectives and ensure the quality of the final output. Furthermore, the construction of a new benchmark dataset using real-world reviews from top AI conferences is a valuable contribution to the field. This dataset, which includes annotations for originality and significance, provides a much-needed resource for developing and evaluating LLM-based review systems. The authors' efforts to validate their approach through a real-world study, where the MPBR system was used to review papers submitted to AI conferences, is also commendable. This demonstrates the practical applicability of their system and provides further evidence of its effectiveness. Finally, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, making the core concepts and contributions accessible to a broad audience. The authors clearly articulate their motivation, methodology, and findings, which I appreciate. The combination of these strengths makes this paper a significant contribution to the field of AI-assisted scientific peer review.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a clear and detailed explanation of the methodology used to construct the benchmark dataset. While the authors mention that the dataset is derived from real-world reviews of top AI conferences, they do not provide specific details on how the papers and reviews were selected. For instance, the paper states that they collected 16,130 reviews for 5,445 papers, but it is unclear how these specific papers and reviews were chosen from the vast collection of AI conference submissions. The paper also mentions that the reviews were labeled for originality and significance using a combination of rule-based matching and state-of-the-art models, but it does not provide details on the specific rule-based methods or models used, nor how they were combined. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the quality and representativeness of the dataset, which is crucial for the validity of the experimental results. The absence of a clear methodology also hinders the reproducibility of the experiments and limits the generalizability of the findings. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's 'Benchmark Dataset' section lacks the necessary details. Second, the paper does not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method. While the authors present results from a real-world study, the results are limited and do not fully demonstrate the effectiveness of the MPBR system. The paper lacks quantitative metrics, such as inter-annotator agreement for the dataset annotations, which is a standard practice for evaluating annotation quality. Furthermore, the paper does not provide a detailed comparison with traditional peer review processes. While the real-world study compares MPBR with traditional reviews, the analysis is not extensive, and there is no thorough analysis of the types of errors that the MPBR system can identify compared to human reviewers. The potential for the system to introduce new biases is also not adequately addressed. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the evaluation sections primarily focus on comparisons within the MPBR framework and lack a detailed quantitative comparison with traditional peer review, inter-annotator agreement, and a thorough analysis of error identification and biases. Third, the paper's structure and organization could be improved. The lack of a dedicated 'Method' section makes it difficult to understand the technical details of the proposed approach. While the paper contains information about the method across several sections, it lacks a single, consolidated section that clearly outlines the methodology. The absence of a clear workflow diagram further complicates the understanding of the overall process. The paper would benefit from a more structured presentation of the methodology, including a detailed description of the agent system and its components, and a clear explanation of how the benchmark dataset was constructed and used. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the methodological details are scattered across multiple sections rather than being consolidated in a dedicated 'Method' section, and a workflow diagram is missing. Fourth, the paper's definition of 'benchmarking papers' is initially vague. While the paper later clarifies that these papers are selected using semantic similarity and keyword matching against arXiv, the initial definition is unclear, and the specific algorithms and thresholds used are not detailed. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to assess the validity of the proposed approach. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the initial definition is vague, but the 'Reviewer Manager Agents' section provides more detail on the selection process using semantic similarity and keyword matching. Fifth, the paper claims that the multi-paper benchmarking approach incentivizes agents to provide more comprehensive and detailed reviews, but there is no direct empirical evidence to support this claim. The results presented primarily focus on originality and significance, but the abstractness of the reviews is not evaluated. While the authors suggest that higher originality and significance imply more comprehensive reviews, this is not a direct measure. A more rigorous evaluation would require metrics that directly assess the depth and breadth of the review content, such as the number of unique points raised or the coverage of different aspects of the paper. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper claims increased comprehensiveness and detail but relies on metrics that don't directly measure these qualities. The correlation between the metrics and perceived quality is not discussed. Finally, the paper lacks clarity on how the manager agent selects the three best reviews. While the paper mentions using human feedback for validation, it does not specify the exact criteria or algorithm used to rank and select the top three reviews based on this feedback. The type of human feedback (e.g., specific scores for different aspects of the review) and how it's translated into a selection algorithm are not detailed. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper mentions human feedback for validation but lacks specifics on the criteria and algorithm used by the manager agent to select the top three reviews.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, to clarify the benchmark dataset construction, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of the process used to select papers and extract reviews. This should include specific criteria for paper selection, such as the time period, the conferences considered, and the method used to identify relevant reviews. The authors should also describe the annotation process for originality and significance, including the number of annotators, their expertise, and the inter-annotator agreement. Furthermore, the authors should clarify how they handled cases where multiple reviews were available for a single paper, and how they ensured the quality and consistency of the annotations. Including examples of the annotation process and the types of reviews included in the dataset would also be beneficial. This level of detail is crucial for the reproducibility and validity of the research. Second, to improve the evaluation of the proposed method, the authors should provide a more comprehensive analysis of the real-world study. This should include quantitative metrics, such as the number of papers reviewed, the acceptance rate, and the feedback from conference chairs and reviewers. The authors should also compare the performance of the MPBR system with traditional peer review processes, using metrics such as the time taken for review, the quality of the feedback, and the identification of methodological flaws. A detailed analysis of the types of errors that the MPBR system can identify compared to human reviewers would also be valuable. This analysis should include examples of specific errors identified by the MPBR system and a discussion of the potential for the system to introduce new biases. The authors should also consider conducting a user study to assess the usability and effectiveness of the MPBR system. Third, to improve the paper's structure and organization, the authors should include a dedicated 'Method' section that provides a detailed description of the proposed approach. This section should include a clear explanation of the agent system and its components, as well as a detailed description of how the benchmark dataset was constructed and used. A workflow diagram would also be beneficial to illustrate the overall process. The authors should also consider reorganizing the paper to improve the flow of information and make it easier for readers to understand the proposed approach. This could include moving some of the experimental details to an appendix and focusing on the key findings in the main body of the paper. Fourth, to address the lack of clarity regarding benchmarking papers, the authors should provide a detailed definition of what constitutes a benchmarking paper within their framework. This definition should include specific criteria for selecting these papers, such as their relevance to the topic, their methodological similarity, or their contribution to the field. For instance, the authors could specify that benchmarking papers are selected based on a combination of topic similarity, measured by cosine similarity of word embeddings, and citation counts, ensuring that both relevant and influential papers are included. Furthermore, the authors should explain how the number of benchmarking papers is determined for each review and whether this number is fixed or varies depending on the paper's characteristics. This level of detail is crucial for ensuring the reproducibility of the experiments and for allowing other researchers to build upon their work. Fifth, to strengthen the claim that multi-paper benchmarking leads to more comprehensive reviews, the authors should include empirical evidence that directly measures the comprehensiveness of the generated reviews. Instead of relying solely on originality and significance scores, which are indirect measures, the authors could use metrics such as the number of unique points raised in the review, the coverage of different aspects of the paper (e.g., methodology, experiments, theory), or the depth of the analysis. For example, the authors could use a combination of quantitative metrics, such as the number of sentences addressing different aspects of the paper, and qualitative metrics, such as human evaluations of the depth of the analysis. Additionally, the authors should conduct experiments that compare the comprehensiveness of reviews generated with and without benchmarking papers, using the same LLM and prompt settings, to isolate the effect of benchmarking. Finally, to address the lack of clarity regarding the manager agent's review selection process, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of the criteria used to evaluate review quality. This should include specific metrics such as the number of unique issues identified, the depth of analysis, the clarity of explanations, and the relevance of the feedback to the paper's core contributions. Furthermore, the authors should describe the algorithm used to rank and select the top three reviews. For example, is it a simple scoring system, or does it involve a more complex machine learning model? If a machine learning model is used, the authors should provide details on its training data, architecture, and performance. It would also be beneficial to include examples of reviews that were selected and those that were not, along with an explanation of why the selected reviews were considered superior. These suggestions, if implemented, would significantly strengthen the paper and further validate the proposed approach.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the paper's methodology and findings. First, could the authors provide more details on the methodology used to construct the benchmark dataset? Specifically, how were the papers and reviews selected, and what criteria were used for annotation? I am particularly interested in the specific rule-based methods and state-of-the-art models used for labeling originality and significance, and how these were combined. Second, can the authors elaborate on the evaluation metrics used to assess the performance of the MPBR system? How do these metrics demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to traditional peer review? I am especially interested in how the metrics correlate with the perceived quality of the reviews and how the system's ability to identify methodological flaws is measured. Third, how does the MPBR system handle cases where there is a disagreement among reviewer agents? Is there a mechanism for resolving such disagreements, and if so, how does it work? I am curious about the specific criteria and algorithm used by the manager agent to select the top three reviews, and how human feedback is incorporated into this process. Fourth, what are the potential limitations or biases of the MPBR system, and how do the authors plan to address them in future work? I am particularly interested in the potential for the system to introduce new biases and how the authors plan to mitigate these risks. Fifth, how do the authors define and select benchmarking papers? What criteria are used to determine their relevance, and how is the number of benchmarking papers determined for each review? I am interested in the specific algorithms and thresholds used for semantic similarity and keyword matching, and how the quality of benchmarking papers is ensured. Finally, can the authors provide empirical evidence that demonstrates the multi-paper benchmarking approach leads to more comprehensive and detailed reviews compared to traditional peer review or single-paper reviews? I am interested in the specific metrics used to measure the depth and breadth of the review content, and how these metrics correlate with the perceived quality of the reviews. These questions are aimed at clarifying key uncertainties and assumptions in the paper, and I believe that addressing them would significantly enhance the paper's overall contribution.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper needs significant improvements in clarity and experimental validation. The authors should begin by thoroughly explaining all technical terms and jargon used in the paper. This includes providing clear definitions and context for terms like 'multi-agent system,' 'reward modeling mechanism,' and any other specialized vocabulary. The paper should be written in a way that is accessible to a broader audience, not just those already deeply familiar with the specific techniques used. Additionally, the authors should avoid unnecessary complex language and strive for a more straightforward and concise writing style. The use of concrete examples to illustrate key concepts would also greatly improve the paper's readability. For instance, when describing the interaction between the LLM agents, a step-by-step example of a review simulation would be beneficial.\n",
      "\n",
      "To strengthen the claims about the framework's effectiveness, the authors need to conduct more rigorous experiments. The current experiments do not provide sufficient evidence to support the strong claims made about the quality of reviews, author preference, and alignment with actual reviews. The authors should consider using a larger and more diverse dataset for testing the framework. They should also include a more detailed analysis of the results, including statistical significance tests and comparisons with other existing methods. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of how the framework's performance is measured. For example, how is 'review quality' defined and quantified? How is 'alignment with actual reviews' assessed? Providing these details will allow for a more objective evaluation of the framework's performance. The authors should also consider including a human evaluation of the generated reviews to provide a more qualitative assessment of the framework's effectiveness.\n",

This could include a discussion of how the framework captures the iterative nature of reviews, the different perspectives of reviewers, and the influence of author feedback. The authors should also address the limitations of their framework and discuss potential areas for future improvement. For example, how does the framework handle situations where reviewers disagree?

      "1. The paper lacks a thorough comparison with existing multi-agent LLM frameworks. While the authors mention some related work, they do not provide a detailed analysis of how ReviewGame differs from and improves upon these frameworks. Specifically, the paper does not address how ReviewGame's competitive multi-agent approach compares to collaborative multi-agent systems for scientific review, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of its novelty and advantages. A more rigorous comparison should include a discussion of the specific algorithms, communication protocols, and reward mechanisms used in other multi-agent systems and how they differ from the proposed framework.\n",
      "2. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for implementing ReviewGame.

      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper should include a more detailed comparison with existing multi-agent LLM frameworks, focusing on the specific differences in algorithms, communication protocols, and reward mechanisms. For instance, the authors could compare ReviewGame's competitive approach with collaborative multi-agent systems, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in the context of scientific review. This comparison should not only focus on the high-level architecture but also delve into the technical details of how agents interact, how they are trained, and how their performance is evaluated. A table summarizing the key differences between ReviewGame and other relevant frameworks would be beneficial. Furthermore, the authors should discuss the potential for incorporating elements of collaborative approaches into ReviewGame to enhance its performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the lack of computational resource analysis, the paper should provide a detailed breakdown of the computational costs associated with each stage of the ReviewGame process. This should include the number of LLM calls, the type of hardware used (e.g., GPU model), and the time taken for each stage. The authors should also discuss the memory requirements and the potential for parallelization to reduce computational time. It would be beneficial to include a discussion of the trade-offs between computational cost and review quality, exploring whether there are ways to reduce the computational burden without sacrificing the quality of the generated reviews. The authors should also consider the scalability of the framework, discussing how the computational costs would increase with a larger number of submissions or reviewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the paper should include a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the ReviewGame framework and potential areas for future research. This should include a discussion of how the framework handles situations where reviewers disagree significantly, how it accounts for potential biases in the LLMs used, and how it could be extended to handle different types of scientific reviews. The authors should also explore the potential for incorporating human feedback into the training process to improve the quality and reliability of the generated reviews. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the ethical implications of using LLMs for scientific review, such as the potential for bias and the need for transparency and accountability.\n",

      "## Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper introduces ReviewGame, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate the scientific review process as a competitive multi-agent game. The core idea is to model the review process as a competition among multiple LLM agents, each acting as a reviewer, with the goal of producing the best review. This approach contrasts with previous single-agent models and aims to better reflect the dynamics of real-world peer review. The framework incorporates author feedback and is explicitly connected to the scientific method, emphasizing the importance of refutation and critical scrutiny. The authors evaluate ReviewGame on the ICLR 2024 submissions, comparing it against GPT-4o and the chain-of-thought (CoT) method. Their empirical findings suggest that ReviewGame outperforms these baselines in terms of review quality, author preference, and alignment with actual review outcomes. The authors claim that their framework has the potential to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific peer review, ultimately accelerating the pace of scientific discovery. The paper's main contribution lies in its innovative approach to modeling peer review as a competitive multi-agent game, and the empirical results provide some support for its effectiveness. However, the paper also has several limitations, particularly in its lack of detailed comparisons with other multi-agent LLM frameworks, its limited analysis of computational resources, and its somewhat overreaching claims about the impact of the framework. Despite these limitations, the paper presents a promising approach to automating and improving the scientific review process.\n",

      "\n",
      "I find the core idea of modeling the scientific review process as a competitive multi-agent game to be a significant strength of this paper. This approach, which the authors term ReviewGame, is a novel way to simulate the dynamics of peer review, moving beyond the limitations of single-agent models. By having multiple LLM agents compete to produce the best review, the framework aims to capture the iterative and critical nature of the review process more accurately. The connection the authors draw between their framework and the scientific method is also a notable strength. By emphasizing refutation and critical scrutiny, they ground their approach in a well-established paradigm, adding theoretical depth to their work. This connection highlights the potential of ReviewGame to enhance the quality of scientific review by encouraging a more rigorous evaluation of research. Furthermore, the empirical evaluations conducted on the ICLR 2024 submissions provide valuable evidence for the effectiveness of ReviewGame. The authors demonstrate that their framework outperforms GPT-4o and the chain-of-thought method in terms of review quality, author preference, and alignment with actual review outcomes. These results, based on a substantial dataset of 749 papers, suggest that ReviewGame has the potential to generate high-quality reviews that are both preferred by authors and aligned with the actual review process. The inclusion of a pilot study on NeurIPS submissions further strengthens the empirical basis of the paper. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its innovative approach, its theoretical grounding in the scientific method, and its empirical validation on a real-world dataset.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "After a thorough examination of the paper, I've identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a detailed comparison with existing multi-agent LLM frameworks. While the authors mention related work, they do not provide a rigorous analysis of how ReviewGame differs from and improves upon these frameworks. Specifically, the paper does not address how ReviewGame's competitive multi-agent approach compares to collaborative multi-agent systems for scientific review. This omission is significant because a more comprehensive understanding of its novelty and advantages can only be achieved through a detailed comparison with other multi-agent systems. The paper mentions related work in the \"Related Work\" section, including \\citet{jin2024agentreviewexploringpeerreview} and \\citet{liang2024can} which employ LLMs as agents in a multi-reviewer setting. However, the paper does not delve into the specific algorithms, communication protocols, or reward mechanisms of other multi-agent LLM frameworks for scientific review. This lack of comparison makes it difficult to assess the true novelty and contribution of ReviewGame. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's content clearly lacks the necessary comparative analysis. Second, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for implementing ReviewGame. This is a critical omission, as the practicality and scalability of the framework depend heavily on its computational demands. The paper should include a breakdown of the computational costs associated with each stage of the ReviewGame process, such as the initial review generation, critique stage, and author feedback stage. This should include the number of LLM calls, the type of hardware used (e.g., GPU model), and the time taken for each stage. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the memory requirements and the potential for parallelization to reduce computational time. The absence of this information makes it difficult to assess the feasibility of implementing ReviewGame in real-world scenarios. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper provides no information on computational resources. Third, the paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the ReviewGame framework and potential areas for future research. While the paper includes a \"Limitations and Broader Impacts\" section, it is very brief and does not address several important issues. For example, the paper does not address how the framework handles situations where reviewers disagree significantly or how it accounts for potential biases in the LLMs used. The paper should also discuss the limitations of using LLMs for review generation, such as the potential for generating reviews that are superficial or lack the depth of human expert reviews. Additionally, the paper should explore how the framework could be extended to handle different types of scientific reviews, such as those for grant proposals or conference submissions. The lack of a thorough discussion of these limitations and future directions weakens the paper's overall impact. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's discussion of limitations is clearly insufficient. Finally, the paper's writing style and use of technical jargon make it difficult to read. The authors use many technical terms without explaining them, making it hard to follow. Additionally, the paper is full of jargon and complex language that is not necessary. This lack of clarity hinders the accessibility of the paper and makes it difficult for a broader audience to understand the core concepts and contributions. My confidence in this weakness is medium, as while the paper does present the information, the presentation could be significantly improved for clarity.\n",

      "\n",
      "Based on the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements for this paper. First, the authors should include a more detailed comparison with existing multi-agent LLM frameworks. This comparison should not only focus on the high-level architecture but also delve into the technical details of how agents interact, how they are trained, and how their performance is evaluated. Specifically, the authors should compare ReviewGame's competitive approach with collaborative multi-agent systems, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each approach in the context of scientific review. A table summarizing the key differences between ReviewGame and other relevant frameworks would be beneficial. Furthermore, the authors should discuss the potential for incorporating elements of collaborative approaches into ReviewGame to enhance its performance. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the novelty and advantages of ReviewGame. Second, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for implementing ReviewGame. This analysis should include a breakdown of the computational costs associated with each stage of the ReviewGame process, such as the initial review generation, critique stage, and author feedback stage. This should include the number of LLM calls, the type of hardware used (e.g., GPU model), and the time taken for each stage. The authors should also discuss the memory requirements and the potential for parallelization to reduce computational time. It would be beneficial to include a discussion of the trade-offs between computational cost and review quality, exploring whether there are ways to reduce the computational burden without sacrificing the quality of the generated reviews. The authors should also consider the scalability of the framework, discussing how the computational costs would increase with a larger number of submissions or reviewers. Third, the authors should include a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the ReviewGame framework and potential areas for future research. This should include a discussion of how the framework handles situations where reviewers disagree significantly, how it accounts for potential biases in the LLMs used, and how it could be extended to handle different types of scientific reviews. The authors should also explore the potential for incorporating human feedback into the training process to improve the quality and reliability of the generated reviews. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the ethical implications of using LLMs for scientific review, such as the potential for bias and the need for transparency and accountability. Finally, the authors should significantly improve the clarity and accessibility of their writing. This includes providing clear definitions and context for technical terms and avoiding unnecessary complex language. The use of concrete examples to illustrate key concepts would also greatly improve the paper's readability. For instance, when describing the interaction between the LLM agents, a step-by-step example of a review simulation would be beneficial. These changes would make the paper more accessible to a broader audience and enhance its overall impact.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for further understanding and improving the ReviewGame framework. First, how does ReviewGame handle situations where reviewers disagree significantly? The paper does not provide a detailed explanation of how the framework manages conflicting opinions among reviewers, which is a common occurrence in real-world peer review. Understanding how ReviewGame resolves or mitigates such disagreements is essential for assessing its robustness and reliability. Second, can the authors provide more details on the computational resources required for implementing ReviewGame? This includes the number of LLM calls, the type of hardware used, the time taken for each stage, and the memory requirements. This information is crucial for assessing the practicality and scalability of the framework. Third, how does ReviewGame account for potential biases in the LLMs used? The paper acknowledges that the reward model is trained on a dataset of paper-author-interaction trajectories, which may introduce biases. However, it does not provide a detailed explanation of how these biases are identified and mitigated. Understanding how the framework addresses potential biases is essential for ensuring the fairness and objectivity of the review process. Fourth, can ReviewGame be extended to handle different types of scientific reviews, such as those for grant proposals or conference submissions? The paper focuses primarily on peer review for academic papers, but the framework's adaptability to other review scenarios is an important area for future research. Finally, could the authors provide more details about the experiments they conducted to support their claims about the framework's effectiveness? Specifically, how did they measure the quality of reviews, author preference, and alignment with actual reviews? Additionally, how did they compare ReviewGame to other methods, and what evidence do they have to support the claim that ReviewGame is more representative of the actual review process? These questions target key uncertainties and methodological choices that need further clarification.\n",

The experiments are limited to a specific set of machine learning papers, and it is unclear if the performance would hold across diverse fields with varying methodologies and standards. For instance, fields like biomedicine or physics might present unique challenges due to their specific experimental designs and evaluation metrics.\n",
      "2. The evaluation of AIReviewer’s review quality and AIResearch’s idea novelty lacks some standard quantitative metrics. While the paper mentions comparisons to human reviews, it does not specify the metrics used for these comparisons, making it difficult to assess the robustness of the evaluation.

      "To address the limitations in generalizability, the authors should conduct experiments across a wider range of scientific domains, including fields such as biomedicine, physics, and social sciences. This would involve curating datasets of papers from these domains and evaluating the performance of AIReviewer and AIResearch. The evaluation should also consider the specific challenges of each domain, such as different experimental designs, evaluation metrics, and terminology. For example, in biomedicine, the focus might be on the validity of clinical trials and the interpretation of statistical results, while in physics, the emphasis might be on the theoretical soundness and experimental reproducibility. Furthermore, the authors should explore how the models handle interdisciplinary research, which often combines methodologies and concepts from multiple fields. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the proposed systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve the evaluation of AIReviewer and AIResearch, the authors should incorporate standard quantitative metrics for review quality and idea novelty. For review quality, metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score could be used to assess the accuracy of the reviews in identifying strengths, weaknesses, and potential errors in the papers. The authors should also consider using metrics that measure the clarity, coherence, and constructiveness of the reviews. For idea novelty, metrics such as the number of novel concepts generated, the diversity of the generated ideas, and the impact of the ideas on the scientific community could be used. The authors should also explore the use of human evaluation to validate the quantitative metrics and provide a more comprehensive assessment of the quality and novelty of the reviews and ideas.

      "Finally, the authors should address the potential biases in the training data for the AI4Science Reward Model. This could involve using techniques such as data augmentation, debiasing algorithms, and adversarial training to reduce the impact of biases in the training data. The authors should also explore the use of different reward models that are trained on diverse datasets and that incorporate different evaluation criteria. Furthermore, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of the potential biases in the generated reviews and ideas, and they should develop methods to mitigate these biases. This would involve examining the reviews and ideas for evidence of bias and developing strategies to ensure that the AI systems are fair, objective, and unbiased.

      "## Summary:\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper introduces two innovative AI-powered agents, AIReviewer and AIResearch, designed to automate scientific peer review and idea generation, respectively. AIReviewer is an interactive system that conducts multi-round reviews of scientific papers, engaging in a dialogue with authors to provide detailed feedback. It leverages a large language model (LLM) to assess paper quality and suggest improvements, aiming to streamline the peer review process. AIResearch, on the other hand, employs a collaborative approach where two AI agents engage in debate-style conversations to generate novel scientific ideas. These ideas are then refined and ranked using a specialized AI4Science Reward Model, trained on preference data from AIReview. The core methodological approach involves training these agents using LLMs and evaluating their performance through comparisons with human reviewers and expert ratings. The empirical findings suggest that AIReviewer can produce reviews comparable in quality to intermediate human reviewers, and AIResearch can efficiently generate novel and high-quality scientific ideas, outperforming the PACCAR model in terms of generation speed and idea quality. The paper also introduces a benchmark dataset of AIReview reviews on ISMRL papers, which can be used for future development of scientific peer review and idea generation models. Overall, the paper presents a significant step towards automating key aspects of the scientific process, with potential implications for research efficiency and collaboration. However, the study also reveals several limitations that need to be addressed to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the proposed systems.\n",

      "\n",
      "I find the introduction of AIReviewer and AIResearch to be a significant strength of this paper. The authors have creatively combined multi-agent debate and preference learning techniques to tackle the complex tasks of scientific peer review and idea generation. The concept of using AI to assist in these crucial aspects of scientific workflow is innovative and could have a substantial impact on the research community. The interactive nature of AIReviewer, which allows for multi-round discussions with authors, is a novel approach that mimics the real-world peer review process. Similarly, the debate-style conversation between two AI agents in AIResearch for idea generation is a unique method that encourages the exploration of diverse perspectives. The use of an AI4Science Reward Model, trained on preference data from AIReview, to rank scientific ideas is another creative solution that aligns the idea generation process with scientific standards. Furthermore, the paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of AIReview and AIResearch, including a large-scale human study comparing AIReview’s performance to intermediate human reviewers and benchmarks against existing models like PACCAR. The results, while not without limitations, demonstrate the potential of these AI agents to produce high-quality reviews and generate novel scientific ideas. Finally, the introduction of a benchmark dataset of AIReview reviews on ISMRL papers is a valuable contribution to the field, providing a resource for future research and development in automated scientific peer review and idea generation. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with detailed descriptions of the AIReviewer and AIResearch frameworks, the AI4Science Reward Model, and experimental setups, which makes it easy to follow the methodology and understand the findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "After a thorough examination of the paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. Firstly, the paper does not provide sufficient evidence on how well AIReviewer and AIResearch generalize to different scientific domains or complex, interdisciplinary topics. The experiments are limited to a specific set of 26 machine learning papers from the ISMRL dataset, as explicitly stated in Section 3.1, and it remains unclear if the performance would hold across diverse fields with varying methodologies and standards. For instance, fields like biomedicine or physics might present unique challenges due to their specific experimental designs and evaluation metrics. This lack of generalizability is a significant limitation, as the paper does not explore the potential challenges or adaptations needed for applying these agents to other scientific domains. Secondly, the evaluation of AIReviewer’s review quality and AIResearch’s idea novelty lacks some standard quantitative metrics. While the paper mentions comparisons to human reviews, it does not specify the metrics used for these comparisons, making it difficult to assess the robustness of the evaluation. For AIReview, the paper uses the percentage of human evaluators who prefer reviews from AIReview, Human Reviewers, or are Indifferent (Figure 2 caption) and agreement rate on the best idea, and an average agreement rate across all ideas (Section 3.5). However, it lacks standard quantitative metrics like precision, recall, or F1-score for review quality. Similarly, for AIResearch, the paper uses Importance, Feasibility, and Novelty (rated on a scale of 1-9), and Generation Time (measured in seconds) (Table 1 caption), but it does not include diversity metrics for idea novelty. The absence of these standard metrics makes it hard to validate the claims and objectively assess the performance of the proposed agents. Furthermore, the paper does not fully address the potential biases that might be present in the training data for the AI4Science Reward Model. The reward model is trained on preference data from AIReview, which may inherit biases from the LLM used to generate the reviews, as stated in Section 2.3. This could lead to a reinforcement of existing biases in the scientific literature, rather than a neutral evaluation. The paper does not include any analysis or discussion about potential biases in the AIReview-generated preference data used to train the AI4Science Reward Model. Additionally, the experiments are conducted on a relatively small dataset of 26 papers, which may not be representative of the broader range of scientific research. This limited dataset size raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings and the robustness of the models. The paper explicitly states that the experiments are conducted on machine learning papers from the ISMRL dataset (Section 3.1), and there is no discussion about the limitations of using a small dataset or the potential impact on generalizability. Finally, the paper does not discuss the computational resources required for training and deploying AIReviewer and AIResearch, which could be a barrier to adoption for some researchers. While the paper mentions using DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 1 and F8 Quantization for training the AI4Science Reward Model (Section 3.3), it lacks details on hardware, training time, and inference costs for either AIReview or AIResearch. The lack of information on the hardware requirements, training time, and inference latency of the models makes it difficult to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed systems. These weaknesses, all of which I have directly verified from the paper, significantly impact the conclusions and generalizability of the research. My confidence in these identified issues is high, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and lack of discussion on these critical aspects.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the limitations in generalizability, I recommend that the authors conduct experiments across a wider range of scientific domains, including fields such as biomedicine, physics, and social sciences. This would involve curating datasets of papers from these domains and evaluating the performance of AIReviewer and AIResearch. The evaluation should also consider the specific challenges of each domain, such as different experimental designs, evaluation metrics, and terminology. For example, in biomedicine, the focus might be on the validity of clinical trials and the interpretation of statistical results, while in physics, the emphasis might be on the theoretical soundness and experimental reproducibility. Furthermore, the authors should explore how the models handle interdisciplinary research, which often combines methodologies and concepts from multiple fields. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the proposed systems. To improve the evaluation of AIReviewer and AIResearch, the authors should incorporate standard quantitative metrics for review quality and idea novelty. For review quality, metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score could be used to assess the accuracy of the reviews in identifying strengths, weaknesses, and potential errors in the papers. The authors should also consider using metrics that measure the clarity, coherence, and constructiveness of the reviews. For idea novelty, metrics such as the number of novel concepts generated, the diversity of the generated ideas, and the impact of the ideas on the scientific community could be used. The authors should also explore the use of human evaluation to validate the quantitative metrics and provide a more comprehensive assessment of the quality and novelty of the reviews and ideas. This would involve having expert reviewers assess the reviews and ideas generated by the AI systems and compare them to human-generated reviews and ideas. To address the potential biases in the training data for the AI4Science Reward Model, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of the training data used for AIReviewer, identifying any potential biases that may be present. They should also evaluate the performance of AIReviewer on edge cases, such as interdisciplinary research or papers that challenge established paradigms. This evaluation should include a qualitative analysis of the reviews generated by AIReviewer, focusing on the fairness and objectivity of the feedback. The authors should also explore techniques to mitigate bias in the training data, such as data augmentation or adversarial training. Furthermore, the authors should consider incorporating human oversight into the review process, allowing human reviewers to validate and refine the feedback provided by AIReviewer. This would help to ensure the fairness and accuracy of the reviews, while also providing a valuable learning opportunity for human reviewers. Finally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the iterative process between AIReviewer and human authors. This should include a description of the specific types of feedback provided by AIReviewer, as well as the mechanisms for human authors to refine and improve the generated reviews. The authors should also conduct a user study to evaluate the effectiveness of the iterative process, focusing on the quality of the reviews generated by the system and the satisfaction of the human authors. This user study should include both expert and novice reviewers to assess the usability of the system across different levels of expertise. The authors should also explore the use of different prompting strategies to improve the quality of the generated reviews and to encourage critical thinking and creativity in the review process. In addition, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required for training and deploying AIReviewer and AIResearch, including the hardware requirements, training time, and inference costs. This would help researchers assess the practical feasibility of the proposed systems and make informed decisions about their adoption. The authors should also explore techniques to reduce the computational cost of the models, such as model compression or quantization, to make them more accessible to researchers with limited resources.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for further understanding and development of this research. Firstly, how well do AIReviewer and AIResearch generalize to different scientific domains or complex, interdisciplinary topics? The experiments are limited to a specific set of machine learning papers, and it is unclear if the performance would hold across diverse fields with varying methodologies and standards. Secondly, what specific quantitative metrics were used to evaluate the quality of AIReview’s reviews and the novelty of AIResearch’s generated ideas? The paper could benefit from a clearer explanation of the evaluation criteria and how they compare to human-generated reviews and ideas. Thirdly, how does the AI4Science Reward Model account for potential biases in the training data, and what measures are in place to ensure fairness and objectivity in the reviews and ideas generated? Fourthly, given the relatively small dataset of 26 papers used in the experiments, how confident are the authors in the generalizability of their findings? Would the models’ performance improve with a larger, more diverse dataset? Fifthly, what are the computational requirements for training and deploying AIReviewer and AIResearch? This information would be valuable for researchers considering adopting these tools, especially those with limited computational resources. Sixthly, how does the system ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the peer review process when using AIReviewer, given the sensitivity of scientific reviews? Seventhly, what measures are in place to prevent the perpetuation of existing biases in scientific literature through the AI-generated reviews and ideas? Eighthly, how does the debate-style conversation in AIResearch contribute to the novelty and quality of generated scientific ideas compared to single-agent idea generation? Ninthly, can the AI4Science Reward Model be adapted to evaluate ideas in scientific domains beyond machine learning, and how would its performance vary across different fields? Finally, how does the system handle disagreements or conflicts that may arise during the multi-round review process with AIReviewer? These questions target the core methodological choices, assumptions, and limitations of the study, and I believe addressing them would significantly enhance the robustness and applicability of the proposed AI agents.\n",

It is unclear how these agents are implemented, what algorithms are used for their training, and how they interact within the proposed framework. The paper needs to provide a more detailed explanation of the mechanisms that drive the agents' behavior and their interplay.\n",
      "2. The paper does not provide sufficient details on the fine-tuning process of the specialized model. Specifically, the architecture of the model, the size of the dataset used for fine-tuning, and the hyperparameter settings are not clearly stated.

The authors should also clarify how the critic and reviewer agents interact within this game, and how their interactions lead to improved review quality. A concrete example of a review scenario, illustrating the agents' interactions and the resulting improvements, would be beneficial.

This level of detail is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the PAIR framework and for enabling other researchers to reproduce the results.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. Evidence Collection:\n",
      "a) Method-related Evidence:\n",
      "   - The paper introduces the \"two-player zero-sum game\" concept in the \"Problem Formulation\" section: \"This dynamic interaction not only boosts the review quality but also provides valuable guidance for authors to refine their work.\" and \"The reviewer agent can be trained using two approaches: preference tuning and reinforcement learning\\footnote{This is based on a misunderstanding of the original paper, where \"preference tuning\" is not explicitly defined as fine-tuning on human reviews. The method involves transforming reviews into comparison pairs, which is not the same as directly fine-tuning on the reviews themselves.} on human reviews and reinforcement learning on feedback from the critic agent.\"\n",
      "   - The \"Critic Agent\" section describes the three feedback modes but doesn't explicitly link them to the zero-sum game concept.\n",
      "   - The \"Reviewer Agent\" section mentions preference tuning and reinforcement learning but lacks specific algorithmic details.\n",
      "   - The \"Algorithm\" section provides a high-level overview of the iterative process but doesn't detail the underlying mechanisms of the agents.\n",

      "   - The \"Experiments\" section describes the setup and results but doesn't provide implementation details of the agents.\n",

      "3. Literature Gap Analysis:\n",
      "   - While the paper mentions \"preference optimization\" and cites relevant papers, it doesn't explicitly connect the \"two-player zero-sum game\" to established game theory concepts or algorithms used in such settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Validation Analysis:\n",
      "   - The reviewer correctly points out the lack of a clear and detailed explanation of the \"two-player zero-sum game\" concept within the PAIR framework. While the paper mentions the interaction between the critic and reviewer agents, it doesn't formally define the game, its payoff functions, or the equilibrium conditions. The description of the agents' roles, training methodologies, and interaction protocols is indeed high-level. The paper mentions reinforcement learning but doesn't specify the exact algorithms used for training either the critic or the reviewer agent. The interaction protocol is described in the \"Algorithm\" section, but the underlying mechanisms driving the agents' behavior are not elaborated upon.\n",

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces a novel framework, termed PAIR (Peer Review as Iterative Refinement), designed to enhance the quality of scientific peer reviews using large language models (LLMs). The core idea of PAIR is to simulate the iterative nature of peer review through a two-agent system: a critic LLM and a reviewer LLM. The critic provides feedback on the reviewer's initial review, which the reviewer then uses to refine and improve their assessment. This process is framed as a two-player zero-sum game, although the specifics of this game-theoretic formulation are not fully elaborated. The authors explore different feedback modes for the critic, including ranking, rejection, and construction, and evaluate the impact of these modes on the quality of the generated reviews. They also investigate the use of reinforcement learning and preference tuning to further enhance the performance of both the critic and reviewer agents. The experimental evaluation primarily focuses on papers from the AI Index 2023 Annual Report, with a specialized model fine-tuned on high-quality reviews from the Computer Physics Communications (CPC) journal. The results indicate that the PAIR framework can generate feedback that is comparable to human reviewers, with the GPT-4L model achieving a significant improvement in usefulness score after iterative refinement. The paper's main contribution lies in its innovative approach to simulating peer review using LLMs and its demonstration of the potential for iterative refinement to enhance the quality of AI-generated reviews. However, the paper also has several limitations, particularly in the clarity of its methodological details and the scope of its experimental evaluation, which I will discuss in detail below. Overall, the paper presents a promising direction for using LLMs to assist in the peer review process, but further work is needed to address the identified weaknesses and fully realize the potential of the PAIR framework.\n",

      "The most compelling strength of this paper is the introduction of the PAIR framework, which offers a novel and potentially transformative approach to scientific peer review. The idea of using a two-agent system, with a critic and a reviewer LLM, to simulate the iterative nature of the review process is both innovative and intuitively appealing. The framework's ability to generate feedback that is comparable to human reviewers, as demonstrated by the experimental results, is a significant achievement. The use of iterative refinement, where the reviewer agent incorporates feedback from the critic agent to improve the quality of its reviews, is a key strength of the approach. The exploration of different feedback modes for the critic agent, including ranking, rejection, and construction, also contributes to the paper's novelty. Furthermore, the authors' efforts to fine-tune a specialized model on high-quality reviews from the Computer Physics Communications journal demonstrate a commitment to improving the performance of the PAIR framework. The experimental results, particularly the improvement in the usefulness score of GPT-4L after iterative refinement, provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The paper also explores the use of reinforcement learning and preference tuning to enhance the performance of the LLM agents, which is a valuable contribution to the field. The paper's focus on improving the quality of AI-generated reviews is particularly relevant in the context of the increasing use of LLMs in scientific research. The authors' efforts to address the limitations of existing LLM-based review systems by incorporating iterative refinement and a critic agent are commendable. The paper is also well-written and easy to understand, which makes it accessible to a broad audience. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the PAIR framework and the experimental setup, and the results are presented in a clear and informative manner. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its innovative approach to simulating peer review using LLMs, its demonstration of the potential for iterative refinement to enhance the quality of AI-generated reviews, and its clear and accessible presentation.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "While the paper presents a promising approach to enhancing peer review with LLMs, several weaknesses need to be addressed. First, the paper lacks a clear and detailed explanation of the \"two-player zero-sum game\" concept, which is central to the PAIR framework. While the paper introduces the concept in the \"Problem Formulation\" section, it does not provide a formal definition of the game, the payoff functions for each agent, or the equilibrium conditions. The description of the critic and reviewer agents, including their specific roles, training methodologies, and interaction protocols, is also insufficient. It is unclear how these agents are implemented, what algorithms are used for their training, and how they interact within the proposed framework. The paper mentions reinforcement learning but does not specify the exact algorithms used for training either the critic or the reviewer agent. The interaction protocol is described in the \"Algorithm\" section, but the underlying mechanisms driving the agents' behavior are not elaborated upon. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to fully understand the underlying mechanisms of the PAIR framework and to reproduce the results. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not provide the necessary details to fully understand the implementation of the zero-sum game or the agent training process. Second, the paper does not provide sufficient details on the fine-tuning process of the specialized model, particularly the CPC agent. While the paper mentions the use of the LoRA method for fine-tuning, along with hyperparameters such as batch size, learning rate, and LoRA dimension, it does not explicitly state the architecture of the model. It is implied that the CPC agent is a fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model, but this is not explicitly stated. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the validity of the experimental results and the reproducibility of the proposed method. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper omits a key detail about the model architecture. Third, the paper's experimental evaluation is primarily limited to the Computer Physics Communications dataset and papers from the AI Index 2023 Annual Report. While the paper mentions using the ReviewGPT dataset for pretraining, the core evaluation of the PAIR framework is centered around the AI Index dataset. This raises concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method to other domains and datasets. The paper should include experiments on other datasets to demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the PAIR framework in different contexts. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's experimental evaluation is indeed primarily focused on a single dataset. Fourth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of the PAIR framework. For example, it is unclear how the framework would perform in situations where the critic agent and the reviewer agent disagree on the quality of a review. The paper does not explicitly address how the framework resolves such disagreements, or if it simply converges on a suboptimal solution. The experimental setup does not specifically test scenarios with disagreement between the agents. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not analyze the framework's behavior in disagreement scenarios. Fifth, the paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of using LLMs to simulate scientific peer reviews. For example, there is a risk that the LLMs could perpetuate existing biases in the peer review process. The paper does not address the potential for the LLMs to be used for malicious purposes, such as generating fake reviews or manipulating the peer review process. It is crucial to propose concrete strategies for mitigating these risks. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper completely omits any discussion of ethical considerations. Finally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational resources required to implement the PAIR framework. While the paper mentions the use of an A100 GPU and the training time for each model, it lacks a detailed breakdown of other computational resources like memory requirements, the number of GPUs needed for parallelization (if applicable), and energy consumption. A more comprehensive analysis of the computational cost would be beneficial for researchers considering implementing the framework. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper omits key details about the computational resources required to implement the framework.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the \"two-player zero-sum game\" concept within the PAIR framework. This should include a formal definition of the game, the payoff functions for each agent, and the equilibrium conditions. The authors should also clarify how the critic and reviewer agents interact within this game, and how their interactions lead to improved review quality. A concrete example of a review scenario, illustrating the agents' interactions and the resulting improvements, would be beneficial. Furthermore, the paper should explicitly state the algorithms used for training each agent, including the loss functions and optimization methods. This level of detail is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms of the PAIR framework and for enabling other researchers to reproduce the results. Second, the authors should provide a comprehensive overview of the model architecture used for the specialized model (CPC agent), including the number of layers, the size of the hidden layers, and the activation functions used. The paper should also specify the size of the dataset used for fine-tuning, the data preprocessing steps, and the hyperparameter settings used during training. The authors should also explain the rationale behind the choices made for the model architecture and the hyperparameter settings. Additionally, the paper should include a discussion of the potential limitations of the fine-tuning process, such as overfitting or bias, and how these limitations were addressed. This level of detail is essential for ensuring the reproducibility of the results and for enabling other researchers to build upon the proposed method. Third, to address the concerns about the generalizability of the proposed method, the authors should include experiments on other datasets, ideally from different domains. This would demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the PAIR framework in different contexts. The paper should also provide a more detailed analysis of the experimental results, including a comparison with existing methods and a discussion of the limitations of the proposed approach. The authors should also consider conducting an ablation study to evaluate the contribution of each component of the PAIR framework. This would provide a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of the proposed method and would help to identify areas for future improvement. Fourth, the authors should delve deeper into the potential failure modes of the PAIR framework, particularly when the critic and reviewer agents produce conflicting assessments. A more rigorous analysis is needed to understand how the framework resolves such disagreements, or if it simply converges on a suboptimal solution. For instance, the authors could explore scenarios where the critic agent is overly critical or lenient, and how this impacts the reviewer agent's learning process. It would be beneficial to include experiments that specifically test the framework's robustness to such imbalances, perhaps by introducing adversarial critic agents or by manipulating the training data to create biased critics. Furthermore, the paper should investigate the impact of different feedback mechanisms on the convergence and quality of the reviews. A detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the framework to various hyperparameters, such as the learning rate and the number of iterations, would also be valuable. Fifth, to address the ethical concerns, the authors should conduct a thorough analysis of potential biases in the training data and the generated reviews. This should include an investigation into whether the LLMs perpetuate existing biases related to gender, race, or institutional affiliation. The paper should also discuss the potential for the LLMs to be used for malicious purposes, such as generating fake reviews or manipulating the peer review process. It is crucial to propose concrete strategies for mitigating these risks, such as incorporating fairness constraints into the training process or developing methods for detecting and filtering out biased reviews. The authors should also consider the broader implications of using LLMs in scientific peer review, such as the potential impact on the careers of early-career researchers and the overall integrity of the scientific process. A discussion of these broader societal implications is essential for responsible innovation. Finally, the paper needs to provide a more detailed breakdown of the computational resources required to implement the PAIR framework. This should include not only the total training time but also the memory requirements, the number of GPUs needed, and the energy consumption. The authors should also discuss the scalability of the framework, and whether it can be used for large-scale peer review tasks. It would be useful to provide a comparison of the computational costs of the PAIR framework with those of traditional peer review processes. This information is crucial for researchers who are considering adopting the framework in their own work, and it will help to assess the practical feasibility of the proposed approach. The authors should also discuss potential optimizations to reduce the computational burden, such as using more efficient training algorithms or smaller models.\n",

      "  Summary: This paper introduces a novel framework for simulating and optimizing scientific peer review using large language models (LLMs). The authors propose two main components: the Scientific Peer Reviewer Agent (SPRA), which simulates peer reviews based on a JSON configuration, and the Human-LLM Reviewer Agent (HLL-RA), which iteratively refines these simulations by incorporating human feedback to better align with human judgment. The SPRA is configured to analyze various components of a scientific paper, such as the abstract, introduction, and methodology, and to identify potential issues like statistical errors or unethical research practices. The HLL-RA then uses human feedback to select the most appropriate reviews, which are subsequently used to fine-tune the LLMs using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This iterative process aims to improve the quality and alignment of the generated reviews with human standards. The authors validate their approach through experiments on the RewardBench benchmark, achieving state-of-the-art performance, and by creating a new synthetic dataset (Syn-RS) of high-quality reviews rated by humans. The core contribution of this work lies in its attempt to automate and enhance the peer review process through LLMs, addressing the challenges of reviewer bias and inefficiency. The paper also introduces a new dataset, Syn-RS, which could serve as a valuable resource for future research in this area. The authors frame their work within the context of Langley's computational model, suggesting a broader aim to enhance scientific discovery through improved peer review. However, the paper's primary focus remains on the simulation and optimization of the peer review process itself, rather than directly contributing to other aspects of scientific discovery. The empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving high performance on the RewardBench benchmark and in generating high-quality synthetic reviews. The paper's approach of using human feedback to iteratively refine LLM-generated reviews is a practical method for improving the alignment of these models with human judgment.

      "  Summary: This paper introduces Multi-Agent Review (MARP), a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate the traditional peer review process. The core idea is to employ multiple LLMs as independent reviewers, each providing feedback on a given research paper. These agents then iteratively refine their reviews by exchanging feedback, ultimately converging on a consensus conclusion. The authors also incorporate an iterative reasoning preference optimization algorithm to fine-tune a reward model, aiming to enhance the accuracy of the final review. The experimental results, conducted on a dataset of papers from NeurIPS 2021, suggest that MARP outperforms single LLM reviews, such as those generated by ChatGPT-3.5, in terms of predicting acceptance decisions. The authors propose that MARP could assist and improve the peer review process in scientific research by providing a more efficient and potentially less biased alternative to traditional methods. The methodology involves a controller agent that manages the review process, and reviewer agents that are configured with specific roles and prompts to evaluate the paper from different perspectives. The iterative feedback mechanism allows the agents to refine their evaluations based on the feedback received from other agents. The reward model is trained to assess the quality of the reviews, guiding the iterative refinement process. The paper's significance lies in its attempt to automate and improve the peer review process using LLMs, which could have implications for the efficiency and objectivity of scientific evaluation. However, the paper also has several limitations that need to be addressed to fully realize its potential.\n",

      "  Summary: This paper introduces RALS (Referees in AI for Scientific Peer Searer Review), an innovative system designed to automate the scientific peer review process using large language models (LLMs). The core idea behind RALS is to simulate the traditional peer review workflow through a four-stage process: reading, analyzing, launching criticisms, and self-refining. In the reading stage, the LLM processes the research paper, summarizing its key points and arguments. The analyzing stage involves a deeper examination of the paper's methodology, results, and conclusions, identifying both strengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, the launching criticisms stage enables the LLM to articulate detailed and specific critiques of the paper's content. Finally, the self-refining stage allows the LLM to iteratively improve its own review by reflecting on its previous outputs and making necessary adjustments. The authors evaluate RALS on a dataset of 169 reviewed AI/ML papers from NeurIPS, ICML, and ACL, demonstrating that RALS can generate high-quality reviews that are often preferred over human reviews by both domain experts and the general public. The authors also explore the potential of RALS as a reward model for scientific discovery, suggesting that it could be used to automate scientific quality control. The paper's findings suggest that LLMs can be effectively used to automate aspects of the peer review process, potentially accelerating scientific validation and discovery. However, the authors acknowledge that further refinement and evaluation are needed to ensure that RALS complements human review without undermining the rigor of scientific validation. The paper's contribution lies in its novel approach to automating peer review and its exploration of the potential for LLMs to revolutionize scientific quality control and discovery. The authors present a compelling case for the feasibility of using LLMs to automate peer review, while also acknowledging the limitations and challenges that need to be addressed before such systems can be widely adopted.\n",

      "  Summary: This paper introduces the AI Reviewer Agent (AIRA), a system designed to simulate human-AI collaboration in the scientific peer review process. The authors propose AIRA as a means to address the challenges of reviewer fatigue and potential biases in the traditional peer review system, which has been strained by the increasing volume of research papers, particularly in the field of deep learning. AIRA operates through a multi-agent framework consisting of a reading agent, a note-taking agent, a feedback summarization agent, and a review generating agent. These agents work sequentially, processing the paper and generating a review. The authors also introduce the AI Review Assessment (AIRA) benchmark, a dataset of over 640 reviews of 94 AI papers from the ICML 2024 conference, which includes both human and AI-generated reviews. This benchmark is intended to facilitate the evaluation of AI reviewer agents. The evaluation process involves a multi-round assessment, where AI-generated reviews are compared to human reviews using a multiple-choice questionnaire. The results indicate that AI reviews improve significantly between rounds, and in some cases, are rated higher than human reviews, particularly by authors. The authors also find that AI reviews tend to be more detailed and specific. The paper's core contribution lies in the introduction of AIRA and the AIRA benchmark, which provides a valuable resource for the research community. The study highlights the potential of AI to assist in the peer review process, demonstrating that AI reviewers can generate high-quality reviews and improve over time. However, the paper also acknowledges the limitations of AIRA, particularly in understanding complex technical details and providing feedback on mathematical accuracy. The authors also note the potential for AI reviewers to introduce biases and the need for further research in this area. Overall, this paper presents a significant step towards automating the peer review process, offering a novel approach to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific peer review.\n",

      "  Summary: This paper introduces a novel approach to automating the scientific peer review process using large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a system called AIReviewer, which is composed of three distinct components: AIReviewer, AIReviewerStar, and AIReviewerPlus. The core idea is to leverage the capabilities of LLMs to simulate and enhance different aspects of the peer review process. AIReviewer serves as the foundational model, designed to simulate the traditional peer review process through multi-turn interactions and iterative optimization. It employs a form of 'order-n' reasoning to analyze input data and generate a latent decision, which is then used to produce a review. AIReviewerStar builds upon this foundation by incorporating Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align the generated reviews with human expert reviews, aiming to improve the quality and relevance of the output. Finally, AIReviewerPlus further refines the process by incorporating author feedback into the review policy optimization, using a combination of reward modeling and DPO to update the model's parameters. The authors evaluate their system on the NeurIPS 2023 dataset, demonstrating that AIReviewer can generate detailed and consistent reviews, while AIReviewerStar outperforms existing LLM-based review systems. AIReviewerPlus shows promise in accelerating the feedback loop between reviewers and authors, suggesting a shift towards a more collaborative and iterative review process. The paper's overall contribution lies in its attempt to automate and enhance the peer review process, potentially leading to more efficient and effective scientific research. The authors present a framework and dataset to evaluate these models on tasks like paper state encoding, review criteria encoding, and review generation. The experimental results, while promising, also highlight areas where further development and refinement are needed. The work aims to improve quality and efficiency of scientific research by automating aspects of peer review, and the authors suggest that their work aligns with the broader goal of creating a unified knowledge market where machines can assume traditional human roles, thereby enhancing the scientific research process. However, the paper also acknowledges the limitations of the current system and the need for further research to address these issues.\n",

      "  Summary: This paper introduces a novel approach to simulating and optimizing the peer review process using large language models (LLMs). The authors have created a Simulated Peer Review (SimPEER) dataset, comprising 2,000 simulated peer review interactions based on machine learning papers from NeurIPS and ICLR conferences. This dataset is a significant contribution, providing a valuable resource for training and evaluating AI-assisted review agents. The core of their methodology involves training an AI researcher agent (ARA) in two stages. First, the ARA undergoes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on high-quality simulations from the SimPEER dataset. This is followed by preference optimization (PO), where the agent is further refined using human preferences for review quality. The resulting agent, named ARA-PO, is then evaluated against commercial LLMs such as GPT-4o and Qwen2.5. The empirical findings demonstrate that ARA-PO outperforms these commercial LLMs in generating high-quality reviews, as assessed by human annotators using a detailed scoring metric. Furthermore, ARA-PO shows competitive performance in identifying accept/merge decisions for ML papers, achieving results comparable to expert-based scores. The authors' work is significant because it addresses the critical challenge of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the peer review process, which is a cornerstone of scientific research. By demonstrating the potential of LLMs to generate high-quality reviews and make informed decisions, this paper contributes to the advancement of automated peer review systems, potentially accelerating the scientific discovery process. The two-stage training approach, combining supervised fine-tuning with preference optimization, is a notable methodological contribution, showcasing how simulated data and human preferences can be leveraged to enhance the performance of AI agents in complex tasks. The creation of the SimPEER dataset and the development of ARA-PO represent a substantial step forward in the application of LLMs to scientific workflows, offering a promising avenue for future research in this area.\n",

      "  Summary: This paper introduces a novel approach to scientific peer review, termed Multi-Paper Benchmarking Review (MPBR), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the review process. The core idea behind MPBR is to evaluate a given paper in the context of other relevant, pre-existing research, referred to as 'benchmarking papers.' This approach aims to foster a more comprehensive and competitive review environment, encouraging the identification of original and significant contributions. The authors propose an agent-based system, comprising reviewer agents and a manager agent, to automate the review process. Reviewer agents generate individual reviews, while the manager agent selects and aggregates the most valuable feedback. The system is trained and evaluated using a newly constructed benchmark dataset derived from real-world reviews of AI conference submissions. The authors demonstrate that MPBR can produce higher-quality reviews, as measured by metrics such as originality, significance, and quality, compared to traditional peer review. They also show that the system can identify methodological flaws and foster knowledge creation. The paper presents a real-world study where the MPBR system was used to review papers submitted to AI conferences, providing further evidence of its practical applicability. The authors claim that their system is self-sustaining, requiring minimal human intervention, and can reduce the costs associated with traditional peer review. Overall, the paper presents a compelling vision for the future of scientific peer review, leveraging the power of LLMs to enhance the quality and efficiency of the process. However, as I will detail, there are several areas where the methodology and evaluation could be strengthened to further validate the proposed approach.\n",

      "  Summary: This paper introduces ReviewGame, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to simulate the scientific review process as a competitive multi-agent game. The core idea is to model the review process as a competition among multiple LLM agents, each acting as a reviewer, with the goal of producing the best review. This approach contrasts with previous single-agent models and aims to better reflect the dynamics of real-world peer review. The framework incorporates author feedback and is explicitly connected to the scientific method, emphasizing the importance of refutation and critical scrutiny. The authors evaluate ReviewGame on the ICLR 2024 submissions, comparing it against GPT-4o and the chain-of-thought (CoT) method. Their empirical findings suggest that ReviewGame outperforms these baselines in terms of review quality, author preference, and alignment with actual review outcomes. The authors claim that their framework has the potential to improve the quality and efficiency of scientific peer review, ultimately accelerating the pace of scientific discovery. The paper's main contribution lies in its innovative approach to modeling peer review as a competitive multi-agent game, and the empirical results provide some support for its effectiveness. However, the paper also has several limitations, particularly in its lack of detailed comparisons with other multi-agent LLM frameworks, its limited analysis of computational resources, and its somewhat overreaching claims about the impact of the framework. Despite these limitations, the paper presents a promising approach to automating and improving the scientific review process.\n",

      "  Summary: This paper introduces two innovative AI-powered agents, AIReviewer and AIResearch, designed to automate scientific peer review and idea generation, respectively. AIReviewer is an interactive system that conducts multi-round reviews of scientific papers, engaging in a dialogue with authors to provide detailed feedback. It leverages a large language model (LLM) to assess paper quality and suggest improvements, aiming to streamline the peer review process. AIResearch, on the other hand, employs a collaborative approach where two AI agents engage in debate-style conversations to generate novel scientific ideas. These ideas are then refined and ranked using a specialized AI4Science Reward Model, trained on preference data from AIReview. The core methodological approach involves training these agents using LLMs and evaluating their performance through comparisons with human reviewers and expert ratings. The empirical findings suggest that AIReviewer can produce reviews comparable in quality to intermediate human reviewers, and AIResearch can efficiently generate novel and high-quality scientific ideas, outperforming the PACCAR model in terms of generation speed and idea quality. The paper also introduces a benchmark dataset of AIReview reviews on ISMRL papers, which can be used for future development of scientific peer review and idea generation models. Overall, the paper presents a significant step towards automating key aspects of the scientific process, with potential implications for research efficiency and collaboration. However, the study also reveals several limitations that need to be addressed to ensure the robustness and generalizability of the proposed systems.\n",

      "  Summary: This paper introduces a novel framework, termed PAIR (Peer Review as Iterative Refinement), designed to enhance the quality of scientific peer reviews using large language models (LLMs). The core idea of PAIR is to simulate the iterative nature of peer review through a two-agent system: a critic LLM and a reviewer LLM. The critic provides feedback on the reviewer's initial review, which the reviewer then uses to refine and improve their assessment. This process is framed as a two-player zero-sum game, although the specifics of this game-theoretic formulation are not fully elaborated. The authors explore different feedback modes for the critic, including ranking, rejection, and construction, and evaluate the impact of these modes on the quality of the generated reviews. They also investigate the use of reinforcement learning and preference tuning to further enhance the performance of both the critic and reviewer agents. The experimental evaluation primarily focuses on papers from the AI Index 2023 Annual Report, with a specialized model fine-tuned on high-quality reviews from the Computer Physics Communications (CPC) journal. The results indicate that the PAIR framework can generate feedback that is comparable to human reviewers, with the GPT-4L model achieving a significant improvement in usefulness score after iterative refinement. The paper's main contribution lies in its innovative approach to simulating peer review using LLMs and its demonstration of the potential for iterative refinement to enhance the quality of AI-generated reviews. However, the paper also has several limitations, particularly in the clarity of its methodological details and the scope of its experimental evaluation, which I will discuss in detail below. Overall, the paper presents a promising direction for using LLMs to assist in the peer review process, but further work is needed to address the identified weaknesses and fully realize the potential of the PAIR framework.\n",

    "## 6. Conclusion and Further Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you've learned how to use DeepReviewer to generate automated peer reviews, explore different review modes, and parse the structured output. DeepReviewer offers a powerful and flexible way to leverage the capabilities of large language models for scientific paper evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations and Ethical Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Not a Replacement for Human Review:** DeepReviewer is a tool to *assist* with peer review, not to replace the critical thinking and expertise of human reviewers.\n",
    "*   **Potential for Bias:**  Like all LLMs, DeepReviewer can inherit biases from its training data.  Be mindful of this when interpreting the results.\n",
    "*   **Over-Reliance:**  Avoid over-reliance on automated feedback.  Always critically evaluate the generated reviews.\n",
    "* **Transparency:** If using DeepReviewer in your work, disclose its use transparently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Exploration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Experiment with different papers:**  Try DeepReviewer with your own research papers or papers from various fields.\n",
    "*   **Adjust parameters:**  Explore the effects of `reviewer_num` and `max_tokens`.\n",
    "*   **Explore the vLLM documentation:**  Learn more about the underlying inference engine for advanced usage.\n",
    "*   **Contribute to the project:**  If you find issues or have suggestions, consider contributing to the DeepReviewer project (if it's open-source).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for exploring DeepReviewer! We hope this tutorial has been helpful."
