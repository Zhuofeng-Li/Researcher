      "This paper introduces a two-stage training method aimed at enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs). The proposed approach begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a domain-specific dataset, followed by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The authors claim that this combination leverages the strengths of both techniques, resulting in significant performance improvements on several benchmark datasets. However, the paper's high-level description and lack of specific details make it challenging to fully assess the novelty and robustness of the method. The empirical findings suggest state-of-the-art results, but the absence of comparisons to a standard end-to-end approach and detailed implementation information limits the ability to validate these claims. Overall, while the paper presents a promising direction for LLM training, the lack of technical depth and comprehensive evaluation undermines its significance and impact.\n",

      "One of the primary concerns I have with this paper is the limited technical innovation in the proposed method. The combination of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a well-established paradigm in the field of large language models (LLMs). While the paper claims a novel training method, it essentially describes the standard practice of first adapting the model to a specific domain through SFT and then refining it using RLHF. This sequential application of SFT and RLHF, without any novel modifications or insights, does not constitute a significant technical contribution. The method section provides a high-level overview but lacks specific algorithms, loss functions, or implementation details that could differentiate this approach from existing methods. For instance, the paper does not describe any unique aspects of the reward function used in RLHF or any specific techniques for domain-specific fine-tuning. This absence of technical depth makes it difficult to assess the novelty and impact of the proposed method. I am confident in this assessment based on the paper's content and the common practices in the field. The lack of innovation is a critical issue, as it undermines the paper's claim of introducing a new and effective training method. Furthermore, the paper's claim of significant performance improvements is not sufficiently supported by the presented results. The results section states that the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets X, Y, and Z, but it does not provide a detailed comparison to a baseline method that combines SFT and RLHF without the proposed modifications. This omission is problematic because it leaves open the possibility that the observed improvements are not due to the proposed method but rather to the standard combination of SFT and RLHF. Additionally, the paper does not address the potential confounding factor of increased training time or data usage. Without a comparison to a baseline trained for the same duration or with the same amount of data, it is impossible to determine if the performance gains are genuinely attributable to the method itself. The lack of an ablation study further complicates the evaluation, as it is unclear how much each stage (SFT and RLHF) contributes to the final performance. These issues significantly impact the paper's conclusions and the validity of its claims. I am highly confident in this assessment, as the paper's results section is too brief and lacks the necessary comparative analysis to substantiate the performance improvements. Finally, the paper suffers from poor writing quality, which hinders its overall impact. The structure is unconventional, with the conclusion preceding the references, and the lack of detail in each section makes it difficult to follow the authors' reasoning and methodology. The absence of visual aids, such as diagrams or tables, further exacerbates the issue, as these could have provided a clearer illustration of the method and results. The poor writing quality is evident throughout the paper and is a significant barrier to understanding and evaluating the proposed method. I am highly confident in this assessment, as the structural and stylistic issues are apparent and detract from the paper's readability and clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To address the identified weaknesses, the authors should significantly expand the technical details of their proposed method. Specifically, they should provide a clear and detailed description of the algorithms used for both the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. This includes specifying the loss functions, the architecture of the reward model, and any unique techniques or modifications introduced in the method. For example, if the authors used a specific type of reward function or a novel approach to domain-specific fine-tuning, these details should be explicitly stated and justified. Additionally, the authors should conduct a more comprehensive empirical evaluation to validate their claims of significant performance improvements. This involves comparing the proposed method to a baseline that combines SFT and RLHF without the proposed modifications, ensuring that both methods are trained for the same duration and with the same amount of data. An ablation study should be included to demonstrate the individual contributions of the SFT and RLHF stages to the final performance. This would help to clarify whether the observed improvements are genuinely due to the proposed method or other factors. The authors should also consider including visual aids, such as diagrams and tables, to better illustrate the method and results. A flowchart or detailed algorithm description could provide a clearer understanding of the training process, and tables comparing the performance of the proposed method with existing approaches on various benchmarks would make the results more concrete and easier to interpret. Furthermore, the paper should be restructured to follow a more conventional format, with the references section placed before the conclusion. Each section should be expanded to provide a more comprehensive description of the method, experiments, and results. The authors should also consider adding a discussion of the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future research. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the method and its place within the broader field of LLM research. By implementing these suggestions, the authors can significantly enhance the technical depth, empirical rigor, and overall clarity of their paper, making it a more valuable contribution to the field.\n",

Specifically, they should provide a clear and detailed description of the algorithms used for both the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages. This includes specifying the loss functions, the architecture of the reward model, and any unique techniques or modifications introduced in the method. For example, if the authors used a specific type of reward function or a novel approach to domain-specific fine-tuning, these details should be explicitly stated and justified. Additionally, the authors should conduct a more comprehensive empirical evaluation to validate their claims of significant performance improvements. This involves comparing the proposed method to a baseline that combines SFT and RLHF without the proposed modifications, ensuring that both methods are trained for the same duration and with the same amount of data. An ablation study should be included to demonstrate the individual contributions of the SFT and RLHF stages to the final performance. This would help to clarify whether the observed improvements are genuinely due to the proposed method or other factors. The authors should also consider including visual aids, such as diagrams and tables, to better illustrate the method and results. A flowchart or detailed algorithm description could provide a clearer understanding of the training process, and tables comparing the performance of the proposed method with existing approaches on various benchmarks would make the results more concrete and easier to interpret. Furthermore, the paper should be restructured to follow a more conventional format, with the references section placed before the conclusion. Each section should be expanded to provide a more comprehensive description of the method, experiments, and results. The authors should also consider adding a discussion of the limitations of their approach and potential avenues for future research. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the method and its place within the broader field of LLM research. By implementing these suggestions, the authors can significantly enhance the technical depth, empirical rigor, and overall clarity of their paper, making it a more valuable contribution to the field.\n",

      "This paper lacks significant contributions. The proposed method is simply a combination of SFT and RLHF, without any novel insights or improvements. The paper fails to articulate any specific advantages of this combination, such as computational efficiency, cost reduction, improved performance, or faster convergence. The approach is essentially equivalent to applying SFT first and then RLHF, which is a common practice. The authors have not introduced any new techniques or modifications to the existing methods. The paper lacks any technical depth or innovative ideas. The writing is clear but lacks substance, and the experimental section is also insufficient to support any significant conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve this work, the authors should focus on identifying specific challenges or limitations in existing SFT and RLHF pipelines and then propose a method that directly addresses these issues. For example, they could explore techniques to reduce the computational cost of RLHF by using more efficient optimization algorithms or by leveraging techniques like knowledge distillation to transfer the learned policy to a smaller model. Alternatively, they could investigate methods to improve the stability and convergence of RLHF, such as using different reward shaping techniques or by incorporating regularization terms into the loss function. The key is to introduce a novel modification or combination of existing techniques that provides a tangible benefit over standard practices. Simply combining SFT and RLHF without any modifications does not constitute a significant contribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the experimental results. This should include a comparison with existing methods on a wider range of datasets and tasks, as well as an analysis of the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance of the proposed method. The experimental section should also include ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each component of the proposed method. For example, the authors could compare the performance of the proposed method with a baseline that uses only SFT or only RLHF. This would help to isolate the specific contribution of the proposed method and to identify the conditions under which it performs best. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations of the proposed method and suggest directions for future research.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the authors should clearly articulate the novelty and significance of their work. They should explain why their method is different from existing approaches and what specific advantages it offers. The introduction and conclusion should be rewritten to clearly state the research question, the proposed method, and the main findings of the study. The authors should also discuss the broader implications of their work and how it contributes to the field of LLM research. Without a clear articulation of the novelty and significance of the work, it is difficult to justify its publication.\n",

      "This paper introduces a method for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) by combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The authors propose a two-stage training process where the LLM is first fine-tuned on a domain-specific dataset using supervised learning, and then further refined using reinforcement learning to align its outputs with human preferences. The method section describes the standard cross-entropy loss used for SFT and a policy gradient method for RLHF, including the formulation of the reward function. The experimental section presents results from two experiments: one on a sentiment analysis task (Dataset X) and another on a question-answering task (Dataset Y). In both experiments, the proposed method outperforms traditional SFT and RL without human feedback, as measured by accuracy and F1 score. The paper concludes by stating that the proposed method, combining SFT and RLHF, achieves significant improvements on benchmark datasets. While the paper presents a promising approach, it lacks crucial details and comparisons that are necessary to fully assess its contribution and significance. The core idea of combining SFT and RLHF is not novel, and the paper does not adequately discuss the specific implementation details or compare it to existing methods that use similar approaches. The experimental evaluation, while showing positive results, is limited in scope and lacks the depth needed to fully validate the method's effectiveness across different LLMs and tasks. Overall, the paper presents a potentially valuable method but requires significant improvements in its presentation, analysis, and comparison to existing work to be considered a substantial contribution to the field.\n",

      "The paper's primary strength lies in its clear articulation of a two-stage training method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This approach is logically sound and aligns with established practices in the field of large language model training. The method section provides a concise overview of both SFT and RLHF, including the loss functions and optimization techniques used. The use of cross-entropy loss for SFT and a policy gradient method for RLHF are standard practices, and the paper clearly describes these. Furthermore, the experimental section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on two different tasks: sentiment analysis and question answering. The results show that the proposed method outperforms both traditional SFT and RL without human feedback, as measured by accuracy and F1 score. This provides empirical evidence that the combination of SFT and RLHF can lead to improved performance. The paper also provides a high-level workflow that summarizes the steps involved in the proposed method, which is helpful for understanding the overall process. The inclusion of specific examples within the method details, such as the sentiment analysis example for SFT and the question answering example for RLHF, aids in understanding the practical application of the method. While the core idea of combining SFT and RLHF is not novel, the paper's clear presentation of the method and its empirical validation on two different tasks are positive aspects that contribute to its overall value. The paper also provides a clear structure, which makes it easy to follow the different stages of the proposed method and the experimental setup. The use of standard metrics such as accuracy and F1 score allows for easy comparison with other studies in the field.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "My primary concern with this paper is the lack of detail in the description of the proposed method, which makes it difficult to fully understand its novelty and specific implementation. While the paper outlines the two-stage process of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), it lacks crucial specifics on how these stages are combined and optimized. For instance, the paper mentions using a standard cross-entropy loss for SFT and a policy gradient method for RLHF, but it does not delve into any specific modifications or novel techniques used in their combination. This lack of detail makes it challenging to distinguish this method from existing approaches that also combine SFT and RLHF. The paper also lacks a dedicated 'Related Work' section, which is a significant omission. Without a thorough discussion of existing methods, it is difficult to assess the novelty and contribution of the proposed approach. Specifically, the paper fails to mention or compare its method to relevant works such as LlaSMaIL, which also explores instruction-tuned LLMs, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm. The absence of these comparisons leaves the reader wondering how this method differs from existing practices and what specific advantages it offers. The paper's conclusion is also very brief and lacks in-depth discussion of the results or insights. While the 'analysis' subsections within the 'Experiments' section offer some interpretation of the numerical results, they do not provide a comprehensive discussion of the implications of these findings or their broader significance. This lack of detailed discussion limits the impact of the paper and leaves many questions unanswered. Furthermore, the experimental evaluation is not comprehensive enough to fully validate the method's effectiveness. The paper presents results from two experiments, one on sentiment analysis and another on question answering, but it does not provide sufficient detail about the datasets used. The paper mentions 'Dataset X' and 'Dataset Y' without providing specific information about their size, composition, or source. The lack of detail about the datasets makes it difficult to assess the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the paper mentions 'Dataset Z' in the abstract and introduction but does not provide any experimental results or analysis for this dataset. This inconsistency between the claims in the abstract and the actual experiments further weakens the paper's credibility. The paper also does not specify which large language model was used in the experiments, which is a critical omission. The performance of different LLMs can vary significantly, and without this information, it is impossible to assess the generalizability of the results across different models. Finally, the paper does not include any ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each component of the proposed method. For example, it would be beneficial to compare the performance of the proposed method with a baseline that uses only SFT or only RLHF. This would help to isolate the specific contribution of the proposed method and to identify the conditions under which it performs best. The lack of such analysis limits the paper's ability to provide a thorough understanding of the proposed method's effectiveness. In summary, the paper suffers from a lack of detail in the method description, a missing related work section, a limited experimental evaluation, and a lack of ablation studies. These weaknesses significantly impact the paper's credibility and make it difficult to assess its contribution to the field. My confidence in these identified limitations is high, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and the absence of crucial information.\n",

      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To significantly improve this paper, I recommend several concrete and actionable changes. First and foremost, the authors must provide a more detailed description of their proposed method. This should include a thorough explanation of how the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages are combined and optimized. Specifically, the authors should clarify if they are using any novel techniques or modifications to the standard SFT and RLHF algorithms. They should also provide details on the reward function used in the RLHF stage, including how it is formulated and optimized. This level of detail is crucial for understanding the method's novelty and for enabling other researchers to reproduce the results. Second, the paper needs a comprehensive 'Related Work' section. This section should discuss existing methods that combine SFT and RLHF, including relevant works such as LlaSMaIL and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The authors should clearly articulate how their method differs from these existing approaches and what specific advantages it offers. This comparison is essential for establishing the paper's contribution and for placing it within the context of the existing literature. Third, the experimental evaluation needs to be significantly expanded. The authors should provide more details about the datasets used in their experiments, including their size, composition, and source. They should also include results for 'Dataset Z', which is mentioned in the abstract and introduction. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate their method on a wider range of tasks and datasets to demonstrate its generalizability. It would also be beneficial to evaluate the method across different LLMs to assess its robustness. The authors should also include ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each component of the proposed method. For example, they should compare the performance of the proposed method with baselines that use only SFT or only RLHF. This would help to isolate the specific contribution of the proposed method and to identify the conditions under which it performs best. Fourth, the paper needs a more in-depth discussion of the results and insights. The conclusion should be expanded to include a thorough analysis of the experimental findings and their broader implications. The authors should discuss the limitations of their method and suggest directions for future research. They should also provide a more detailed analysis of the error cases and discuss the potential reasons for these errors. Finally, the authors should ensure that the paper is well-written and easy to understand. The language should be clear and concise, and the technical terms should be defined clearly. The paper should also be carefully proofread to eliminate any grammatical errors or typos. By addressing these weaknesses, the authors can significantly improve the quality and impact of their paper. These suggestions are concrete and actionable, and they are directly connected to the identified weaknesses. Implementing these changes will result in a more rigorous and compelling paper that makes a more substantial contribution to the field.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for understanding the paper's methodology and results. First, I am curious about the specific details of how the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages are integrated. The paper describes these stages sequentially, but I would like to know if there is any specific logic or optimization involved in their combination. For example, are the models initialized from the SFT stage used directly in the RLHF stage, or is there any further modification? Also, what are the specific hyperparameters used in each stage, and how were they chosen? Second, I am interested in the details of the reward function used in the RLHF stage. The paper mentions that the reward function is based on human feedback, but I would like to know how this feedback is collected and processed. What are the specific criteria used to evaluate the quality of the generated text, and how are these criteria translated into a numerical reward? Also, are there any specific techniques used to stabilize the training process, such as reward clipping or normalization? Third, I would like to know why the paper does not include a comparison to existing methods that combine SFT and RLHF, such as LlaSMaIL and PPO. What are the specific reasons for not including these comparisons, and how does the proposed method differ from these existing approaches? I believe that a thorough comparison to these methods is essential for understanding the novelty and contribution of the proposed method. Fourth, I am curious about the choice of datasets used in the experiments. The paper mentions 'Dataset X', 'Dataset Y', and 'Dataset Z', but it does not provide sufficient details about their size, composition, or source. Why were these specific datasets chosen, and how representative are they of the broader tasks that the method is intended to address? Also, why are the results for 'Dataset Z' not included in the experimental section? Finally, I would like to know what specific large language model was used in the experiments. The paper mentions using a 'large pre-trained language model' but does not specify which one. What is the reason for not specifying the model, and how would the results vary if a different LLM was used? These questions target the core methodological choices and assumptions of the paper, and I believe that answering them is crucial for a complete understanding of the proposed method and its results.\n",

      "This paper lacks significant contributions. The proposed method is simply a combination of SFT and RLHF, without any novel insights or improvements. The paper fails to articulate any specific advantages of this combination, such as computational efficiency, cost reduction, improved performance, or faster convergence. The approach is essentially equivalent to applying SFT first and then RLHF, which is a common practice. The authors have not introduced any new techniques or modifications to the existing methods. The paper lacks any technical depth or innovative ideas. The writing is clear but lacks substance, and the experimental section is also insufficient to support any significant conclusions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Suggestions\n",
      "\n",
      "To improve this work, the authors should focus on identifying specific challenges or limitations in existing SFT and RLHF pipelines and then propose a method that directly addresses these issues. For example, they could explore techniques to reduce the computational cost of RLHF by using more efficient optimization algorithms or by leveraging techniques like knowledge distillation to transfer the learned policy to a smaller model. Alternatively, they could investigate methods to improve the stability and convergence of RLHF, such as using different reward shaping techniques or by incorporating regularization terms into the loss function. The key is to introduce a novel modification or combination of existing techniques that provides a tangible benefit over standard practices. Simply combining SFT and RLHF without any modifications does not constitute a significant contribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the experimental results. This should include a comparison with existing methods on a wider range of datasets and tasks, as well as an analysis of the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance of the proposed method. The experimental section should also include ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each component of the proposed method. For example, the authors could compare the performance of the proposed method with a baseline that uses only SFT or only RLHF.

      "\n",
      "This paper introduces a method for enhancing the performance of large language models (LLMs) by combining supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The authors propose a two-stage training process where the LLM is first fine-tuned on a domain-specific dataset using supervised learning, and then further refined using reinforcement learning to align its outputs with human preferences. The method section describes the standard cross-entropy loss used for SFT and a policy gradient method for RLHF, including the formulation of the reward function. The experimental section presents results from two experiments: one on a sentiment analysis task (Dataset X) and another on a question-answering task (Dataset Y). In both experiments, the proposed method outperforms traditional SFT and RL without human feedback, as measured by accuracy and F1 score. The paper concludes by stating that the proposed method, combining SFT and RLHF, achieves significant improvements on benchmark datasets. While the paper presents a promising approach, it lacks crucial details and comparisons that are necessary to fully assess its contribution and significance. The core idea of combining SFT and RLHF is not novel, and the paper does not adequately discuss the specific implementation details or compare it to existing methods that use similar approaches. The experimental evaluation, while showing positive results, is limited in scope and lacks the depth needed to fully validate the method's effectiveness across different LLMs and tasks. Overall, the paper presents a potentially valuable method but requires significant improvements in its presentation, analysis, and comparison to existing work to be considered a substantial contribution to the field.\n",

      "The paper's primary strength lies in its clear articulation of a two-stage training method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This approach is logically sound and aligns with established practices in the field of large language model training. The method section provides a concise overview of both SFT and RLHF, including the loss functions and optimization techniques used. The use of cross-entropy loss for SFT and a policy gradient method for RLHF are standard practices, and the paper clearly describes these. Furthermore, the experimental section demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method on two different tasks: sentiment analysis and question answering. The results show that the proposed method outperforms both traditional SFT and RL without human feedback, as measured by accuracy and F1 score. This provides empirical evidence that the combination of SFT and RLHF can lead to improved performance. The paper also provides a high-level workflow that summarizes the steps involved in the proposed method, which is helpful for understanding the overall process. The inclusion of specific examples within the method details, such as the sentiment analysis example for SFT and the question answering example for RLHF, aids in understanding the practical application of the method. While the core idea of combining SFT and RLHF is not novel, the paper's clear presentation of the method and its empirical validation on two different tasks are positive aspects that contribute to its overall value. The paper also provides a clear structure, which makes it easy to follow the different stages of the proposed method and the experimental setup. The use of standard metrics such as accuracy and F1 score allows for easy comparison with other studies in the field.\n",

      "## Weaknesses:\n",
      "\n",
      "My primary concern with this paper is the lack of detail in the description of the proposed method, which makes it difficult to fully understand its novelty and specific implementation. While the paper outlines the two-stage process of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), it lacks crucial specifics on how these stages are combined and optimized. For instance, the paper mentions using a standard cross-entropy loss for SFT and a policy gradient method for RLHF, but it does not delve into any specific modifications or novel techniques used in their combination. This lack of detail makes it challenging to distinguish this method from existing approaches that also combine SFT and RLHF. The paper also lacks a dedicated 'Related Work' section, which is a significant omission. Without a thorough discussion of existing methods, it is difficult to assess the novelty and contribution of the proposed approach. Specifically, the paper fails to mention or compare its method to relevant works such as LlaSMaIL, which also explores instruction-tuned LLMs, and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a widely used reinforcement learning algorithm. The absence of these comparisons leaves the reader wondering how this method differs from existing practices and what specific advantages it offers. The paper's conclusion is also very brief and lacks in-depth discussion of the results or insights. While the 'analysis' subsections within the 'Experiments' section offer some interpretation of the numerical results, they do not provide a comprehensive discussion of the implications of these findings or their broader significance. This lack of detailed discussion limits the impact of the paper and leaves many questions unanswered. Furthermore, the experimental evaluation is not comprehensive enough to fully validate the method's effectiveness. The paper presents results from two experiments, one on sentiment analysis and another on question answering, but it does not provide sufficient detail about the datasets used. The paper mentions 'Dataset X' and 'Dataset Y' without providing specific information about their size, composition, or source. The lack of detail about the datasets makes it difficult to assess the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the paper mentions 'Dataset Z' in the abstract and introduction but does not provide any experimental results or analysis for this dataset. This inconsistency between the claims in the abstract and the actual experiments further weakens the paper's credibility. The paper also does not specify which large language model was used in the experiments, which is a critical omission. The performance of different LLMs can vary significantly, and without this information, it is impossible to assess the generalizability of the results across different models. Finally, the paper does not include any ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each component of the proposed method. For example, it would be beneficial to compare the performance of the proposed method with a baseline that uses only SFT or only RLHF. This would help to isolate the specific contribution of the proposed method and to identify the conditions under which it performs best. The lack of such analysis limits the paper's ability to provide a thorough understanding of the proposed method's effectiveness. In summary, the paper suffers from a lack of detail in the method description, a missing related work section, a limited experimental evaluation, and a lack of ablation studies. These weaknesses significantly impact the paper's credibility and make it difficult to assess its contribution to the field. My confidence in these identified limitations is high, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and the absence of crucial information.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "## Suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "To significantly improve this paper, I recommend several concrete and actionable changes. First and foremost, the authors must provide a more detailed description of their proposed method. This should include a thorough explanation of how the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages are combined and optimized. Specifically, the authors should clarify if they are using any novel techniques or modifications to the standard SFT and RLHF algorithms. They should also provide details on the reward function used in the RLHF stage, including how it is formulated and optimized. This level of detail is crucial for understanding the method's novelty and for enabling other researchers to reproduce the results. Second, the paper needs a comprehensive 'Related Work' section. This section should discuss existing methods that combine SFT and RLHF, including relevant works such as LlaSMaIL and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). The authors should clearly articulate how their method differs from these existing approaches and what specific advantages it offers. This comparison is essential for establishing the paper's contribution and for placing it within the context of the existing literature. Third, the experimental evaluation needs to be significantly expanded. The authors should provide more details about the datasets used in their experiments, including their size, composition, and source. They should also include results for 'Dataset Z', which is mentioned in the abstract and introduction. Furthermore, the authors should evaluate their method on a wider range of tasks and datasets to demonstrate its generalizability. It would also be beneficial to evaluate the method across different LLMs to assess its robustness. The authors should also include ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each component of the proposed method. For example, they should compare the performance of the proposed method with baselines that use only SFT or only RLHF. This would help to isolate the specific contribution of the proposed method and to identify the conditions under which it performs best. Fourth, the paper needs a more in-depth discussion of the results and insights. The conclusion should be expanded to include a thorough analysis of the experimental findings and their broader implications. The authors should discuss the limitations of their method and suggest directions for future research. They should also provide a more detailed analysis of the error cases and discuss the potential reasons for these errors. Finally, the authors should ensure that the paper is well-written and easy to understand. The language should be clear and concise, and the technical terms should be defined clearly. The paper should also be carefully proofread to eliminate any grammatical errors or typos. By addressing these weaknesses, the authors can significantly improve the quality and impact of their paper. These suggestions are concrete and actionable, and they are directly connected to the identified weaknesses. Implementing these changes will result in a more rigorous and compelling paper that makes a more substantial contribution to the field.\n",

      "## Questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for understanding the paper's methodology and results. First, I am curious about the specific details of how the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) stages are integrated. The paper describes these stages sequentially, but I would like to know if there is any specific logic or optimization involved in their combination. For example, are the models initialized from the SFT stage used directly in the RLHF stage, or is there any further modification? Also, what are the specific hyperparameters used in each stage, and how were they chosen? Second, I am interested in the details of the reward function used in the RLHF stage. The paper mentions that the reward function is based on human feedback, but I would like to know how this feedback is collected and processed. What are the specific criteria used to evaluate the quality of the generated text, and how are these criteria translated into a numerical reward? Also, are there any specific techniques used to stabilize the training process, such as reward clipping or normalization? Third, I would like to know why the paper does not include a comparison to existing methods that combine SFT and RLHF, such as LlaSMaIL and PPO. What are the specific reasons for not including these comparisons, and how does the proposed method differ from these existing approaches? I believe that a thorough comparison to these methods is essential for understanding the novelty and contribution of the proposed method. Fourth, I am curious about the choice of datasets used in the experiments. The paper mentions 'Dataset X', 'Dataset Y', and 'Dataset Z', but it does not provide sufficient details about their size, composition, or source. Why were these specific datasets chosen, and how representative are they of the broader tasks that the method is intended to address? Also, why are the results for 'Dataset Z' not included in the experimental section? Finally, I would like to know what specific large language model was used in the experiments. The paper mentions using a 'large pre-trained language model' but does not specify which one. What is the reason for not specifying the model, and how would the results vary if a different LLM was used? These questions target the core methodological choices and assumptions of the paper, and I believe that answering them is crucial for a complete understanding of the proposed method and its results.\n",

    "## 6. Conclusion and Further Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you've learned how to use DeepReviewer to generate automated peer reviews, explore different review modes, and parse the structured output. DeepReviewer offers a powerful and flexible way to leverage the capabilities of large language models for scientific paper evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations and Ethical Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Not a Replacement for Human Review:** DeepReviewer is a tool to *assist* with peer review, not to replace the critical thinking and expertise of human reviewers.\n",
    "*   **Potential for Bias:**  Like all LLMs, DeepReviewer can inherit biases from its training data.  Be mindful of this when interpreting the results.\n",
    "*   **Over-Reliance:**  Avoid over-reliance on automated feedback.  Always critically evaluate the generated reviews.\n",
    "* **Transparency:** If using DeepReviewer in your work, disclose its use transparently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Further Exploration:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Experiment with different papers:**  Try DeepReviewer with your own research papers or papers from various fields.\n",
    "*   **Adjust parameters:**  Explore the effects of `reviewer_num` and `max_tokens`.\n",
    "*   **Explore the vLLM documentation:**  Learn more about the underlying inference engine for advanced usage.\n",
    "*   **Contribute to the project:**  If you find issues or have suggestions, consider contributing to the DeepReviewer project (if it's open-source).\n",
    "\n",
    "Thank you for exploring DeepReviewer! We hope this tutorial has been helpful."
