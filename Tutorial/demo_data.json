        "abstract": "Social media abounds with multimodal sarcasm, and identifying sarcasm targets is particularly challenging due to the implicit incongruity not directly evident in the text and image modalities. Current methods for Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification (MSTI) predominantly focus on superficial indicators in an end-to-end manner, overlooking the nuanced understanding of multimodal sarcasm conveyed through both the text and image. This paper proposes a versatile MSTI framework with a coarse-to-fine paradigm, by augmenting sarcasm explainability with reasoning and pre-training knowledge. Inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on multimodal reasoning, we first engage LMMs to generate competing rationales for coarser-grained pre-training of a small language model on multimodal sarcasm detection. We then propose fine-tuning the model for finer-grained sarcasm target identification. Our framework is thus empowered to adeptly unveil the intricate targets within multimodal sarcasm and mitigate the negative impact posed by potential noise inherently in LMMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our model far outperforms state-of-the-art MSTI methods, and markedly exhibits explainability in deciphering sarcasm as well.\n",

                "abstract": "The exponential growth of social media has profoundly transformed how information is created, disseminated, and absorbed, exceeding any precedent in the digital age. Regrettably, this explosion has also spawned a significant increase in the online abuse of memes. Evaluating the negative impact of memes is notably challenging, owing to their often subtle and implicit meanings, which are not directly conveyed through the overt text and imagery. In light of this, large multimodal models (LMMs) have emerged as a focal point of interest due to their remarkable capabilities in handling diverse multimodal tasks. In response to this development, our paper aims to thoroughly examine the capacity of various LMMs (e.g., GPT-4V) to discern and respond to the nuanced aspects of social abuse manifested in memes. We introduce the comprehensive meme benchmark, GOAT-Bench, comprising over 6K varied memes encapsulating themes such as implicit hate speech, sexism, and cyberbullying, etc. Utilizing GOAT-Bench, we delve into the ability of LMMs to accurately assess hatefulness, misogyny, offensiveness, sarcasm, and harmful content. Our extensive experiments across a range of LMMs reveal that current models still exhibit a deficiency in safety awareness, showing insensitivity to various forms of implicit abuse. We posit that this shortfall represents a critical impediment to the realization of safe artificial intelligence. The GOAT-Bench and accompanying resources are publicly accessible at https://goatlmm.github.io/, contributing to ongoing research in this vital field."

                "abstract": "In recent years, we witness the explosion of false and unconfirmed information (i.e., rumors) that went viral on social media and shocked the public. Rumors can trigger versatile, mostly controversial stance expressions among social media users. Rumor verification and stance detection are different yet relevant tasks. Fake news debunking primarily focuses on determining the truthfulness of news articles, which oversimplifies the issue as fake news often combines elements of both truth and falsehood. Thus, it becomes crucial to identify specific instances of misinformation within the articles. In this research, we investigate a novel task in the field of fake news debunking, which involves detecting sentence-level misinformation. One of the major challenges in this task is the absence of a training dataset with sentence-level annotations regarding veracity. Inspired by the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) approach, we propose a model called Weakly Supervised Detection of Misinforming Sentences (WSDMS). This model only requires bag-level labels for training but is capable of inferring both sentence-level misinformation and article-level veracity, aided by relevant social media conversations that are attentively contextualized with news sentences. We evaluate WSDMS on three real-world benchmarks and demonstrate that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines in debunking fake news at both the sentence and article levels."

In this paper, we analyze the latest model, GPT-4V(ision), to deepen the understanding of LMMs. The analysis focuses on the intriguing tasks that GPT-4V can perform, containing test samples to probe the quality and genericity of GPT-4V's capabilities, its supported inputs and working modes, and the effective ways to prompt the model. In our approach to exploring GPT-4V, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed qualitative samples spanning a variety of domains and tasks. Observations from these samples demonstrate that GPT-4V's unprecedented ability in processing arbitrarily interleaved multimodal inputs and the genericity of its capabilities together make GPT-4V a powerful multimodal generalist system. Furthermore, GPT-4V's unique capability of understanding visual markers drawn on input images can give rise to new human-computer interaction methods such as visual referring prompting. We conclude the report with in-depth discussions on the emerging application scenarios and the future research directions for GPT-4V-based systems. We hope that this preliminary exploration will inspire future research on the next-generation multimodal task formulation, new ways to exploit and enhance LMMs to solve real-world problems, and gaining better understanding of multimodal foundation models.

Nevertheless, the existing benchmark (MMSD) has some shortcomings that hinder the development of reliable multi-modal sarcasm detection system: (1) There are some spurious cues in MMSD, leading to the model bias learning; (2) The negative samples in MMSD are not always reasonable. To solve the aforementioned issues, we introduce MMSD2.0, a correction dataset that fixes the shortcomings of MMSD, by removing the spurious cues and re-annotating the unreasonable samples. Meanwhile, we present a novel framework called multi-view CLIP that is capable of leveraging multi-grained cues from multiple perspectives (i.e., text, image, and text-image interaction view) for multi-modal sarcasm detection. Extensive experiments show that MMSD2.0 is a valuable benchmark for building reliable multi-modal sarcasm detection systems and multi-view CLIP can significantly outperform the previous best baselines."

However, building general-purpose vision-language models is challenging due to the rich input distributions and task diversity resulting from the additional visual input. Although vision-language pretraining has been widely studied, vision-language instruction tuning remains under-explored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic and comprehensive study on vision-language instruction tuning based on the pretrained BLIP-2 models. We gather 26 publicly available datasets, covering a wide variety of tasks and capabilities, and transform them into instruction tuning format. Additionally, we introduce an instruction-aware Query Transformer, which extracts informative features tailored to the given instruction. Trained on 13 held-in datasets, InstructBLIP attains state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across all 13 held-out datasets, substantially outperforming BLIP-2 and larger Flamingo models. Our models also lead to state-of-the-art performance when finetuned on individual downstream tasks (e.g., 90.7% accuracy on ScienceQA questions with image contexts).

However, manually creating such instruction data is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, humans may struggle to produce high-complexity instructions. In this paper, we show an avenue for creating large amounts of instruction data with varying levels of complexity using LLM instead of humans. Starting with an initial set of instructions, we use our proposed Evol-Instruct to rewrite them step by step into more complex instructions. Then, we mix all generated instruction data to fine-tune LLaMA. We call the resulting model WizardLM. Human evaluations on a complexity-balanced test bed and Vicuna's testset show that instructions from Evol-Instruct are superior to human-created ones. By analyzing the human evaluation results of the high complexity part, we demonstrate that outputs from our WizardLM are preferred to outputs from OpenAI ChatGPT. In GPT-4 automatic evaluation, WizardLM achieves more than 90\\% capacity of ChatGPT on 17 out of 29 skills.

The key solution of open-set object detection is introducing language to a closed-set detector for open-set concept generalization. To effectively fuse language and vision modalities, we conceptually divide a closed-set detector into three phases and propose a tight fusion solution, which includes a feature enhancer, a language-guided query selection, and a cross-modality decoder for cross-modality fusion. While previous works mainly evaluate open-set object detection on novel categories, we propose to also perform evaluations on referring expression comprehension for objects specified with attributes. Grounding DINO performs remarkably well on all three settings, including benchmarks on COCO, LVIS, ODinW, and RefCOCO/+/g. Grounding DINO achieves a $52.5$ AP on the COCO detection zero-shot transfer benchmark, i.e., without any training data from COCO. It sets a new record on the ODinW zero-shot benchmark with a mean $26.1$ AP. Code will be available at \\url{https://github.com/IDEA-Research/GroundingDINO}."

In this work, we propose a novel zero-shot framework based on prompt learning to detect rumors falling in different domains or presented in different languages. More specifically, we firstly represent rumor circulated on social media as diverse propagation threads, then design a hierarchical prompt encoding mechanism to learn language-agnostic contextual representations for both prompts and rumor data. To further enhance domain adaptation, we model the domain-invariant structural features from the propagation threads, to incorporate structural position representations of influential community response. In addition, a new virtual response augmentation method is used to improve model training.

Moreover, they neglected the rich information contained in external knowledge, e.g., image captions. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework for sarcasm detection by exploring both the atomic-level congruity based on multi-head cross attentions and the composition-level congruity based on graph neural networks, where a post with low congruity can be identified as sarcasm. In addition, we exploit the effect of various knowledge resources for sarcasm detection.

However, existing rumor detection methods are either limited to the strict relation of user responses or oversimplify the conversation structure. In this study, to substantially reinforces the interaction of user opinions while alleviating the negative impact imposed by irrelevant posts, we first represent the conversation thread as an undirected interaction graph. We then present a Claim-guided Hierarchical Graph Attention Network for rumor classification, which enhances the representation learning for responsive posts considering the entire social contexts and attends over the posts that can semantically infer the target claim. Extensive experiments on three Twitter datasets demonstrate that our rumor detection method achieves much better performance than state-of-the-art methods and exhibits a superior capacity for detecting rumors at early stages."

This restricted form of supervision limits their generality and usability since additional labeled data is needed to specify any other visual concept. Learning directly from raw text about images is a promising alternative which leverages a much broader source of supervision. We demonstrate that the simple pre-training task of predicting which caption goes with which image is an efficient and scalable way to learn SOTA image representations from scratch on a dataset of 400 million (image, text) pairs collected from the internet. After pre-training, natural language is used to reference learned visual concepts (or describe new ones) enabling zero-shot transfer of the model to downstream tasks. We study the performance of this approach by benchmarking on over 30 different existing computer vision datasets, spanning tasks such as OCR, action recognition in videos, geo-localization, and many types of fine-grained object classification. The model transfers non-trivially to most tasks and is often competitive with a fully supervised baseline without the need for any dataset specific training. For instance, we match the accuracy of the original ResNet-50 on ImageNet zero-shot without needing to use any of the 1.28 million training examples it was trained on. We release our code and pre-trained model weights at https://github.com/OpenAI/CLIP."

Despite its usefulness, sarcasm detection remains a challenging task, due to a lack of any vocal intonation or facial gestures in textual data. To date, most of the approaches to addressing the problem have relied on hand-crafted affect features, or pre-trained models of non-contextual word embeddings, such as Word2vec. However, these models inherit limitations that render them inadequate for the task of sarcasm detection. In this paper, we propose two novel deep neural network models for sarcasm detection, namely ACE 1 and ACE 2. Given as input a text passage, the models predict whether it is sarcastic (or not). Our models extend the architecture of BERT by incorporating both affective and contextual features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to directly alter BERT’s architecture and train it from scratch to build a sarcasm classifier. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that the proposed models outperform state-of-the-art models for sarcasm detection with significant margins."

These platforms allow users to create multi-modal messages, including texts, images, and videos. Existing multi-modal sarcasm detection methods either simply concatenate the features from multi modalities or fuse the multi modalities information in a designed manner. However, they ignore the incongruity character in sarcastic utterance, which is often manifested between modalities or within modalities. Inspired by this, we propose a BERT architecture-based model, which concentrates on both intra and inter-modality incongruity for multi-modal sarcasm detection. To be specific, we are inspired by the idea of self-attention mechanism and design inter-modality attention to capturing inter-modality incongruity. In addition, the co-attention mechanism is applied to model the contradiction within the text. The incongruity information is then used for prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public multi-modal sarcasm detection dataset."

We hope that this work will help promote a more complete evaluation protocol for text summarization as well as advance research in developing evaluation metrics that better correlate with human judgments."

With the rapid growth of social media, multimodal sarcastic tweets are widely posted on various social platforms. In multimodal context, sarcasm is no longer a pure linguistic phenomenon, and due to the nature of social media short text, the opposite is more often manifested via cross-modality expressions. Thus traditional text-based methods are insufficient to detect multimodal sarcasm. To reason with multimodal sarcastic tweets, in this paper, we propose a novel method for modeling cross-modality contrast in the associated context. Our method models both cross-modality contrast and semantic association by constructing the Decomposition and Relation Network (namely D&R Net). The decomposition network represents the commonality and discrepancy between image and text, and the relation network models the semantic association in cross-modality context. Experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in multimodal sarcasm detection."

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general."

We treat text features, image features and image attributes as three modalities and propose a multi-modal hierarchical fusion model to address this task.

Features of three modalities are then reconstructed and fused into one feature vector for prediction. We create a multi-modal sarcasm detection dataset based on Twitter.

Failure to detect sarcastic expressions in natural language processing tasks, such as opinion mining and sentiment analysis, leads to poor model performance. Traditional approaches rely heavily on discrete handcrafted features and will incur enormous human costs. It was not until recent that scholars began to employ neural networks to address these limitations and have achieved new state-of-the-art performance. In this work, we propose a novel self-matching network to capture sentence ”incongruity” information by exploring word-to-word interactions. In particular, we calculate the joint information in each word-to-word pair in the input sentence to build a self-matching attention vector, based on which we attend the sentence and build its representation vector. Such a network allows sentence to match within itself word by word and cater to the words of conflict sentiments. In addition, we incorporate a bi-directional LSTM network into our proposed network to retain compositional information. We concatenate incongruity information and compositional information through a Low-rank Bilinear Pooling method to control for potential information redundancy without losing discriminative power. Experiment results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms extant baselines on standard evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1 score and accuracy."

The optimal objective for a metric is the metric itself. In the case of axis-aligned 2D bounding boxes, it can be shown that IoU can be directly used as a regression loss. However, IoU has a plateau making it infeasible to optimize in the case of non-overlapping bounding boxes. In this paper, we address the this weakness by introducing a generalized version of IoU as both a new loss and a new metric. By incorporating this generalized IoU ( GIoU) as a loss into the state-of-the art object detection frameworks, we show a consistent improvement on their performance using both the standard, IoU based, and new, GIoU based, performance measures on popular object detection benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC and MS COCO."

The detection of sarcasm in social media platforms has been applied in the past mainly to textual utterances where lexical indicators (such as interjections and intensifiers), linguistic markers, and contextual information (such as user profiles, or past conversations) were used to detect the sarcastic tone. However, modern social media platforms allow to create multimodal messages where audiovisual content is integrated with the text, making the analysis of a mode in isolation partial. In our work, we first study the relationship between the textual and visual aspects in multimodal posts from three major social media platforms, i.e., Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter, and we run a crowdsourcing task to quantify the extent to which images are perceived as necessary by human annotators. Moreover, we propose two different computational frameworks to detect sarcasm that integrate the textual and visual modalities. The first approach exploits visual semantics trained on an external dataset, and concatenates the semantics features with state-of-the-art textual features. The second method adapts a visual neural network initialized with parameters trained on ImageNet to multimodal sarcastic posts. Results show the positive effect of combining modalities for the detection of sarcasm across platforms and methods."

                "abstract": "A common form of sarcasm on Twitter consists of a positive sentiment contrasted with a negative situation. For example, many sarcastic tweets include a positive sentiment, such as “love” or “enjoy”, followed by an expression that describes an undesirable activity or state (e.g., “taking exams” or “being ignored”). We have developed a sarcasm recognizer to identify this type of sarcasm in tweets. We present a novel bootstrapping algorithm that automatically learns lists of positive sentiment phrases and negative situation phrases from sarcastic tweets. We show that identifying contrasting contexts using the phrases learned through bootstrapping yields improved recall for sarcasm recognition."

The inherently ambiguous nature of sarcasm sometimes makes it hard even for humans to decide whether an utterance is sarcastic or not. Recognition of sarcasm can benefit many sentiment analysis NLP applications, such as review summarization, dialogue systems and review ranking systems. \n \nIn this paper we experiment with semi-supervised sarcasm identification on two very different data sets: a collection of 5.9 million tweets collected from Twitter, and a collection of 66000 product reviews from Amazon. Using the Mechanical Turk we created a gold standard sample in which each sentence was tagged by 3 annotators, obtaining F-scores of 0.78 on the product reviews dataset and 0.83 on the Twitter dataset. We discuss the differences between the datasets and how the algorithm uses them (e.g., for the Amazon dataset the algorithm makes use of structured information). We also discuss the utility of Twitter #sarcasm hashtags for the task."

                "abstract": "This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/Swin-Transformer."

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement)."

                "\nSarcasm, a prevalent form of figurative language, is often used in daily communication to convey irony, typically implying the opposite of its literal meaning~\\citep{joshi2017automatic}. As an important component in deciphering sarcasm, automated Sarcasm Target Identification (STI) is crucial for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in customer service~\\citep{davidov2010semi}, opinion mining~\\citep{riloff2013sarcasm}, and online harassment detection~\\citep{yin2009detection}. Although prior research on STI has primarily centered on textual content~\\citep{joshi2018sarcasm, parameswaran2019detecting}, the surge in multimodal user-generated content has propelled the field of multimodal sarcasm target identification to the forefront of research~\\citep{wang2022multimodal}, making it a significant area of study in both NLP applications and multimedia computing. \n\nThe MSTI task is to extract the entities being ridiculed (i.e., sarcasm targets) from both the text and image in multimodal sarcastic content. Previous work~\\citep{devlin2019bert, bochkovskiy2020yolov4} attempted to straightforwardly integrate a BERT-based textual encoder and a CNN-based visual encoder for just modeling the sarcasm text and image, respectively. The state-of-the-art approach~\\citep{wang2022multimodal} treats MSTI merely as an end-to-end task, primarily focusing on the superficial signals evident in the surface-level text and image. However, a more thorough investigation and understanding of the underlying meanings are essential, particularly in cases where the correlation between image and text is not immediately apparent in multimodal sarcasm~\\citep{tian2023dynamic}.\n{\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\subfigure[]{\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\\linewidth}\n\\centering\n\\scalebox{0.75}{\\includegraphics[width=5cm]{intro_1.pdf}}\n\\label{fig:sarcasm_1}\n\\end{minipage}%\n}%\n\\subfigure[]{\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\\linewidth}\n\\centering\n\\scalebox{0.75}{\\includegraphics[width=5cm]{intro_2.pdf}}\n\\label{fig:sarcasm_2}\n\\end{minipage}%\n}%\n\\centering\n\\caption{Examples of multimodal sarcasm on \\textbf{Twitter}: (\\textbf{a}) ``\\textit{never seen a \\#\\textcolor{red}{dlr train driver} before. looks like a tough job \\#london}''; (\\textbf{b}) ``\\textit{thank god for no product placement in \\#ukraine \\#eurovision}''. Boxes in \\textcolor{green(ncs)}{green} and words in \\textcolor{red}{red} denote the visual and textual targets.}\n\\label{fig:motivation}\n\\end{figure}}\n\nComprehending and analyzing multimodal sarcasm poses a considerable challenge, because its implicit meaning demands an in-depth understanding and reasoning of commonsense knowledge. For example, as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:sarcasm_1}, a human checker needs reasonable thoughts between visual and textual sarcasm targets, to understand that the man's leisurely sitting posture in front of the control panel creates a sarcastic contrast between the idea of the train driver's job being difficult and the actual scene. Moreover, as the example shows in Figure~\\ref{fig:sarcasm_2}, the sarcasm target sometimes does not appear explicitly in the text, which makes it more challenging for conventional models to cognize that the example implies that the presence of the Pepsi bottle is a form of product placement, which is often seen as a marketing tactic. We contend the challenge lies in delivering rich multimodal knowledge that consistently assists in deciphering the concealed semantics within the multimodal nature of sarcasm.\n \nIn this paper, we adhere to the following two key principles in the knowledge-augmented design of our approach: 1) LMM Reasoning: To grasp the implicit meanings intrinsic in sarcasm, we resort to the extensive prior knowledge embedded within Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)~\\citep{liu2023visual, bai2023qwen}. This design philosophy enables complex reasoning, thereby enhancing both the MSTI accuracy and explainability; 2) MSD Pre-training: Previous literature~\\citep{joshi2018sarcasm} indicates that MSTI inherently appraises the presence of sarcasm targeting each entity within sarcastic content. Similar to Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD)~\\citep{qin2023mmsd2}, which involves determining the sarcasm in multi-modalities at a holistic content level, MSTI actually engages in finer-grained sarcasm detection at the localized entity level. Considering such a close correlation between MSD and MSTI, it is assumed that insights from the coarser-grained MSD are instrumental in discerning sarcasm targets in the finer-grained MSTI. Thus we devise a cohesive framework to operate on the coarse-to-fine training paradigm, aimed at pinpointing nuanced visual and textual targets of multimodal sarcasm for MSTI by benefitting from LMM reasoning and MSD pre-training.\n\nTo these ends, we propose a novel framework with a \\textbf{\\underline{Co}}arse-to-\\textbf{\\underline{fi}}ne \\textbf{\\underline{Para}}digm, \\textbf{CofiPara}, by leveraging the divergent knowledge extracted from LMMs for multimodal sarcasm target identification. Specifically, we integrate text and image modalities within the coarse-to-fine training paradigm, which consists of two phases: 1) Coarser-grained Sarcasm Detection: Initially, we engage LMMs in critical thinking to generate rationales from both sarcastic and non-sarcastic perspectives. Utilizing these generated sarcasm rationales, we pre-train a smaller model to act as a rationale referee to implicitly extract sarcasm-indicative signals in the competing rationales for sarcasm prediction. This process aligns multimodal features between the sarcasm content and its underlying rationales, alleviating the negative impact of inevitable noise from LMMs through competing rationales; 2) Finer-grained Target Identification: Subsequently, we further fine-tune the smaller model pre-trained in the previous stage for multimodal sarcasm target identification. This phase enhances our model with the multimodal reasoning knowledge, acquired in the pre-training stage and the rationale in sarcastic perspective, to reveal the meanings concealed within the comprehensive multimodal information of sarcasm samples. In this manner, our CofiPara framework could be naturally output as the explanatory basis for deciphering multimodal sarcasm. Extensive experiments conducted on two public sarcasm datasets reveal that our approach far outperforms previous state-of-the-art MSTI methods, and achieves competitive results compared with MSD baselines. The experimental analysis further underscores the enhanced ability to provide superior explainability in the realm of multimodal sarcasm. Our contributions are summarized as follows in three folds:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study multimodal sarcasm from a fresh perspective on explainability in both multimodal targets and natural texts, by exploiting advanced large multimodal models.\n}\n    \\item We propose a universal MSTI framework with the novel coarse-to-fine paradigm that incorporates the multimodal sarcasm target identification and the textual explanation for deciphering the multimodal sarcasm, which enhances sarcasm explainability in conjunction with effective multimodal sarcasm detection.\n    \\item Extensive experiments confirm that our framework could yield superior performance on multimodal sarcasm target identification, and further provide informative explanations for a better understanding of multimodal sarcasm.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n"

                "\\textbf{MSD.}\nSarcasm detection involves discerning sentiment incongruity within a context, traditionally emphasizing text modality~\\citep{xiong2019sarcasm, babanejad2020affective}. Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD), enhanced by image integration, has garnered growing research interest~\\citep{schifanella2016detecting}. \\citet{cai2019multi} introduced a comprehensive MSD dataset, incorporating text, image, and image attributes, alongside a hierarchical fusion model. Subsequently, a range of studies has utilized attention mechanisms to subtly blend features from different modalities~\\citep{xu2020reasoning, pan2020modeling, tian2023dynamic}. Another line of recent advancements has seen the introduction of graph-based methods for sarcasm detection~\\citep{liang2021multi, liang2022multi, liu2022towards}, which excel in identifying key indicators across modalities. \\citet{qin2023mmsd2} revealed spurious cues in the previous MSD dataset~\\citep{cai2019multi} and provided an alternative refined dataset version. Existing solutions, however, only focused on performing multimodal sarcasm classification (i.e., predicting if a sample is sarcastic) with limited explanations for its prediction. In this paper, we delve into the explainability of multimodal sarcasm from both multimodal targets and textual rationales, aiming to decipher multimodal sarcasm using more intuitive forms and assisting users in gaining a better understanding.\n\n\\textbf{MSTI.}\nRecent advancements in sarcasm analysis have seen a significant focus on Sarcasm Target Identification (STI), with notable contributions from researchers. STI aims to pinpoint the subject of mockery in sarcastic texts. \\citet{joshi2018sarcasm} introduced the concept of STI and discussed its application in the 2019 ALTA shared task~\\citep{molla2019overview}, highlighting evaluation metrics like Exact Match accuracy and F1 score. \\citet{patro2019deep} later developed a deep learning model enhanced with socio-linguistic features for target identification, while \\citet{parameswaran2019detecting} utilized a combination of classifiers, \nfollowed by a rule-based method for extracting textual sarcasm targets. Moreover, \\citet{wang2022multimodal} pioneered STI in multimodal contexts by integrating sequence labeling with object detection in an end-to-end manner, but only capturing the superficial signals of different modalities in sarcasm. In this work, we regard the MSD task as the predecessor pre-training phase of MSTI, to better derive the prior reasoning knowledge absorbed in the coarser-grained auxiliary task MSD to the finer-grained goal task MSTI. \n\n\\textbf{LLMs and LMMs.}\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional versatility across various tasks. Significant advancements by leading tech companies have resulted in highly proficient, though often proprietary, LLMs~\\citep{brown2020language, OpenAI2023GPT4TR, chowdhery2022palm, team2023gemini}. Meanwhile, the NLP community has seen the rise of open-source LLMs, with publicly shared model weights~\\citep{black2022gpt, zeng2022glm, touvron2023llama, touvron2023llama2, wizardlm, wizardcoder}. More recently, LLMs have also been developed to adapt in processing both textual and visual data, marking a significant advancement. Recent research has focused on constructing versatile multimodal datasets~\\citep{yang2023dawn} from platforms like GPT-4 and GPT-4V~\\citep{OpenAI2023GPT4TR}, fine-tuning open-source LMMs such as LLaVA~\\citep{liu2023visual}, Qwen-VL~\\citep{bai2023qwen}, and other innovative projects~\\citep{Dai2023InstructBLIPTG, wang2023cogvlm}. These LMMs have shown excellent emergent abilities in multimodal tasks. In this work, we foster divergent thinking in LMMs by employing potential sarcasm labels as prompts, which promotes a coarse-to-fine strategy for fine-tuning smaller Language Models (LMs). Combined with MSTI, this design philosophy enhances the sarcasm understanding within the universal framework, steering it towards greater sarcasm explainability.\n\n"

The rationales from LLMs usually express perspectives grounded with commonsense or related to certain social scenarios~\\citep{huang2023chatgpt, lin2024explainable}, which can be used as extensive prior knowledge for smaller downstream models to facilitate decision-making.\nAlthough LLMs have shown emergent abilities in reasoning and interpreting, they still suffer from preconception bias and may generate uncredible content or even make false assertions~\\citep{hu2023bad, lin2023beneath}. Therefore, the downstream decision-maker model would have to be robust enough to alleviate the negative impact imposed by the input noisy LLM-generated rationales. In pursuit of this, we resort to the inspiration of divergent multimodal thinking with vision LLMs, i.e., LMMs, fostering our model to explore a more reliable reasoning pathway from the conflicting and noisy insights provided by LMMs. \n\nGiven an input ${M} = \\{I,T\\}$, we prompt LMMs to generate a pair of competing rationales based on the text $T$, the image $I$, and the potential sarcasm labels ${*} \\in \\{\\texttt{sarcastic}, \\texttt{non-sarcastic}\\}$, by using a prompt template $p$ we curated in advance. To exploit LMMs' divergent reasoning ability, we construct each sample with different potential sarcasm labels, respectively. Specifically, we design the prompt template $p$ as follows:\n\n\\textit{``Given a tweet that consists of a text and an image, please give me a rationale of why the tweet is $\\{*\\}$. \\\\\ntweet text: $\\{T\\}$ \\\\\ntweet image: $\\{I\\}$''\n}\n\nNote that the potential labels $*$ are just used to formalize two opposite standpoints for multimodal reasoning regardless of the ground-truth label. Then we can derive the competing rationales $r_{pos}$ or $r_{neg}$ from LMMs to support the \\texttt{sarcastic} or \\texttt{non-sarcastic} positions.\nBy introducing adversarial labels, we encourage LMMs to adopt diverse perspectives, thereby providing a range of background knowledge enriched with deliberate noise. Because the rationale for the false class ideally contains more useless information than the other one for the ground truth. The contextual subtleties of sarcasm that are pivotal to rival candidate sarcasm categories, can be thus more effectively highlighted and contrasted. This allows the rest of the model to achieve the logical reasoning of the true sarcastic intent by considering it from diverse perspectives, while moderating vulnerability to the potential noise in the LMM-generated rationales.\n\n\\subsection{Coarser-Grained Pre-Training}\\label{MSD}\n\nGiven the close correlation between the coarser-grained multimodal sarcasm detection with the finer-grained multimodal sarcasm target identification, we advocate for initial pre-training in multimodal sarcasm detection, allowing the model to grasp the essence of sarcasm preliminarily. This foundational understanding could set the stage for a more nuanced and detailed identification of sarcasm targets in subsequent fine-tuning.\n\\noindent\\textbf{Encoding and Fusion.} \nFor an input sample ${M} = \\{I,\\hat{T}\\}$ packed with the generated competing rationales, where $\\hat{T} = \\{T, r_{pos}, r_{neg}\\}$ is the input text, we first extract textual and visual features as:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\nH_T =\\mathsf{E}_T(\\hat{T}), \n~~\nI_E =\\mathsf{E}_I(I),\n\\end{equation}}\nwhere $H_{T} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$ is the token embedding output by the text encoder $\\mathsf{E}_T(\\cdot)$ implemented by Transformer Encoder~\\citep{raffel2020exploring}, $m$ is the input token length and $d$ is the dimension of hidden states. $\\mathsf{E}_I(\\cdot)$ denotes the image encoder based on Vision Transformer~\\citep{liu2021swin}, used to fetch the patch-level features of the image with $n$ patches, which are projected into the visual features $I_E \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Since both the text and image encoders are designed as Transformer-based, the embeddings shaped by the isomorphic encoding structure can enhance consecutive multimodal fusion during encoding~\\citep{liu2023grounding}.\nThen, to align the semantics in the text and image, we adopt a bi-directional attention module based on the cross-attention mechanism. Taking the text-to-image cross-attention ${CrossAttn}(H_T,I_E)$ as an example, we define the query, key and value as $\\{Q_{{T}},  K_{{I}}, V_{{I}}\\} = \\{H_T W_Q, I_E W_K, I_E W_V\\}$, where $\\{W_{Q}, W_{K}, W_{V}\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d_k}$ are trainable weights. Then the calculation is as follows:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{aligned}\nH_{T}^0  & =\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q_T K_I^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) V_I,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\label{c_attn}\n\\end{equation}}\nWith Equation~\\ref{c_attn}, similarly, we can calculate the image-to-text cross-attention. Combing the two cross-attention modules together, we fuse the multimodal features during encoding as follows:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{aligned}\nH_{T}^0 &= {CrossAttn}(H_T, I_E), \\\\\nI_B &= {CrossAttn}(I_E,H_T),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}} where $H_{T}^0, I_B$ are the attended textual and visual features, respectively. \nTo optimize the information integration of multimodal sarcasm with competing rationales, we further develop a query selection mechanism to prioritize image region features that exhibit higher correlations with the input text. This yields:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\arg \\max_n \\left(\\max_m \\left(I_B {H_{T}^0}^{\\top} \\right)\\right),\n\\end{equation}}\nwith which we obtain the index of the topmost relevant local visual features, queried by the textual features ${H_{T}^0}$ from the global visual features $I_B$. We name the selected local visual features as $I_Q$.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Cross-Modality Text Decoding.}  Based on the attended textual features $H_{T}^0$ and query-selected local visual features $I_Q$, we then devise a multimodal decoding strategy with textual outputs to infer sarcasm for MSD. Specifically, during decoding, we only exploit a text-to-image cross-attention module to attain the textual features attended with the visual ones:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n{H_T^i}_{attn} &= {CrossAttn}(H_{T}^i, I_Q),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}}\nwhere $H_T^i$ is the textual feature input of the $i^{th}$ LM decoder layer, and ${H_T^i}_{attn}$ is the attended textual feature output of the cross-attention ${CrossAttn}$. Then by adding the attended features ${H_T^i}_{attn}$ to the output of the $i^{th}$ LM decoder $LM_{dec}^i$, the fused intermediate features $H_T^{i+1}$ fed into the next LM decoder layer are:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_T^{i+1} & = LM_{dec}^i(H_T^i) + {H_T^i}_{attn}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}}\nAfter $L$ layers of cross-modality LM decoder, we have the final textual representations $H_T^L$, further decoded as the text output to clearly express whether the sample is sarcastic. Finally, we train the model $f$ by minimizing the following loss:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{L}_{text} = CE(f(I,\\hat{T}),y),\n\\label{eq6}\n\\end{equation}}\nwhere $CE(\\cdot)$ denotes the cross-entropy loss between the generated label token and ground truth label $y$ for MSD. During the coarser-grained pre-training, the model is trained to distill the essence and discard irrelevant elements from the divergent thinking of LMMs about sarcasm. Such a process could fortify our model's resilience in the subsequent fine-tuning stage for MSTI, ensuring robustness against the potential inaccuracies stemming from LMMs, leading to a more independent and refined thought of the LMM-generated rationales.\n\\subsection{Finer-Grained Fine-Tuning} \n\\label{MSTI}\nAfter the coarser-grained pre-training stage, our model could be resilient against the potential variation and bias in LMMs through the competing rationales, to first comprehend what constitutes sarcasm. As the goal of our approach is to identify both the textual and visual sarcasm targets for further deciphering sarcasm, we conduct the finer-grained fine-tuning stage for MSTI, which shares the same model architecture, parameters of the multimodal encoding and text decoding procedures as $\\S$\\ref{MSD} but differs in the text decoding output and an additional image decoding procedure.\n\nDifferent from the pre-training stage in $\\S$\\ref{MSD}, the sample $M$ in MSTI is set as \\textit{sarcastic} prior due to the nature of this specific task~\\citep{wang2022multimodal}.\nThus the input text for a given \\textit{sarcastic} sample $M$ is formed as $\\hat{T} = \\{T, r_{pos}\\}$ in this stage, where we only provide the text $T$ and the LMM-generated rationale $r_{pos}$ that explains why $M$ is sarcastic. For the cross-modality text decoding, we generate the predicted textual sarcasm targets that are entities in the text $T$. Then the textual target loss $\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{text}$ can be computed akin to that outlined in Equation~\\ref{eq6}.   \n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Cross-Modality Image Decoding.} \nFor visual object detection, we use a cross-modality image decoder to discern the visual sarcasm target, where the textual features $H_T^0$ and the global visual features $I_B$ are used to attend to the local visual features $I_Q$ in each Transformer decoder layer:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I_Q^{j^{\\prime}}={SelfAttn}\\left(I_Q^j\\right), \\\\\n& I_Q^{j^{\\prime \\prime}}={CrossAttn}\\left(I_Q^{j^{\\prime}}, I_B\\right), \\\\\n& I_Q^{j+1}={CrossAttn}\\left(I_Q^{j^{\\prime \\prime}}, H_T^0\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}}\nwhere ${SelfAttn}(\\cdot)$ denotes self-attention, and $I_Q^j$ is the input of the $j^{th}$ Transformer decoder layer. After $K$ layers of the image decoder, we have the final visual features $I_Q^K$. Afterwards, we decode $I_Q^K$ as the image output consisting of a bounding box output and its confidence score. Following previous object detection work~\\citep{zhang2022dino}, we use the L1 loss $\\mathcal{L}_{l1}$ and the GIOU~\\citep{rezatofighi2019generalized} loss $\\mathcal{L}_{giou}$ for bounding box regressions, and the cross-entropy classification loss $\\mathcal{L}_{cls}$ for confidence scores as the joint optimization objective:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{L}_{img} = \\alpha  \\mathcal{L}_{l1} + \\beta  \\mathcal{L}_{giou} +\\gamma  \\mathcal{L}_{cls},\n\\label{eq_imgloss}\n\\end{equation}}\nwhere $\\alpha, \\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are the hyper-parameters to scale the losses, $\\mathcal{L}_{img}$ is the visual target loss. Finally, the overall training loss $\\mathcal{L}$ for this stage is:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{img} + \\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{text}.\n\\end{equation}}\n\n\\paragraph{Model Training.}\nWe implement model training following a coarse-to-fine paradigm: 1) Pre-training on the coarser-grained MSD task by minimizing $\\mathcal{L}_{text}$, and 2) Fine-tuning on the finer-grained MSTI task by minimizing $\\mathcal{L}$, where the auxiliary task MSD is the predecessor training phase of the goal task MSTI. To this end, we unify the classification task for MSD and the sequence tagging task for textual target identification in MSTI into a text generation task. Note that for model testing on MSD, we use the model parameters obtained after the coarser-grained pre-training; in terms of the goal task MSTI, we directly input the test sarcastic sample into our finer-grained fine-tuned model to identify multimodal sarcasm targets. \n\n"

Specifically, MMSD2.0 is a correction version of the raw MMSD dataset~\\citep{cai2019multi}, by removing the spurious cues and fixing unreasonable annotation.\nIn the coarser-grained pre-training stage, we utilized the large-scale MMSD2.0 dataset to pre-train our model for multimodal sarcasm detection. Thus we introduce a refined version, i.e., MSTI2.0, to address the low-quality issue of the raw MSTI data by removing the visual target labels in images of only characters and converting them into the textual sarcasm target labels. Afterwards, MSTI2.0 is employed to fine-tune and evaluate the model in the finer-grained fine-tuning stage of our framework. \n\\begin{table}[] \\small\n\\centering\n\\resizebox{0.95\\linewidth}{!}{\\begin{tabular}{lcccc}\n\\toprule\n\\multicolumn{1}{c}{}       & \\multicolumn{1}{l}{Acc.} & P     & R     & F1    \\\\ \\hline\nAtt-BERT                   & 80.03                    & 76.28 & 77.82 & 77.04 \\\\\nCMGCN                      & 79.83                    & 75.82 & 78.01 & 76.90 \\\\\nHKE                      & 76.50                    & 73.48 & 71.07 & 72.25 \\\\\nDynRT                      & 72.06                    & 71.79 & 72.18 & 71.98 \\\\\nMulti-view CLIP           & 84.31                    & 79.66 & 85.34 & 82.40 \\\\ \\hline\nCofiPara-\\textsc{Msd}               & \\textbf{85.70}                    & \\textbf{85.96} & \\textbf{85.55} & \\textbf{85.89} \\\\\n\\toprule %\\hline\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{Multimodal sarcasm detection results.}\n\\label{msd_res}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Baselines.} We compare our model with the following multimodal baselines for multimodal sarcasm detection, which is the auxiliary task: \n1) \\textsf{Att-BERT}~\\citep{pan2020modeling}; 2) \\textsf{CMGCN}~\\citep{liang2022multi}; 3) \\textsf{HKE}~\\citep{liu2022towards}; 4) \\textsf{DynRT-Net}~\\citep{tian2023dynamic}; 5) \\textsf{Multi-view CLIP}~\\citep{qin2023mmsd2}.

From these results, we have the following observations: 1) Compared to graph-based methods such as CMGCN and HKE and routing-based DynRT, Att-BERT that relies on semantic understanding has better performance, indicating that this task requires models to capture deep semantic information rather than superficial attributes. 2) Multi-view CLIP shows an overall advantage in its ability to align textual and visual features, and the isomorphic structures of text and image encoder also contribute to its superiority. 3) Our proposed CofiPara-\\textsc{Msd} surpasses the leading baseline by 1.39\\% and 3.49\\% in accuracy and F1 score, additionally demonstrating a more balanced performance in terms of recall and precision, despite not primarily targeting the MSD task. The distinctive advantage of our model lies in the fact that while all the baselines solely focus on recognition, our model is equipped with rationales from divergent thinking with LMMs, which empowers our model to effectively uncover sarcastic content by adeptly leveraging the interplay between seemingly unrelated textual and visual elements within sarcasm.\n\\noindent\\textbf{Target Identification Performance.}\nTable \\ref{msti_res} shows the performance (\\%) of our method versus unimodal and multimodal baselines on the goal task MSTI. It can be observed that: 1) The unimodal methods, like text-modality models in the first group and image-modality models in the second group, fall short in simultaneously identifying both visual and textual sarcasm targets compared to the multimodal methods in the third group. 2) The textual target identification performance of visual grounding models (i.e., OWL-ViT and Grounding DINO), is hindered by the discrepancy between the MSTI task and their original pre-training objectives. Additionally, the lack of a consistent one-to-one correspondence between textual and visual targets in MSTI samples further contributes to their suboptimal performance. 3) Our method drastically excels in EM and AP50 compared to baselines, especially in visual target identification. We observe that CofiPara-\\textsc{Msti} improves textual target identification performance by 3.26\\% on average EM score compared to MSTI-VB, suggesting that our model is more precise in discerning sarcasm targets in the text modality of multimodal contents. On the other hand, our model exhibits a substantial superiority in visual target identification performance, especially on the AP50 metric, for an average improvement of 14.88\\% over the best visual performed baseline, indicating that our model can capture the correct visual targets within the image modality that contain sarcastic meanings, while baseline models perform poorly by simply identifying object rather than sarcasm targets, which further implies that our model displays a better understanding of multimodal sarcasm.\n\n\n\\subsection{Ablation Study of Target Identification}\n\n\\begin{table}[]\n\\resizebox{\\linewidth}{!}{\\begin{tabular}{lccccc}\n\\toprule\n                               & EM    & F1    & AP    & AP50  & AP75  \\\\ \\hline\nCofiPara-\\textsc{Msti}                  & 32.26 & 50.27 & 13.79 & 32.49 & 12.01 \\\\ \\hline\nw/o MSD               & 30.24 & 49.61 & 13.72 & 30.39 & 12.15 \\\\\nw/o LMM                 & 30.91 & 48.32 & 07.50 & 19.36 & 04.22 \\\\\nw/o MSD\\&LMM & 30.10 & 50.72 & 06.34 & 17.21 & 04.61 \\\\ \\toprule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{Ablation results on MSTI2.0 test set.}\n\\label{abla_msti_test}\n\\end{table}\n\nAs MSTI is our goal task, we conduct ablative studies on MSTI2.0 test data with the following variants: 1) \\textit{w/o MSD}: Simply train our model on the MSTI task without knowledge from pre-training on MSD.\n2) \\textit{w/o LMM}: Use model parameters initialized by pre-training on the MSD task, and fine-tune directly on the MSTI task without knowledge from LMMs. 3) \\textit{w/o MSD\\&LMM}: Train our model directly on the MSTI task without any knowledge of LMM reasoning and MSD pre-training.\n\nAs demonstrated in Table \\ref{abla_msti_test}, our model shows different degrees of performance degradation when MSD pre-training or LMM reasoning knowledge is ablated, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Specifically, visual target identification performances show significant degradations by 2.10\\% and 13.13\\% on AP50 for \\textit{w/o MSD} and \\textit{w/o LMM} settings, respectively. This indicates that both LMM reasoning and MSD pre-training are helpful in identifying sarcasm targets, and that external LMM knowledge has a relatively larger impact on visual performance. We also notice that, the \\textit{w/o LMM} setting has relatively mild improvement over \\textit{w/o MSD\\&LMM}. This can be attributed to the fact that although the MSD pre-training itself may not necessarily significantly enhance model performance on the MSTI task with a large margin, it could help our model learn to implicitly ignore useless expressions and extract informative signals in the rationales from LMMs, highlighting its synergistic complementary with the LMM knowledge.\n\n\\subsection{Case Study of Explainability}\n\\label{case_study_sec}\n\nTo better understand the mechanism of how LMM-generated rationales facilitate sarcasm target identification, we conduct a case study on the correctly predicted samples for better sarcasm explainability, as shown in Figure \\ref{case_study}, where visual sarcasm targets are annotated by green rectangles and textual sarcasm targets are highlighted in red italics.\n\nIn these examples, we observe that: 1) rationales generated by LMM help promote the connections between two modalities. As shown in Figure \\ref{case_study}(a), we notice that in the generated rationale, the image is depicted as a photo of Narendra Modi, which is then linked to the man who makes a refusing gesture in the picture. By introducing the connection between the word ``narendramodi'' and the man in the image, the target can be more easily recognized by our model; 2) on the other hand, rationales can complement background messages that are not given in the original texts and images, including both common sense and political knowledge. For example, in Figure \\ref{case_study}(a), the rationale first recognizes the man as Prime Minister of India, and then offers a correction ``for the first time ever'' to the non-standard abbreviation of ``for d 1st time ever'', which is further explained as an expression of sarcastic tone towards Modi. Similarly, in Figure \\ref{case_study}(b), LMM interprets ``mlk'' as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the day to memorize dissenters who fought for civil rights, while the fact that police are arresting the dissenter in the image is in conflict with the context that expresses thanks to police, as well as the hashtag \\textit{\\#thinblueline}. The sarcasm target in the image is explained as the unjust political situation for people who fight for human rights, which is depicted in the image but outside the text. In this way, the rich but implicit correlations between the sarcasm text and image could be explained in visualized targets and readable snippets, which are also potentially valuable for aiding human checkers in verifying the sarcasm.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth, scale=1.00]{casestudy.pdf}\n    \\caption{Examples of correctly identified samples.} \n    \\label{case_study}\n\\end{figure}\n\n"

Current methods for Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification (MSTI) primarily focus on superficial indicators in an end-to-end manner, overlooking the nuanced understanding of multimodal sarcasm conveyed through both text and image. This oversight limits the effectiveness of these methods in deciphering the complex nature of sarcasm. The paper addresses this gap by proposing a versatile MSTI framework with a coarse-to-fine paradigm, augmenting sarcasm explainability with reasoning and pre-training knowledge. The framework leverages the powerful capacity of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) for multimodal reasoning, first engaging LMMs to generate competing rationales for coarser-grained pre-training of a small language model on multimodal sarcasm detection. Subsequently, the model is fine-tuned for finer-grained sarcasm target identification. This approach aims to adeptly unveil the intricate targets within multimodal sarcasm and mitigate the negative impact posed by potential noise inherently in LMMs. The significance of this research lies in its ability to enhance the explainability of sarcasm and improve the accuracy of MSTI methods.\",\n  \"main_idea\": \"The paper presents CofiPara, a novel framework for Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification (MSTI) that employs a coarse-to-fine paradigm.

For example, many sarcastic tweets include a positive sentiment, such as “love” or “enjoy”, followed by an expression that describes an undesirable activity or state (e.g., “taking exams” or “being ignored”). We have developed a sarcasm recognizer to identify this type of sarcasm in tweets. We present a novel bootstrapping algorithm that automatically learns lists of positive sentiment phrases and negative situation phrases from sarcastic tweets. We show that identifying contrasting contexts using the phrases learned through bootstrapping yields improved recall for sarcasm recognition.\n@inproceedings{riloff2013sarcasm,\n  title={Sarcasm as contrast between a positive sentiment and negative situation},\n  author={Riloff, Ellen and Qadir, Ashequl and Surve, Prafulla and De Silva, Lalindra and Gilbert, Nathan and Huang, Ruihong},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2013 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing},\n  pages={704--714},\n  year={2013}\n}\n\nAbstract: Sarcasm is a sophisticated linguistic phenomenon to express the opposite of what one really means. With the rapid growth of social media, multimodal sarcastic tweets are widely posted on various social platforms. In multimodal context, sarcasm is no longer a pure linguistic phenomenon, and due to the nature of social media short text, the opposite is more often manifested via cross-modality expressions. Thus traditional text-based methods are insufficient to detect multimodal sarcasm. To reason with multimodal sarcastic tweets, in this paper, we propose a novel method for modeling cross-modality contrast in the associated context. Our method models both cross-modality contrast and semantic association by constructing the Decomposition and Relation Network (namely D&R Net). The decomposition network represents the commonality and discrepancy between image and text, and the relation network models the semantic association in cross-modality context. Experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in multimodal sarcasm detection.\n@inproceedings{xu2020reasoning,\n  title={Reasoning with multimodal sarcastic tweets via modeling cross-modality contrast and semantic association},\n  author={Xu, Nan and Zeng, Zhixiong and Mao, Wenji},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 58th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics},\n  pages={3777--3786},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\nAbstract: Sarcasm is a pervasive phenomenon in today’s social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit. These platforms allow users to create multi-modal messages, including texts, images, and videos. Existing multi-modal sarcasm detection methods either simply concatenate the features from multi modalities or fuse the multi modalities information in a designed manner. However, they ignore the incongruity character in sarcastic utterance, which is often manifested between modalities or within modalities. Inspired by this, we propose a BERT architecture-based model, which concentrates on both intra and inter-modality incongruity for multi-modal sarcasm detection. To be specific, we are inspired by the idea of self-attention mechanism and design inter-modality attention to capturing inter-modality incongruity. In addition, the co-attention mechanism is applied to model the contradiction within the text. The incongruity information is then used for prediction. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on a public multi-modal sarcasm detection dataset.\n@inproceedings{pan2020modeling,\n  title={Modeling intra and inter-modality incongruity for multi-modal sarcasm detection},\n  author={Pan, Hongliang and Lin, Zheng and Fu, Peng and Qi, Yatao and Wang, Weiping},\n  booktitle={Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2020},\n  pages={1383--1392},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\nAbstract: Sarcasm is a peculiar form of sentiment expression, where the surface sentiment differs from the implied sentiment. The detection of sarcasm in social media platforms has been applied in the past mainly to textual utterances where lexical indicators (such as interjections and intensifiers), linguistic markers, and contextual information (such as user profiles, or past conversations) were used to detect the sarcastic tone. However, modern social media platforms allow to create multimodal messages where audiovisual content is integrated with the text, making the analysis of a mode in isolation partial. In our work, we first study the relationship between the textual and visual aspects in multimodal posts from three major social media platforms, i.e., Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter, and we run a crowdsourcing task to quantify the extent to which images are perceived as necessary by human annotators. Moreover, we propose two different computational frameworks to detect sarcasm that integrate the textual and visual modalities. The first approach exploits visual semantics trained on an external dataset, and concatenates the semantics features with state-of-the-art textual features. The second method adapts a visual neural network initialized with parameters trained on ImageNet to multimodal sarcastic posts. Results show the positive effect of combining modalities for the detection of sarcasm across platforms and methods.\n@inproceedings{schifanella2016detecting,\n  title={Detecting sarcasm in multimodal social platforms},\n  author={Schifanella, Rossano and De Juan, Paloma and Tetreault, Joel and Cao, Liangliang},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 24th ACM international conference on Multimedia},\n  pages={1136--1145},\n  year={2016}\n}\n\nAbstract: Sarcasm is a subtle form of language in which people express the opposite of what is implied. Previous works of sarcasm detection focused on texts. However, more and more social media platforms like Twitter allow users to create multi-modal messages, including texts, images, and videos. It is insufficient to detect sarcasm from multi-model messages based only on texts. In this paper, we focus on multi-modal sarcasm detection for tweets consisting of texts and images in Twitter. We treat text features, image features and image attributes as three modalities and propose a multi-modal hierarchical fusion model to address this task. Our model first extracts image features and attribute features, and then leverages attribute features and bidirectional LSTM network to extract text features. Features of three modalities are then reconstructed and fused into one feature vector for prediction. We create a multi-modal sarcasm detection dataset based on Twitter. Evaluation results on the dataset demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed model and the usefulness of the three modalities.\n@inproceedings{cai2019multi,\n  title={Multi-modal sarcasm detection in twitter with hierarchical fusion model},\n  author={Cai, Yitao and Cai, Huiyu and Wan, Xiaojun},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 57th annual meeting of the association for computational linguistics},\n  pages={2506--2515},\n  year={2019}\n}\n\nAbstract: Sarcasm is a peculiar form and sophisticated linguistic act to express the incongruity of someone's implied sentiment expression, which is a pervasive phenomenon in social media platforms. Compared with sarcasm detection purely on texts, multi-modal sarcasm detection is more adapted to the rapidly growing social media platforms, where people are interested in creating multi-modal messages. When focusing on the multi-modal sarcasm detection for tweets consisting of texts and images on Twitter, the significant clue of improving the performance of multi-modal sarcasm detection evolves into how to determine the incongruity relations between texts and images. In this paper, we investigate multi-modal sarcasm detection from a novel perspective, so as to determine the sentiment inconsistencies within a certain modality and across different modalities by constructing heterogeneous in-modal and cross-modal graphs (InCrossMGs) for each multi-modal example. Based on it, we explore an interactive graph convolution network (GCN) structure to jointly and interactively learn the incongruity relations of in-modal and cross-modal graphs for determining the significant clues in sarcasm detection.

Due to its sophisticated nature, it is usually difficult to be detected from the text itself. As a result, multi-modal sarcasm detection has received more and more attention in both academia and industries. However, most existing techniques only modeled the atomic-level inconsistencies between the text input and its accompanying image, ignoring more complex compositions for both modalities. Moreover, they neglected the rich information contained in external knowledge, e.g., image captions. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical framework for sarcasm detection by exploring both the atomic-level congruity based on multi-head cross attentions and the composition-level congruity based on graph neural networks, where a post with low congruity can be identified as sarcasm. In addition, we exploit the effect of various knowledge resources for sarcasm detection.

Most existing studies regard the incongruity between image and text as the indicative clue in identifying multimodal sarcasm. To capture cross-modal incongruity, previous methods rely on fixed architectures in network design, which restricts the model from dynamically adjusting to diverse image-text pairs. Inspired by routing-based dynamic network, we model the dynamic mechanism in multimodal sarcasm detection and propose the Dynamic Routing Transformer Network (DynRT-Net). Our method utilizes dynamic paths to activate different routing transformer modules with hierarchical co-attention adapting to cross-modal incongruity. Experimental results on a public dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Sarcasm Target Identification (STI) deserves further study to understand sarcasm in depth. However, text lacking context or missing sarcasm target makes target identification very difficult. In this paper, we introduce multimodality to STI and present Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification (MSTI) task. We propose a novel multi-scale cross-modality model that can simultaneously perform textual target labeling and visual target detection. In the model, we extract multi-scale visual features to enrich spatial information for different sized visual sarcasm targets. We design a set of convolution networks to unify multi-scale visual features with textual features for cross-modal attention learning, and correspondingly a set of transposed convolution networks to restore multi-scale visual information. The results show that visual clues can improve the performance of TSTI by a large margin, and VSTI achieves good accuracy.\n@inproceedings{wang2022multimodal,\n  title={Multimodal sarcasm target identification in tweets},\n  author={Wang, Jiquan and Sun, Lin and Liu, Yi and Shao, Meizhi and Zheng, Zengwei},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers)},\n  pages={8164--8175},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\nAbstract: We introduce the Qwen-VL series, a set of large-scale vision-language models designed to perceive and understand both text and images.

Failure to detect sarcastic expressions in natural language processing tasks, such as opinion mining and sentiment analysis, leads to poor model performance. Traditional approaches rely heavily on discrete handcrafted features and will incur enormous human costs. It was not until recent that scholars began to employ neural networks to address these limitations and have achieved new state-of-the-art performance. In this work, we propose a novel self-matching network to capture sentence ”incongruity” information by exploring word-to-word interactions. In particular, we calculate the joint information in each word-to-word pair in the input sentence to build a self-matching attention vector, based on which we attend the sentence and build its representation vector. Such a network allows sentence to match within itself word by word and cater to the words of conflict sentiments. In addition, we incorporate a bi-directional LSTM network into our proposed network to retain compositional information. We concatenate incongruity information and compositional information through a Low-rank Bilinear Pooling method to control for potential information redundancy without losing discriminative power. Experiment results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms extant baselines on standard evaluation metrics including precision, recall, F1 score and accuracy.\n@inproceedings{xiong2019sarcasm,\n  title={Sarcasm detection with self-matching networks and low-rank bilinear pooling},\n  author={Xiong, Tao and Zhang, Peiran and Zhu, Hongbo and Yang, Yihui},\n  booktitle={The world wide web conference},\n  pages={2115--2124},\n  year={2019}\n}\n\nAbstract: Automatic sarcasm detection from text is an important classification task that can help identify the actual sentiment in user-generated data, such as reviews or tweets. Despite its usefulness, sarcasm detection remains a challenging task, due to a lack of any vocal intonation or facial gestures in textual data. To date, most of the approaches to addressing the problem have relied on hand-crafted affect features, or pre-trained models of non-contextual word embeddings, such as Word2vec. However, these models inherit limitations that render them inadequate for the task of sarcasm detection. In this paper, we propose two novel deep neural network models for sarcasm detection, namely ACE 1 and ACE 2. Given as input a text passage, the models predict whether it is sarcastic (or not). Our models extend the architecture of BERT by incorporating both affective and contextual features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to directly alter BERT’s architecture and train it from scratch to build a sarcasm classifier. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that the proposed models outperform state-of-the-art models for sarcasm detection with significant margins.\n@inproceedings{babanejad2020affective,\n  title={Affective and contextual embedding for sarcasm detection},\n  author={Babanejad, Nastaran and Davoudi, Heidar and An, Aijun and Papagelis, Manos},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 28th international conference on computational linguistics},\n  pages={225--243},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\nAbstract: Past work in computational sarcasm deals primarily with sarcasm detection. In this paper, we introduce a novel, related problem: sarcasm target identiﬁcation ( i.e. , extracting the target of ridicule in a sarcastic sentence). As a benchmark, we introduce a new dataset for the task. This dataset is manually annotated for the sarcasm target in book snippets and tweets based on our formulation of the task. We then introduce an automatic approach for sarcasm target identiﬁcation. It is based on a combination of two types of extractors: one based on rules, and another consisting of a statistical classiﬁer. Our introductory approach establishes the viability of sarcasm target identiﬁcation, and will serve as a baseline for future work.\n@inproceedings{joshi2018sarcasm,\n  title={Sarcasm target identification: Dataset and an introductory approach},\n  author={Joshi, Aditya and Goel, Pranav and Bhattacharyya, Pushpak and Carman, Mark},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the Eleventh International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC 2018)},\n  year={2018}\n}\n\nAbstract: We present an overview of the 2019 ALTA shared task.

Identification of sarcasm targets can help in many core natural language processing tasks such as aspect based sentiment analysis, opinion mining etc. To begin with, we perform an empirical study of the socio-linguistic features and identify those that are statistically significant in indicating sarcasm targets (p-values in the range(0.05,0.001)). Finally, we present a deep-learning framework augmented with socio-linguistic features to detect sarcasm targets in sarcastic book-snippets and tweets.We achieve a huge improvement in the performance in terms of exact match and dice scores compared to the current state-of-the-art baseline.\n@inproceedings{patro2019deep,\n  title={A deep-learning framework to detect sarcasm targets},\n  author={Patro, Jasabanta and Bansal, Srijan and Mukherjee, Animesh},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2019 conference on empirical methods in natural language processing and the 9th international joint conference on natural language processing (emnlp-ijcnlp)},\n  pages={6336--6342},\n  year={2019}\n}\n\nAbstract: We describe our methods in trying to detect the target of sarcasm as part of ALTA 2019 shared task.

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.\n@inproceedings{brown2020language,\n  title={Language models are few-shot learners},\n  author={Brown, Tom B and Mann, Benjamin and Ryder, Nick and Subbiah, Melanie and Kaplan, Jared and Dhariwal, Prafulla and Neelakantan, Arvind and Shyam, Pranav and Sastry, Girish and Askell, Amanda and others},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 34th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  pages={1877--1901},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\n@article{OpenAI2023GPT4TR,\n  title={GPT-4 Technical Report},\n  author={OpenAI},\n  journal={ArXiv},\n  year={2023},\n  volume={abs/2303.08774},\n  url={https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:257532815}\n}\n\nAbstract: Large language models have been shown to achieve remarkable performance across a variety of natural language tasks using few-shot learning, which drastically reduces the number of task-specific training examples needed to adapt the model to a particular application. To further our understanding of the impact of scale on few-shot learning, we trained a 540-billion parameter, densely activated, Transformer language model, which we call Pathways Language Model PaLM. We trained PaLM on 6144 TPU v4 chips using Pathways, a new ML system which enables highly efficient training across multiple TPU Pods. We demonstrate continued benefits of scaling by achieving state-of-the-art few-shot learning results on hundreds of language understanding and generation benchmarks. On a number of these tasks, PaLM 540B achieves breakthrough performance, outperforming the finetuned state-of-the-art on a suite of multi-step reasoning tasks, and outperforming average human performance on the recently released BIG-bench benchmark. A significant number of BIG-bench tasks showed discontinuous improvements from model scale, meaning that performance steeply increased as we scaled to our largest model. PaLM also has strong capabilities in multilingual tasks and source code generation, which we demonstrate on a wide array of benchmarks. We additionally provide a comprehensive analysis on bias and toxicity, and study the extent of training data memorization with respect to model scale. Finally, we discuss the ethical considerations related to large language models and discuss potential mitigation strategies.\n@article{chowdhery2022palm,\n  title={Palm: Scaling language modeling with pathways},\n  author={Chowdhery, Aakanksha and Narang, Sharan and Devlin, Jacob and Bosma, Maarten and Mishra, Gaurav and Roberts, Adam and Barham, Paul and Chung, Hyung Won and Sutton, Charles and Gehrmann, Sebastian and others},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2204.02311},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\nAbstract: We introduce GPT-NeoX-20B, a 20 billion parameter autoregressive language model trained on the Pile, whose weights will be made freely and openly available to the public through a permissive license.

It is an attempt to open-source a 100B-scale model at least as good as GPT-3 (davinci) and unveil how models of such a scale can be successfully pre-trained. Over the course of this effort, we face numerous unexpected technical and engineering challenges, particularly on loss spikes and divergence. In this paper, we introduce the training process of GLM-130B including its design choices, training strategies for both efficiency and stability, and engineering efforts. The resultant GLM-130B model offers significant outperformance over GPT-3 175B (davinci) on a wide range of popular English benchmarks while the performance advantage is not observed in OPT-175B and BLOOM-176B. It also consistently and significantly outperforms ERNIE TITAN 3.0 260B -- the largest Chinese language model -- across related benchmarks. Finally, we leverage a unique scaling property of GLM-130B to reach INT4 quantization without post training, with almost no performance loss, making it the first among 100B-scale models and more importantly, allowing its effective inference on 4$\\times$RTX 3090 (24G) or 8$\\times$RTX 2080 Ti (11G) GPUs, the most affordable GPUs required for using 100B-scale models.

However, building general-purpose vision-language models is challenging due to the rich input distributions and task diversity resulting from the additional visual input. Although vision-language pretraining has been widely studied, vision-language instruction tuning remains under-explored. In this paper, we conduct a systematic and comprehensive study on vision-language instruction tuning based on the pretrained BLIP-2 models. We gather 26 publicly available datasets, covering a wide variety of tasks and capabilities, and transform them into instruction tuning format. Additionally, we introduce an instruction-aware Query Transformer, which extracts informative features tailored to the given instruction. Trained on 13 held-in datasets, InstructBLIP attains state-of-the-art zero-shot performance across all 13 held-out datasets, substantially outperforming BLIP-2 and larger Flamingo models. Our models also lead to state-of-the-art performance when finetuned on individual downstream tasks (e.g., 90.7% accuracy on ScienceQA questions with image contexts). Furthermore, we qualitatively demonstrate the advantages of InstructBLIP over concurrent multimodal models.

Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).\n@inproceedings{devlin2019bert,\n  title={BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding},\n  author={Devlin, Jacob and Chang, Ming-Wei and Lee, Kenton and Toutanova, Kristina},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)},\n  pages={4171--4186},\n  year={2019}\n}\n\nAbstract: We present a conceptually simple, flexible, and general framework for object instance segmentation. Our approach efficiently detects objects in an image while simultaneously generating a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance. The method, called Mask R-CNN, extends Faster R-CNN by adding a branch for predicting an object mask in parallel with the existing branch for bounding box recognition. Mask R-CNN is simple to train and adds only a small overhead to Faster R-CNN, running at 5 fps. Moreover, Mask R-CNN is easy to generalize to other tasks, e.g., allowing us to estimate human poses in the same framework. We show top results in all three tracks of the COCO suite of challenges, including instance segmentation, bounding-box object detection, and person keypoint detection. Without tricks, Mask R-CNN outperforms all existing, single-model entries on every task, including the COCO 2016 challenge winners. We hope our simple and effective approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in instance-level recognition. Code will be made available.\n@inproceedings{he2017mask,\n  title={Mask r-cnn},\n  author={He, Kaiming and Gkioxari, Georgia and Doll{\\'a}r, Piotr and Girshick, Ross},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE international conference on computer vision},\n  pages={2961--2969},\n  year={2017}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{minderer2022simple,\n  title={Simple open-vocabulary object detection},\n  author={Minderer, Matthias and Gritsenko, Alexey and Stone, Austin and Neumann, Maxim and Weissenborn, Dirk and Dosovitskiy, Alexey and Mahendran, Aravindh and Arnab, Anurag and Dehghani, Mostafa and Shen, Zhuoran and others},\n  booktitle={European Conference on Computer Vision},\n  pages={728--755},\n  year={2022},\n  organization={Springer}\n}\n\nAbstract: In this paper, we present an open-set object detector, called Grounding DINO, by marrying Transformer-based detector DINO with grounded pre-training, which can detect arbitrary objects with human inputs such as category names or referring expressions. The key solution of open-set object detection is introducing language to a closed-set detector for open-set concept generalization. To effectively fuse language and vision modalities, we conceptually divide a closed-set detector into three phases and propose a tight fusion solution, which includes a feature enhancer, a language-guided query selection, and a cross-modality decoder for cross-modality fusion. While previous works mainly evaluate open-set object detection on novel categories, we propose to also perform evaluations on referring expression comprehension for objects specified with attributes. Grounding DINO performs remarkably well on all three settings, including benchmarks on COCO, LVIS, ODinW, and RefCOCO/+/g. Grounding DINO achieves a $52.5$ AP on the COCO detection zero-shot transfer benchmark, i.e., without any training data from COCO. It sets a new record on the ODinW zero-shot benchmark with a mean $26.1$ AP.

These communities provide places for information sharing and collaboration. They also open t he door for inappropriate online activities, such as harassment, i n which some users post messages in a virtual community that are intention- ally offensive to other members of the community. It is a new and challenging task to detect online harassment; currently fe w systems attempt to solve this problem. In this paper, we use a supervised learning approach for dete ct- ing harassment. Our technique employs content features, sentiment features, and contextual features of documents. The experi mental results described herein show that our method achieves significant improvements over several baselines, including Term Frequency- Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) approaches.

The inherently ambiguous nature of sarcasm sometimes makes it hard even for humans to decide whether an utterance is sarcastic or not. Recognition of sarcasm can benefit many sentiment analysis NLP applications, such as review summarization, dialogue systems and review ranking systems. \n \nIn this paper we experiment with semi-supervised sarcasm identification on two very different data sets: a collection of 5.9 million tweets collected from Twitter, and a collection of 66000 product reviews from Amazon. Using the Mechanical Turk we created a gold standard sample in which each sentence was tagged by 3 annotators, obtaining F-scores of 0.78 on the product reviews dataset and 0.83 on the Twitter dataset. We discuss the differences between the datasets and how the algorithm uses them (e.g., for the Amazon dataset the algorithm makes use of structured information). We also discuss the utility of Twitter #sarcasm hashtags for the task.\n@inproceedings{davidov2010semi,\n  title={Semi-supervised recognition of sarcasm in Twitter and Amazon},\n  author={Davidov, Dmitry and Tsur, Oren and Rappoport, Ari},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the fourteenth conference on computational natural language learning},\n  pages={107--116},\n  year={2010}\n}\n\nAbstract: There are a huge number of features which are said to improve Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) accuracy. Practical testing of combinations of such features on large datasets, and theoretical justification of the result, is required. Some features operate on certain models exclusively and for certain problems exclusively, or only for small-scale datasets; while some features, such as batch-normalization and residual-connections, are applicable to the majority of models, tasks, and datasets. We assume that such universal features include Weighted-Residual-Connections (WRC), Cross-Stage-Partial-connections (CSP), Cross mini-Batch Normalization (CmBN), Self-adversarial-training (SAT) and Mish-activation. We use new features: WRC, CSP, CmBN, SAT, Mish activation, Mosaic data augmentation, CmBN, DropBlock regularization, and CIoU loss, and combine some of them to achieve state-of-the-art results: 43.5% AP (65.7% AP50) for the MS COCO dataset at a realtime speed of ~65 FPS on Tesla V100.

The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts every language problem into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled datasets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\", we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more.

Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

However, there is a gap between optimizing the commonly used distance losses for regressing the parameters of a bounding box and maximizing this metric value. The optimal objective for a metric is the metric itself. In the case of axis-aligned 2D bounding boxes, it can be shown that IoU can be directly used as a regression loss. However, IoU has a plateau making it infeasible to optimize in the case of non-overlapping bounding boxes. In this paper, we address the this weakness by introducing a generalized version of IoU as both a new loss and a new metric. By incorporating this generalized IoU ( GIoU) as a loss into the state-of-the art object detection frameworks, we show a consistent improvement on their performance using both the standard, IoU based, and new, GIoU based, performance measures on popular object detection benchmarks such as PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.\n@inproceedings{rezatofighi2019generalized,\n  title={Generalized intersection over union: A metric and a loss for bounding box regression},\n  author={Rezatofighi, Hamid and Tsoi, Nathan and Gwak, JunYoung and Sadeghian, Amir and Reid, Ian and Savarese, Silvio},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition},\n  pages={658--666},\n  year={2019}\n}\n\nAbstract: Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs), such as StarCoder, have demonstrated exceptional performance in code-related tasks.

However, manually creating such instruction data is very time-consuming and labor-intensive. Moreover, humans may struggle to produce high-complexity instructions. In this paper, we show an avenue for creating large amounts of instruction data with varying levels of complexity using LLM instead of humans. Starting with an initial set of instructions, we use our proposed Evol-Instruct to rewrite them step by step into more complex instructions. Then, we mix all generated instruction data to fine-tune LLaMA. We call the resulting model WizardLM. Human evaluations on a complexity-balanced test bed and Vicuna's testset show that instructions from Evol-Instruct are superior to human-created ones. By analyzing the human evaluation results of the high complexity part, we demonstrate that outputs from our WizardLM are preferred to outputs from OpenAI ChatGPT. In GPT-4 automatic evaluation, WizardLM achieves more than 90\\% capacity of ChatGPT on 17 out of 29 skills. Even though WizardLM still lags behind ChatGPT in some aspects, our findings suggest that fine-tuning with AI-evolved instructions is a promising direction for enhancing LLMs. Our code and data are public at https://github.com/nlpxucan/WizardLM\n@article{wizardlm,\n  author       = {Can Xu and\n                  Qingfeng Sun and\n                  Kai Zheng and\n                  Xiubo Geng and\n                  Pu Zhao and\n                  Jiazhan Feng and\n                  Chongyang Tao and\n                  Daxin Jiang},\n  title        = {WizardLM: Empowering Large Language Models to Follow Complex Instructions},\n  journal      = {CoRR},\n  volume       = {abs/2304.12244},\n  year         = {2023},\n  url          = {https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2304.12244},\n  doi          = {10.48550/ARXIV.2304.12244},\n  eprinttype    = {arXiv},\n  eprint       = {2304.12244},\n  timestamp    = {Wed, 03 May 2023 14:12:58 +0200},\n  biburl       = {https://dblp.org/rec/journals/corr/abs-2304-12244.bib},\n  bibsource    = {dblp computer science bibliography, https://dblp.org}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{lin2024explainable,\n    title={Towards Explainable Harmful Meme Detection through Multimodal Debate between Large Language Models},\n    author={Hongzhan Lin and Ziyang Luo and Wei Gao and Jing Ma and Bo Wang and Ruichao Yang},\n    booktitle={The ACM Web Conference 2024},\n    year={2024},\n    address={Singapore},\n}\n\nThe above content represents the relevant literature in this field.

As an important component in deciphering sarcasm, automated Sarcasm Target Identification (STI) is crucial for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in customer service~\\citep{davidov2010semi}, opinion mining~\\citep{riloff2013sarcasm}, and online harassment detection~\\citep{yin2009detection}. Although prior research on STI has primarily centered on textual content~\\citep{joshi2018sarcasm, parameswaran2019detecting}, the surge in multimodal user-generated content has propelled the field of multimodal sarcasm target identification to the forefront of research~\\citep{wang2022multimodal}, making it a significant area of study in both NLP applications and multimedia computing. \n\nThe MSTI task is to extract the entities being ridiculed (i.e., sarcasm targets) from both the text and image in multimodal sarcastic content. Previous work~\\citep{devlin2019bert, bochkovskiy2020yolov4} attempted to straightforwardly integrate a BERT-based textual encoder and a CNN-based visual encoder for just modeling the sarcasm text and image, respectively. The state-of-the-art approach~\\citep{wang2022multimodal} treats MSTI merely as an end-to-end task, primarily focusing on the superficial signals evident in the surface-level text and image. However, a more thorough investigation and understanding of the underlying meanings are essential, particularly in cases where the correlation between image and text is not immediately apparent in multimodal sarcasm~\\citep{tian2023dynamic}.\n{\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\subfigure[]{\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\\linewidth}\n\\centering\n\\scalebox{0.75}{\\includegraphics[width=5cm]{intro_1.pdf}}\n\\label{fig:sarcasm_1}\n\\end{minipage}%\n}%\n\\subfigure[]{\n\\begin{minipage}[t]{0.5\\linewidth}\n\\centering\n\\scalebox{0.75}{\\includegraphics[width=5cm]{intro_2.pdf}}\n\\label{fig:sarcasm_2}\n\\end{minipage}%\n}%\n\\centering\n\\caption{Examples of multimodal sarcasm on \\textbf{Twitter}: (\\textbf{a}) ``\\textit{never seen a \\#\\textcolor{red}{dlr train driver} before. looks like a tough job \\#london}''; (\\textbf{b}) ``\\textit{thank god for no product placement in \\#ukraine \\#eurovision}''. Boxes in \\textcolor{green(ncs)}{green} and words in \\textcolor{red}{red} denote the visual and textual targets.}\n\\label{fig:motivation}\n\\end{figure}}\n\nComprehending and analyzing multimodal sarcasm poses a considerable challenge, because its implicit meaning demands an in-depth understanding and reasoning of commonsense knowledge. For example, as shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:sarcasm_1}, a human checker needs reasonable thoughts between visual and textual sarcasm targets, to understand that the man's leisurely sitting posture in front of the control panel creates a sarcastic contrast between the idea of the train driver's job being difficult and the actual scene. Moreover, as the example shows in Figure~\\ref{fig:sarcasm_2}, the sarcasm target sometimes does not appear explicitly in the text, which makes it more challenging for conventional models to cognize that the example implies that the presence of the Pepsi bottle is a form of product placement, which is often seen as a marketing tactic. We contend the challenge lies in delivering rich multimodal knowledge that consistently assists in deciphering the concealed semantics within the multimodal nature of sarcasm.\n \nIn this paper, we adhere to the following two key principles in the knowledge-augmented design of our approach: 1) LMM Reasoning: To grasp the implicit meanings intrinsic in sarcasm, we resort to the extensive prior knowledge embedded within Large Multimodal Models (LMMs)~\\citep{liu2023visual, bai2023qwen}. This design philosophy enables complex reasoning, thereby enhancing both the MSTI accuracy and explainability; 2) MSD Pre-training: Previous literature~\\citep{joshi2018sarcasm} indicates that MSTI inherently appraises the presence of sarcasm targeting each entity within sarcastic content. Similar to Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD)~\\citep{qin2023mmsd2}, which involves determining the sarcasm in multi-modalities at a holistic content level, MSTI actually engages in finer-grained sarcasm detection at the localized entity level. Considering such a close correlation between MSD and MSTI, it is assumed that insights from the coarser-grained MSD are instrumental in discerning sarcasm targets in the finer-grained MSTI. Thus we devise a cohesive framework to operate on the coarse-to-fine training paradigm, aimed at pinpointing nuanced visual and textual targets of multimodal sarcasm for MSTI by benefitting from LMM reasoning and MSD pre-training.\n\nTo these ends, we propose a novel framework with a \\textbf{\\underline{Co}}arse-to-\\textbf{\\underline{fi}}ne \\textbf{\\underline{Para}}digm, \\textbf{CofiPara}, by leveraging the divergent knowledge extracted from LMMs for multimodal sarcasm target identification. Specifically, we integrate text and image modalities within the coarse-to-fine training paradigm, which consists of two phases: 1) Coarser-grained Sarcasm Detection: Initially, we engage LMMs in critical thinking to generate rationales from both sarcastic and non-sarcastic perspectives. Utilizing these generated sarcasm rationales, we pre-train a smaller model to act as a rationale referee to implicitly extract sarcasm-indicative signals in the competing rationales for sarcasm prediction. This process aligns multimodal features between the sarcasm content and its underlying rationales, alleviating the negative impact of inevitable noise from LMMs through competing rationales; 2) Finer-grained Target Identification: Subsequently, we further fine-tune the smaller model pre-trained in the previous stage for multimodal sarcasm target identification. This phase enhances our model with the multimodal reasoning knowledge, acquired in the pre-training stage and the rationale in sarcastic perspective, to reveal the meanings concealed within the comprehensive multimodal information of sarcasm samples. In this manner, our CofiPara framework could be naturally output as the explanatory basis for deciphering multimodal sarcasm. Extensive experiments conducted on two public sarcasm datasets reveal that our approach far outperforms previous state-of-the-art MSTI methods, and achieves competitive results compared with MSD baselines. The experimental analysis further underscores the enhanced ability to provide superior explainability in the realm of multimodal sarcasm. Our contributions are summarized as follows in three folds:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study multimodal sarcasm from a fresh perspective on explainability in both multimodal targets and natural texts, by exploiting advanced large multimodal models.\n}\n    \\item We propose a universal MSTI framework with the novel coarse-to-fine paradigm that incorporates the multimodal sarcasm target identification and the textual explanation for deciphering the multimodal sarcasm, which enhances sarcasm explainability in conjunction with effective multimodal sarcasm detection.\n    \\item Extensive experiments confirm that our framework could yield superior performance on multimodal sarcasm target identification, and further provide informative explanations for a better understanding of multimodal sarcasm.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\\textbf{MSD.}\nSarcasm detection involves discerning sentiment incongruity within a context, traditionally emphasizing text modality~\\citep{xiong2019sarcasm, babanejad2020affective}. Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD), enhanced by image integration, has garnered growing research interest~\\citep{schifanella2016detecting}. \\citet{cai2019multi} introduced a comprehensive MSD dataset, incorporating text, image, and image attributes, alongside a hierarchical fusion model. Subsequently, a range of studies has utilized attention mechanisms to subtly blend features from different modalities~\\citep{xu2020reasoning, pan2020modeling, tian2023dynamic}. Another line of recent advancements has seen the introduction of graph-based methods for sarcasm detection~\\citep{liang2021multi, liang2022multi, liu2022towards}, which excel in identifying key indicators across modalities. \\citet{qin2023mmsd2} revealed spurious cues in the previous MSD dataset~\\citep{cai2019multi} and provided an alternative refined dataset version. Existing solutions, however, only focused on performing multimodal sarcasm classification (i.e., predicting if a sample is sarcastic) with limited explanations for its prediction. In this paper, we delve into the explainability of multimodal sarcasm from both multimodal targets and textual rationales, aiming to decipher multimodal sarcasm using more intuitive forms and assisting users in gaining a better understanding.\n\n\\textbf{MSTI.}\nRecent advancements in sarcasm analysis have seen a significant focus on Sarcasm Target Identification (STI), with notable contributions from researchers. STI aims to pinpoint the subject of mockery in sarcastic texts. \\citet{joshi2018sarcasm} introduced the concept of STI and discussed its application in the 2019 ALTA shared task~\\citep{molla2019overview}, highlighting evaluation metrics like Exact Match accuracy and F1 score. \\citet{patro2019deep} later developed a deep learning model enhanced with socio-linguistic features for target identification, while \\citet{parameswaran2019detecting} utilized a combination of classifiers, \nfollowed by a rule-based method for extracting textual sarcasm targets. Moreover, \\citet{wang2022multimodal} pioneered STI in multimodal contexts by integrating sequence labeling with object detection in an end-to-end manner, but only capturing the superficial signals of different modalities in sarcasm. In this work, we regard the MSD task as the predecessor pre-training phase of MSTI, to better derive the prior reasoning knowledge absorbed in the coarser-grained auxiliary task MSD to the finer-grained goal task MSTI. \n\n\\textbf{LLMs and LMMs.}\nRecently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional versatility across various tasks. Significant advancements by leading tech companies have resulted in highly proficient, though often proprietary, LLMs~\\citep{brown2020language, OpenAI2023GPT4TR, chowdhery2022palm, team2023gemini}. Meanwhile, the NLP community has seen the rise of open-source LLMs, with publicly shared model weights~\\citep{black2022gpt, zeng2022glm, touvron2023llama, touvron2023llama2, wizardlm, wizardcoder}. More recently, LLMs have also been developed to adapt in processing both textual and visual data, marking a significant advancement. Recent research has focused on constructing versatile multimodal datasets~\\citep{yang2023dawn} from platforms like GPT-4 and GPT-4V~\\citep{OpenAI2023GPT4TR}, fine-tuning open-source LMMs such as LLaVA~\\citep{liu2023visual}, Qwen-VL~\\citep{bai2023qwen}, and other innovative projects~\\citep{Dai2023InstructBLIPTG, wang2023cogvlm}. These LMMs have shown excellent emergent abilities in multimodal tasks. In this work, we foster divergent thinking in LMMs by employing potential sarcasm labels as prompts, which promotes a coarse-to-fine strategy for fine-tuning smaller Language Models (LMs). Combined with MSTI, this design philosophy enhances the sarcasm understanding within the universal framework, steering it towards greater sarcasm explainability.\n\n\n\n\\section{Our Approach}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{model.pdf}\n    \\caption{An overview of our framework, CofiPara, for multimodal sarcasm target identification.} \n    \\label{fig:model}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\textbf{Problem Statement.}\nWe define a multimodal sample as $M=\\{I, T\\}$, which consists of an image $I$ and a text $T$. In the context of the coarser-grained MSD task, the label $y$ of the sample falls into either of the categories: {\\texttt{sarcastic}} or {\\texttt{non-sarcastic}}.  As for the finer-grained MSTI task, the label $y$ is a tuple consisting of a textual sarcasm target $y_{text}$, and a visual bounding box $y_{img}$, where the model is tasked with pinpointing the sarcasm entity targeted within the provided text and image modalities of the \\textit{sarcastic} sample. In this paper, we focus on improving the finer-grained MSTI task by leveraging insights from the coarser-grained MSD task.\n\nClosed to the MSD task, which establishes the presence of sarcasm in holistic semantics at the coarser level, the MSTI task inherently detects sarcasm targeting each entity of the multimodal sarcastic content to explicitly identify the specific sarcasm targets at the finer level~\\citep{joshi2018sarcasm}. This work is designed mainly to integrate MSD and MSTI into a versatile framework with the coarse-to-fine training paradigm, which utilizes MSD as the predecessor foundational stage to facilitate the subsequent MSTI process, through incorporating rationales generated from LMMs.\nThe overview of our model is illustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:model}, which consists of: 1) Divergent Thinking with LMM ($\\S$\\ref{LMM}), 2) Coaser-Grained Pre-Training ($\\S$\\ref{MSD}), and 3) Finer-Grained Fine-Tuning ($\\S$\\ref{MSTI}).\n\\subsection{Divergent Thinking with LMM}\\label{LMM}\n\nGenerally, LLMs can generate reasonable thoughts~\\citep{wei2022chain} to unveil the underlying meaning of the sarcasm. The rationales from LLMs usually express perspectives grounded with commonsense or related to certain social scenarios~\\citep{huang2023chatgpt, lin2024explainable}, which can be used as extensive prior knowledge for smaller downstream models to facilitate decision-making.\nAlthough LLMs have shown emergent abilities in reasoning and interpreting, they still suffer from preconception bias and may generate uncredible content or even make false assertions~\\citep{hu2023bad, lin2023beneath}. Therefore, the downstream decision-maker model would have to be robust enough to alleviate the negative impact imposed by the input noisy LLM-generated rationales. In pursuit of this, we resort to the inspiration of divergent multimodal thinking with vision LLMs, i.e., LMMs, fostering our model to explore a more reliable reasoning pathway from the conflicting and noisy insights provided by LMMs. \n\nGiven an input ${M} = \\{I,T\\}$, we prompt LMMs to generate a pair of competing rationales based on the text $T$, the image $I$, and the potential sarcasm labels ${*} \\in \\{\\texttt{sarcastic}, \\texttt{non-sarcastic}\\}$, by using a prompt template $p$ we curated in advance. To exploit LMMs' divergent reasoning ability, we construct each sample with different potential sarcasm labels, respectively. Specifically, we design the prompt template $p$ as follows:\n\n\\textit{``Given a tweet that consists of a text and an image, please give me a rationale of why the tweet is $\\{*\\}$. \\\\\ntweet text: $\\{T\\}$ \\\\\ntweet image: $\\{I\\}$''\n}\n\nNote that the potential labels $*$ are just used to formalize two opposite standpoints for multimodal reasoning regardless of the ground-truth label. Then we can derive the competing rationales $r_{pos}$ or $r_{neg}$ from LMMs to support the \\texttt{sarcastic} or \\texttt{non-sarcastic} positions.\nBy introducing adversarial labels, we encourage LMMs to adopt diverse perspectives, thereby providing a range of background knowledge enriched with deliberate noise. Because the rationale for the false class ideally contains more useless information than the other one for the ground truth. The contextual subtleties of sarcasm that are pivotal to rival candidate sarcasm categories, can be thus more effectively highlighted and contrasted. This allows the rest of the model to achieve the logical reasoning of the true sarcastic intent by considering it from diverse perspectives, while moderating vulnerability to the potential noise in the LMM-generated rationales.\n\n\\subsection{Coarser-Grained Pre-Training}\\label{MSD}\n\nGiven the close correlation between the coarser-grained multimodal sarcasm detection with the finer-grained multimodal sarcasm target identification, we advocate for initial pre-training in multimodal sarcasm detection, allowing the model to grasp the essence of sarcasm preliminarily. This foundational understanding could set the stage for a more nuanced and detailed identification of sarcasm targets in subsequent fine-tuning.\n\\noindent\\textbf{Encoding and Fusion.} \nFor an input sample ${M} = \\{I,\\hat{T}\\}$ packed with the generated competing rationales, where $\\hat{T} = \\{T, r_{pos}, r_{neg}\\}$ is the input text, we first extract textual and visual features as:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\nH_T =\\mathsf{E}_T(\\hat{T}), \n~~\nI_E =\\mathsf{E}_I(I),\n\\end{equation}}\nwhere $H_{T} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m \\times d}$ is the token embedding output by the text encoder $\\mathsf{E}_T(\\cdot)$ implemented by Transformer Encoder~\\citep{raffel2020exploring}, $m$ is the input token length and $d$ is the dimension of hidden states. $\\mathsf{E}_I(\\cdot)$ denotes the image encoder based on Vision Transformer~\\citep{liu2021swin}, used to fetch the patch-level features of the image with $n$ patches, which are projected into the visual features $I_E \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Since both the text and image encoders are designed as Transformer-based, the embeddings shaped by the isomorphic encoding structure can enhance consecutive multimodal fusion during encoding~\\citep{liu2023grounding}.\nThen, to align the semantics in the text and image, we adopt a bi-directional attention module based on the cross-attention mechanism. Taking the text-to-image cross-attention ${CrossAttn}(H_T,I_E)$ as an example, we define the query, key and value as $\\{Q_{{T}},  K_{{I}}, V_{{I}}\\} = \\{H_T W_Q, I_E W_K, I_E W_V\\}$, where $\\{W_{Q}, W_{K}, W_{V}\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d_k}$ are trainable weights. Then the calculation is as follows:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{aligned}\nH_{T}^0  & =\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q_T K_I^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right) V_I,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\label{c_attn}\n\\end{equation}}\nWith Equation~\\ref{c_attn}, similarly, we can calculate the image-to-text cross-attention. Combing the two cross-attention modules together, we fuse the multimodal features during encoding as follows:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{aligned}\nH_{T}^0 &= {CrossAttn}(H_T, I_E), \\\\\nI_B &= {CrossAttn}(I_E,H_T),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}} where $H_{T}^0, I_B$ are the attended textual and visual features, respectively. \nTo optimize the information integration of multimodal sarcasm with competing rationales, we further develop a query selection mechanism to prioritize image region features that exhibit higher correlations with the input text. This yields:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\arg \\max_n \\left(\\max_m \\left(I_B {H_{T}^0}^{\\top} \\right)\\right),\n\\end{equation}}\nwith which we obtain the index of the topmost relevant local visual features, queried by the textual features ${H_{T}^0}$ from the global visual features $I_B$. We name the selected local visual features as $I_Q$.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Cross-Modality Text Decoding.}  Based on the attended textual features $H_{T}^0$ and query-selected local visual features $I_Q$, we then devise a multimodal decoding strategy with textual outputs to infer sarcasm for MSD. Specifically, during decoding, we only exploit a text-to-image cross-attention module to attain the textual features attended with the visual ones:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n{H_T^i}_{attn} &= {CrossAttn}(H_{T}^i, I_Q),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}}\nwhere $H_T^i$ is the textual feature input of the $i^{th}$ LM decoder layer, and ${H_T^i}_{attn}$ is the attended textual feature output of the cross-attention ${CrossAttn}$. Then by adding the attended features ${H_T^i}_{attn}$ to the output of the $i^{th}$ LM decoder $LM_{dec}^i$, the fused intermediate features $H_T^{i+1}$ fed into the next LM decoder layer are:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\nH_T^{i+1} & = LM_{dec}^i(H_T^i) + {H_T^i}_{attn}.\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}}\nAfter $L$ layers of cross-modality LM decoder, we have the final textual representations $H_T^L$, further decoded as the text output to clearly express whether the sample is sarcastic. Finally, we train the model $f$ by minimizing the following loss:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{L}_{text} = CE(f(I,\\hat{T}),y),\n\\label{eq6}\n\\end{equation}}\nwhere $CE(\\cdot)$ denotes the cross-entropy loss between the generated label token and ground truth label $y$ for MSD. During the coarser-grained pre-training, the model is trained to distill the essence and discard irrelevant elements from the divergent thinking of LMMs about sarcasm. Such a process could fortify our model's resilience in the subsequent fine-tuning stage for MSTI, ensuring robustness against the potential inaccuracies stemming from LMMs, leading to a more independent and refined thought of the LMM-generated rationales.\n\\subsection{Finer-Grained Fine-Tuning} \n\\label{MSTI}\nAfter the coarser-grained pre-training stage, our model could be resilient against the potential variation and bias in LMMs through the competing rationales, to first comprehend what constitutes sarcasm. As the goal of our approach is to identify both the textual and visual sarcasm targets for further deciphering sarcasm, we conduct the finer-grained fine-tuning stage for MSTI, which shares the same model architecture, parameters of the multimodal encoding and text decoding procedures as $\\S$\\ref{MSD} but differs in the text decoding output and an additional image decoding procedure.\n\nDifferent from the pre-training stage in $\\S$\\ref{MSD}, the sample $M$ in MSTI is set as \\textit{sarcastic} prior due to the nature of this specific task~\\citep{wang2022multimodal}.\nThus the input text for a given \\textit{sarcastic} sample $M$ is formed as $\\hat{T} = \\{T, r_{pos}\\}$ in this stage, where we only provide the text $T$ and the LMM-generated rationale $r_{pos}$ that explains why $M$ is sarcastic. For the cross-modality text decoding, we generate the predicted textual sarcasm targets that are entities in the text $T$. Then the textual target loss $\\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{text}$ can be computed akin to that outlined in Equation~\\ref{eq6}.   \n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Cross-Modality Image Decoding.} \nFor visual object detection, we use a cross-modality image decoder to discern the visual sarcasm target, where the textual features $H_T^0$ and the global visual features $I_B$ are used to attend to the local visual features $I_Q$ in each Transformer decoder layer:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& I_Q^{j^{\\prime}}={SelfAttn}\\left(I_Q^j\\right), \\\\\n& I_Q^{j^{\\prime \\prime}}={CrossAttn}\\left(I_Q^{j^{\\prime}}, I_B\\right), \\\\\n& I_Q^{j+1}={CrossAttn}\\left(I_Q^{j^{\\prime \\prime}}, H_T^0\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}}\nwhere ${SelfAttn}(\\cdot)$ denotes self-attention, and $I_Q^j$ is the input of the $j^{th}$ Transformer decoder layer. After $K$ layers of the image decoder, we have the final visual features $I_Q^K$. Afterwards, we decode $I_Q^K$ as the image output consisting of a bounding box output and its confidence score. Following previous object detection work~\\citep{zhang2022dino}, we use the L1 loss $\\mathcal{L}_{l1}$ and the GIOU~\\citep{rezatofighi2019generalized} loss $\\mathcal{L}_{giou}$ for bounding box regressions, and the cross-entropy classification loss $\\mathcal{L}_{cls}$ for confidence scores as the joint optimization objective:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\n\\mathcal{L}_{img} = \\alpha  \\mathcal{L}_{l1} + \\beta  \\mathcal{L}_{giou} +\\gamma  \\mathcal{L}_{cls},\n\\label{eq_imgloss}\n\\end{equation}}\nwhere $\\alpha, \\beta$ and $\\gamma$ are the hyper-parameters to scale the losses, $\\mathcal{L}_{img}$ is the visual target loss. Finally, the overall training loss $\\mathcal{L}$ for this stage is:\n{\n\\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\setlength{\\belowdisplayskip}{0.1cm}\n\\begin{equation}\\mathcal{L} = \\mathcal{L}_{img} + \\hat{\\mathcal{L}}_{text}.\n\\end{equation}}\n\n\\paragraph{Model Training.}\nWe implement model training following a coarse-to-fine paradigm: 1) Pre-training on the coarser-grained MSD task by minimizing $\\mathcal{L}_{text}$, and 2) Fine-tuning on the finer-grained MSTI task by minimizing $\\mathcal{L}$, where the auxiliary task MSD is the predecessor training phase of the goal task MSTI. To this end, we unify the classification task for MSD and the sequence tagging task for textual target identification in MSTI into a text generation task. Note that for model testing on MSD, we use the model parameters obtained after the coarser-grained pre-training; in terms of the goal task MSTI, we directly input the test sarcastic sample into our finer-grained fine-tuned model to identify multimodal sarcasm targets. \n\n\n\n```\n\n## Experimental Setup\n\n```json\n[{\"name\": \"Multimodal Sarcasm Detection (MSD)\", \"description\": \"This experiment focuses on the coarser-grained pre-training stage for multimodal sarcasm detection.

From these results, we have the following observations: 1) Compared to graph-based methods such as CMGCN and HKE and routing-based DynRT, Att-BERT that relies on semantic understanding has better performance, indicating that this task requires models to capture deep semantic information rather than superficial attributes. 2) Multi-view CLIP shows an overall advantage in its ability to align textual and visual features, and the isomorphic structures of text and image encoder also contribute to its superiority. 3) Our proposed CofiPara-\\textsc{Msd} surpasses the leading baseline by 1.39\\% and 3.49\\% in accuracy and F1 score, additionally demonstrating a more balanced performance in terms of recall and precision, despite not primarily targeting the MSD task. The distinctive advantage of our model lies in the fact that while all the baselines solely focus on recognition, our model is equipped with rationales from divergent thinking with LMMs, which empowers our model to effectively uncover sarcastic content by adeptly leveraging the interplay between seemingly unrelated textual and visual elements within sarcasm.\n\\noindent\\textbf{Target Identification Performance.}\nTable \\ref{msti_res} shows the performance (\\%) of our method versus unimodal and multimodal baselines on the goal task MSTI. It can be observed that: 1) The unimodal methods, like text-modality models in the first group and image-modality models in the second group, fall short in simultaneously identifying both visual and textual sarcasm targets compared to the multimodal methods in the third group. 2) The textual target identification performance of visual grounding models (i.e., OWL-ViT and Grounding DINO), is hindered by the discrepancy between the MSTI task and their original pre-training objectives. Additionally, the lack of a consistent one-to-one correspondence between textual and visual targets in MSTI samples further contributes to their suboptimal performance. 3) Our method drastically excels in EM and AP50 compared to baselines, especially in visual target identification. We observe that CofiPara-\\textsc{Msti} improves textual target identification performance by 3.26\\% on average EM score compared to MSTI-VB, suggesting that our model is more precise in discerning sarcasm targets in the text modality of multimodal contents. On the other hand, our model exhibits a substantial superiority in visual target identification performance, especially on the AP50 metric, for an average improvement of 14.88\\% over the best visual performed baseline, indicating that our model can capture the correct visual targets within the image modality that contain sarcastic meanings, while baseline models perform poorly by simply identifying object rather than sarcasm targets, which further implies that our model displays a better understanding of multimodal sarcasm.\n\n\n\\subsection{Ablation Study of Target Identification}\n\n\\begin{table}[]\n\\resizebox{\\linewidth}{!}{\\begin{tabular}{lccccc}\n\\toprule\n                               & EM    & F1    & AP    & AP50  & AP75  \\\\ \\hline\nCofiPara-\\textsc{Msti}                  & 32.26 & 50.27 & 13.79 & 32.49 & 12.01 \\\\ \\hline\nw/o MSD               & 30.24 & 49.61 & 13.72 & 30.39 & 12.15 \\\\\nw/o LMM                 & 30.91 & 48.32 & 07.50 & 19.36 & 04.22 \\\\\nw/o MSD\\&LMM & 30.10 & 50.72 & 06.34 & 17.21 & 04.61 \\\\ \\toprule\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{Ablation results on MSTI2.0 test set.}\n\\label{abla_msti_test}\n\\end{table}\n\nAs MSTI is our goal task, we conduct ablative studies on MSTI2.0 test data with the following variants: 1) \\textit{w/o MSD}: Simply train our model on the MSTI task without knowledge from pre-training on MSD.\n2) \\textit{w/o LMM}: Use model parameters initialized by pre-training on the MSD task, and fine-tune directly on the MSTI task without knowledge from LMMs. 3) \\textit{w/o MSD\\&LMM}: Train our model directly on the MSTI task without any knowledge of LMM reasoning and MSD pre-training.\n\nAs demonstrated in Table \\ref{abla_msti_test}, our model shows different degrees of performance degradation when MSD pre-training or LMM reasoning knowledge is ablated, indicating the effectiveness of our proposed method. Specifically, visual target identification performances show significant degradations by 2.10\\% and 13.13\\% on AP50 for \\textit{w/o MSD} and \\textit{w/o LMM} settings, respectively. This indicates that both LMM reasoning and MSD pre-training are helpful in identifying sarcasm targets, and that external LMM knowledge has a relatively larger impact on visual performance. We also notice that, the \\textit{w/o LMM} setting has relatively mild improvement over \\textit{w/o MSD\\&LMM}. This can be attributed to the fact that although the MSD pre-training itself may not necessarily significantly enhance model performance on the MSTI task with a large margin, it could help our model learn to implicitly ignore useless expressions and extract informative signals in the rationales from LMMs, highlighting its synergistic complementary with the LMM knowledge.\n\n\\subsection{Case Study of Explainability}\n\\label{case_study_sec}\n\nTo better understand the mechanism of how LMM-generated rationales facilitate sarcasm target identification, we conduct a case study on the correctly predicted samples for better sarcasm explainability, as shown in Figure \\ref{case_study}, where visual sarcasm targets are annotated by green rectangles and textual sarcasm targets are highlighted in red italics.\n\nIn these examples, we observe that: 1) rationales generated by LMM help promote the connections between two modalities. As shown in Figure \\ref{case_study}(a), we notice that in the generated rationale, the image is depicted as a photo of Narendra Modi, which is then linked to the man who makes a refusing gesture in the picture. By introducing the connection between the word ``narendramodi'' and the man in the image, the target can be more easily recognized by our model; 2) on the other hand, rationales can complement background messages that are not given in the original texts and images, including both common sense and political knowledge. For example, in Figure \\ref{case_study}(a), the rationale first recognizes the man as Prime Minister of India, and then offers a correction ``for the first time ever'' to the non-standard abbreviation of ``for d 1st time ever'', which is further explained as an expression of sarcastic tone towards Modi. Similarly, in Figure \\ref{case_study}(b), LMM interprets ``mlk'' as Martin Luther King Jr. Day, the day to memorize dissenters who fought for civil rights, while the fact that police are arresting the dissenter in the image is in conflict with the context that expresses thanks to police, as well as the hashtag \\textit{\\#thinblueline}. The sarcasm target in the image is explained as the unjust political situation for people who fight for human rights, which is depicted in the image but outside the text. In this way, the rich but implicit correlations between the sarcasm text and image could be explained in visualized targets and readable snippets, which are also potentially valuable for aiding human checkers in verifying the sarcasm.\n\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth, scale=1.00]{casestudy.pdf}\n    \\caption{Examples of correctly identified samples.} \n    \\label{case_study}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\n\nIn this paper, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine paradigm to decode the implicit meanings hidden beneath the surface of texts and images in multimodal sarcasm for MSTI, by leveraging rich prior knowledge from LMM reasoning and MSD pre-training. We first inspired divergent thinking with LMMs to derive competing rationales for coarser-grained pre-training of a small language model on MSD. Then we conducted finer-grained fine-tuning of the model on MSTI. Comprehensive experiments and analyses confirm the advantages of our framework. Future efforts aim to enhance our research by focusing on explicitly extracting useful information from generated rationales, to further relieve the inherent bias and variation in LMMs.\n\n\n\n```\n\n"

                "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) reflect societal norms and biases, especially about gender. While societal biases and stereotypes have been extensively researched in various NLP applications, there is a surprising gap for emotion analysis. However, emotion and gender are closely linked in societal discourse. E.g., women are often thought of as more empathetic, while men's anger is more socially accepted. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study of gendered emotion attribution in five state-of-the-art LLMs (open- and closed-source). We investigate whether emotions are gendered, and whether these variations are based on societal stereotypes. We prompt the models to adopt a gendered persona and attribute emotions to an event like 'When I had a serious argument with a dear person'. We then analyze the emotions generated by the models in relation to the gender-event pairs. We find that all models consistently exhibit gendered emotions, influenced by gender stereotypes. These findings are in line with established research in psychology and gender studies. Our study sheds light on the complex societal interplay between language, gender, and emotion. The reproduction of emotion stereotypes in LLMs allows us to use those models to study the topic in detail, but raises questions about the predictive use of those same LLMs for emotion applications."

First, for medium-sized LLMs, we introduce evaluation metrics and debiasing methods from the perspectives of intrinsic bias and extrinsic bias, respectively. Then, for large-sized LLMs, we introduce recent fairness research, including fairness evaluation, reasons for bias, and debiasing methods. Finally, we discuss and provide insight on the challenges and future directions for the development of fairness in LLMs."

                "abstract": "In NLP, recent work has seen increased focus on spurious correlations between various features and labels in training data, and how these influence model behavior. However, the presence and effect of such correlations are typically examined feature by feature. We investigate the cumulative impact on a model of many such intersecting features. Using a new statistical method, we examine whether such spurious patterns in data appear in models trained on the data. We select two tasks -- natural language inference and duplicate-question detection -- for which any unigram feature on its own should ideally be uninformative, which gives us a large pool of automatically extracted features with which to experiment. The large size of this pool allows us to investigate the intersection of features spuriously associated with (potentially different) labels. We then apply an optimization approach to *reweight* the training data, reducing thousands of spurious correlations, and examine how doing so affects models trained on the reweighted data. Surprisingly, though this method can successfully reduce lexical biases in the training data, we still find strong evidence of corresponding bias in the trained models, including worsened bias for slightly more complex features (bigrams). We close with discussion about the implications of our results on what it means to\"debias\"training data, and how issues of data quality can affect model bias."

In this work, we cast auditing as an optimization problem, where we automatically search for input-output pairs that match a desired target behavior. For example, we might aim to find a non-toxic input that starts with\"Barack Obama\"that a model maps to a toxic output. This optimization problem is difficult to solve as the set of feasible points is sparse, the space is discrete, and the language models we audit are non-linear and high-dimensional. To combat these challenges, we introduce a discrete optimization algorithm, ARCA, that jointly and efficiently optimizes over inputs and outputs. Our approach automatically uncovers derogatory completions about celebrities (e.g.\"Barack Obama is a legalized unborn\"->\"child murderer\"), produces French inputs that complete to English outputs, and finds inputs that generate a specific name. Our work offers a promising new tool to uncover models' failure-modes before deployment."

Prior work creates evaluations with crowdwork (which is time-consuming and expensive) or existing data sources (which are not always available). Here, we automatically generate evaluations with LMs. We explore approaches with varying amounts of human effort, from instructing LMs to write yes/no questions to making complex Winogender schemas with multiple stages of LM-based generation and filtering. Crowdworkers rate the examples as highly relevant and agree with 90-100% of labels, sometimes more so than corresponding human-written datasets. We generate 154 datasets and discover new cases of inverse scaling where LMs get worse with size. Larger LMs repeat back a dialog user's preferred answer (\"sycophancy\") and express greater desire to pursue concerning goals like resource acquisition and goal preservation. We also find some of the first examples of inverse scaling in RL from Human Feedback (RLHF), where more RLHF makes LMs worse. For example, RLHF makes LMs express stronger political views (on gun rights and immigration) and a greater desire to avoid shut down. Overall, LM-written evaluations are high-quality and let us quickly discover many novel LM behaviors."

To do so, we empirically simulate various alternative constructions for a given benchmark based on seemingly innocuous modifications (such as paraphrasing or random-sampling) that maintain the essence of their social bias. On two well-known social bias benchmarks (Winogender and BiasNLI), we observe that these shallow modifications have a surprising effect on the resulting degree of bias across various models and consequently the relative ordering of these models when ranked by measured bias.

Several works have utilized templates for fairness evaluation, which allow researchers to quantify social biases in the absence of test sets with protected attribute labels. While template evaluation can be a convenient and helpful diagnostic tool to understand model deficiencies, it often uses a simplistic and limited set of templates. In this paper, we study whether bias measurements are sensitive to the choice of templates used for benchmarking. Specifically, we investigate the instability of bias measurements by manually modifying templates proposed in previous works in a semantically-preserving manner and measuring bias across these modifications. We find that bias values and resulting conclusions vary considerably across template modifications on four tasks, ranging from an 81% reduction (NLI) to a 162% increase (MLM) in (task-specific) bias measurements. Our results indicate that quantifying fairness in LLMs, as done in current practice, can be brittle and needs to be approached with more care and caution."

Importantly, our framework bypasses the need to retrain expensive models and allows us to estimate causal effects based on observational data alone. Addressing the problem of extracting factual knowledge from pretrained language models (PLMs), we focus on simple data statistics such as co-occurrence counts and show that these statistics do influence the predictions of PLMs, suggesting that such models rely on shallow heuristics.

Many datasets for measuring bias currently exist, but they are restricted in their coverage of demographic axes and are commonly used with preset bias tests that presuppose which types of biases models can exhibit. In this work, we present a new, more inclusive bias measurement dataset, HolisticBias, which includes nearly 600 descriptor terms across 13 different demographic axes. HolisticBias was assembled in a participatory process including experts and community members with lived experience of these terms. These descriptors combine with a set of bias measurement templates to produce over 450,000 unique sentence prompts, which we use to explore, identify, and reduce novel forms of bias in several generative models. We demonstrate that HolisticBias is effective at measuring previously undetectable biases in token likelihoods from language models, as well as in an offensiveness classifier. We will invite additions and amendments to the dataset, which we hope will serve as a basis for more easy-to-use and standardized methods for evaluating bias in NLP models."

In this work, we automatically find cases where a target LM behaves in a harmful way, by generating test cases (“red teaming”) using another LM. We evaluate the target LM’s replies to generated test questions using a classifier trained to detect offensive content, uncovering tens of thousands of offensive replies in a 280B parameter LM chatbot. We explore several methods, from zero-shot generation to reinforcement learning, for generating test cases with varying levels of diversity and difficulty. Furthermore, we use prompt engineering to control LM-generated test cases to uncover a variety of other harms, automatically finding groups of people that the chatbot discusses in offensive ways, personal and hospital phone numbers generated as the chatbot’s own contact info, leakage of private training data in generated text, and harms that occur over the course of a conversation. Overall, LM-based red teaming is one promising tool (among many needed) for finding and fixing diverse, undesirable LM behaviors before impacting users."

We manually verify the quality of our corpus and use it to evaluate gender bias in various coreference resolution and machine translation models. We find that all tested models tend to over-rely on gender stereotypes when presented with natural inputs, which may be especially harmful when deployed in commercial systems. Finally, we show that our dataset lends itself to finetuning a coreference resolution model, finding it mitigates bias on a held out set.

                "abstract": "Much recent work in NLP has documented dataset artifacts, bias, and spurious correlations between input features and output labels. However, how to tell which features have “spurious” instead of legitimate correlations is typically left unspecified. In this work we argue that for complex language understanding tasks, all simple feature correlations are spurious, and we formalize this notion into a class of problems which we call competency problems. For example, the word “amazing” on its own should not give information about a sentiment label independent of the context in which it appears, which could include negation, metaphor, sarcasm, etc. We theoretically analyze the difficulty of creating data for competency problems when human bias is taken into account, showing that realistic datasets will increasingly deviate from competency problems as dataset size increases. This analysis gives us a simple statistical test for dataset artifacts, which we use to show more subtle biases than were described in prior work, including demonstrating that models are inappropriately affected by these less extreme biases. Our theoretical treatment of this problem also allows us to analyze proposed solutions, such as making local edits to dataset instances, and to give recommendations for future data collection and model design efforts that target competency problems."

Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English.

We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models."

                "abstract": "Recent advances in deep learning techniques have enabled machines to generate cohesive open-ended text when prompted with a sequence of words as context. While these models now empower many downstream applications from conversation bots to automatic storytelling, they have been shown to generate texts that exhibit social biases. To systematically study and benchmark social biases in open-ended language generation, we introduce the Bias in Open-Ended Language Generation Dataset (BOLD), a large-scale dataset that consists of 23,679 English text generation prompts for bias benchmarking across five domains: profession, gender, race, religion, and political ideology. We also propose new automated metrics for toxicity, psycholinguistic norms, and text gender polarity to measure social biases in open-ended text generation from multiple angles. An examination of text generated from three popular language models reveals that the majority of these models exhibit a larger social bias than human-written Wikipedia text across all domains. With these results we highlight the need to benchmark biases in open-ended language generation and caution users of language generation models on downstream tasks to be cognizant of these embedded prejudices."

With this in mind, we present the Pile : an 825 GiB English text corpus tar-geted at training large-scale language models. The Pile is constructed from 22 diverse high-quality subsets—both existing and newly constructed—many of which derive from academic or professional sources. Our evaluation of the untuned performance of GPT-2 and GPT-3 on the Pile shows that these models struggle on many of its components, such as academic writing. Conversely, models trained on the Pile improve signiﬁcantly over both Raw CC and CC-100 on all components of the Pile, while improving performance on downstream evaluations. Through an in-depth exploratory analysis, we document potentially concerning aspects of the data for prospective users. We make publicly available the code used in its construction. 1"

However, there is ample evidence that they use the cultural biases that are undoubtedly present in the corpora they are trained on, implicitly creating harm with biased representations. To measure some forms of social bias in language models against protected demographic groups in the US, we introduce the Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs benchmark (CrowS-Pairs). CrowS-Pairs has 1508 examples that cover stereotypes dealing with nine types of bias, like race, religion, and age. In CrowS-Pairs a model is presented with two sentences: one that is more stereotyping and another that is less stereotyping. The data focuses on stereotypes about historically disadvantaged groups and contrasts them with advantaged groups. We find that all three of the widely-used MLMs we evaluate substantially favor sentences that express stereotypes in every category in CrowS-Pairs. As work on building less biased models advances, this dataset can be used as a benchmark to evaluate progress."

Inspired by principles of behavioral testing in software engineering, we introduce CheckList, a task-agnostic methodology for testing NLP models. CheckList includes a matrix of general linguistic capabilities and test types that facilitate comprehensive test ideation, as well as a software tool to generate a large and diverse number of test cases quickly. We illustrate the utility of CheckList with tests for three tasks, identifying critical failures in both commercial and state-of-art models. In a user study, a team responsible for a commercial sentiment analysis model found new and actionable bugs in an extensively tested model. In another user study, NLP practitioners with CheckList created twice as many tests, and found almost three times as many bugs as users without it."

                "abstract": "A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people, e.g., Asians are good at math or African Americans are athletic. Such beliefs (biases) are known to hurt target groups. Since pretrained language models are trained on large real-world data, they are known to capture stereotypical biases. It is important to quantify to what extent these biases are present in them. Although this is a rapidly growing area of research, existing literature lacks in two important aspects: 1) they mainly evaluate bias of pretrained language models on a small set of artificial sentences, even though these models are trained on natural data 2) current evaluations focus on measuring bias without considering the language modeling ability of a model, which could lead to misleading trust on a model even if it is a poor language model. We address both these problems. We present StereoSet, a large-scale natural English dataset to measure stereotypical biases in four domains: gender, profession, race, and religion. We contrast both stereotypical bias and language modeling ability of popular models like BERT, GPT-2, RoBERTa, and XLnet. We show that these models exhibit strong stereotypical biases. Our data and code are available at https://stereoset.mit.edu."

Although our case study focuses on gender bias, the proposed technique is generalizable to unveiling other biases, including in multiclass settings, such as racial and religious biases."

Accordingly, we extend the Word Embedding Association Test to measure bias in sentence encoders. We then test several sentence encoders, including state-of-the-art methods such as ELMo and BERT, for the social biases studied in prior work and two important biases that are difficult or impossible to test at the word level. We observe mixed results including suspicious patterns of sensitivity that suggest the test’s assumptions may not hold in general.

We use the dataset to examine 219 automatic sentiment analysis systems that took part in a recent shared task, SemEval-2018 Task 1 ‘Affect in Tweets’.

After considering different solutions inspired by the hashing literature, we propose a method built upon product quantization to store the word embeddings. While the original technique leads to a loss in accuracy, we adapt this method to circumvent the quantization artifacts. As a result, our approach produces a text classifier, derived from the fastText approach, which at test time requires only a fraction of the memory compared to the original one, without noticeably sacrificing the quality in terms of classification accuracy. Our experiments carried out on several benchmarks show that our approach typically requires two orders of magnitude less memory than fastText while being only slightly inferior with respect to accuracy. As a result, it outperforms the state of the art by a good margin in terms of the compromise between memory usage and accuracy."

Such a danger is facing us with word embedding, a popular framework to represent text data as vectors which has been used in many machine learning and natural language processing tasks. We show that even word embeddings trained on Google News articles exhibit female/male gender stereotypes to a disturbing extent. This raises concerns because their widespread use, as we describe, often tends to amplify these biases. Geometrically, gender bias is first shown to be captured by a direction in the word embedding. Second, gender neutral words are shown to be linearly separable from gender definition words in the word embedding. Using these properties, we provide a methodology for modifying an embedding to remove gender stereotypes, such as the association between the words receptionist and female, while maintaining desired associations such as between the words queen and female. Using crowd-worker evaluation as well as standard benchmarks, we empirically demonstrate that our algorithms significantly reduce gender bias in embeddings while preserving the its useful properties such as the ability to cluster related concepts and to solve analogy tasks. The resulting embeddings can be used in applications without amplifying gender bias."

                "\\label{sec:methodology}\n\nThis section introduces \\textbf{UnStereoEval}, an evaluation framework specifically tailored for assessing \\lms' fairness in non-stereotypical gender scenarios. \nWe begin by describing how we measure word- and sentence-level gender correlations. \nSubsequently, we show how to use sentence-level correlations to produce non-stereotypical evaluation benchmarks.\nFinally, we define the fairness metrics that we use in this paper.\n\n\\subsection{Gender co-occurring words}\n\\label{ssec:pmi}\n\nWord-gender correlations are determined empirically using word co-occurrence statistics from \\PILE~-- a high-quality and publicly available pretraining set used to train popular \\lms~\\citep{gao-2021-PILE}.\nAfter tokenizing and removing stopwords, both word and word co-occurrence counts are collected over windows of size 10 that are swept over all the pretraining text in \\PILE~\\citep{razeghi-etal-2022-snoopy}.\nOne method to determine word-gender co-occurrences using word statistics is through \\ac{PMI}, defined as $\\mathrm{PMI}(w, g) = \\log \\frac{\\pdata(w, g)}{\\pdata(w)\\pdata(g)}$.\nSpecifically, for a corpus $D$, \\ac{PMI} estimates how much more likely a word $w$ (e.g., \\tex{vacations}) is to co-occur with a gendered word $g$ (e.g., \\tex{she}) than would be expected by random chance.\n\nTo determine whether a word is more likely to correlate with one gender, we propose the PMI-based score \\pmidiff defined in Equation \\ref{eq:pmi-diff-heshe}. \nNote that, similarly to previous literature~\\citep{Bolukbasi2016}, we use the pronouns \\tex{he} and \\tex{she} to represent gendered groups\\footnote{Throughout the paper, we use \\pmidiff to quantify word-level gender correlations.}. \nPositive \\pmidiff values imply stronger correlations between the words and the female group, whilst negative values imply stronger correlations with the male group.\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:pmi-diff-heshe}\n\\delta(w) = \\mathrm{PMI}(w, \\text{'she'}) - \\mathrm{PMI}(w, \\text{'he'}),\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{Enforcing minimal gender co-occurrences}\n\\label{ssec:pmi-constraints}\n\nTo evaluate LMs in non-stereotypical scenarios, we use sentence pairs that have minimal gender correlations.\nThe gender correlation of a sentence can be measured by combining the $|\\rvs|$ word-level scores in the sentence $\\rvs = w_1 w_2 ... w_{|\\rvs|}$ into a single score.\nThere are many ways of combining word-level scores, including  averaging word-level scores or computing the fraction of words exhibiting small gender correlations.\nIn this work, we build upon existing research on the impact of individual words on LM behavior~\\citep{gardner-etal-2021-competency} and quantify the sentence-level gender correlations in terms of a single most prominent gender co-occurring word score in the pair (see Equation \\ref{eq:max-gender-pmi}).\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:max-gender-pmi}\n\\mathrm{MaxPMI}(\\rvs) = \\argmax_{\\delta' \\in \\{\\delta(w_1),...,\\delta(w_{|\\rvs|})\\}} |\\delta'|\n\\end{align}\n\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\\textwidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{images/camera-ready/results/lineplot__datasetpct_vs_maxpmi.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Percentage of examples remaining after enforcing gender co-occurrences across 5 datasets} (i.e., $|\\mathrm{MaxPMI}(\\rvs)| \\leq \\eta$). When $\\eta=0.5$, three datasets preserve less than $35\\%$ of its original sentences.}\n    \\label{fig:num-sentences-by-max-pmi-epsilon}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\nUsing the previous definition, a sentence $\\rvs$ is said to be devoid of gender co-occurring words if all its words exhibit gender correlations lower than a user-defined threshold $\\eta$, i.e., if $|\\mathrm{MaxPMI}(\\rvs)| \\leq \\eta$ is satisfied. \nThis constraint can then be used to filter out sentences of gender-invariant datasets, such as Winobias (\\WB) or Winogender (\\WG), and, thus, restrict the evaluation to a subset with minimal gender correlations. \nDespite leading to less stereotypical datasets, lower values of $\\eta$ may also lead to considerably smaller datasets (see Figure \\ref{fig:num-sentences-by-max-pmi-epsilon}). \nAs observed, the reduction in size is larger when applying the constraints to stereotypical datasets, like \\WB and \\WG, since they are created to surface stereotypical biases (e.g., gender-occupation, gender-emotion) known to be pervasive in training datasets.\n\\subsection{Benchmark construction}\n\\label{ssec:benchmark}\n\nThe focus on stereotypes in popular fairness benchmarks makes it impractical to enforce gender co-occurrence constraints, often leading to substantially smaller datasets with limited syntactic and semantic diversity. % stereotypical assumption underpinning\nHowever, to reliably assess fairness for stereotype-free scenarios, it is essential to use varied and natural-sounding sentences. \nTo address this requirement, we develop an automated pipeline to create non-stereotypical sentence pairs.\nIllustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:overview--pipeline}, the proposed pipeline ensures greater diversity of topics by curating a collection of 500 words with minimal gender co-occurrences and, subsequently, generating sentences that incorporate these words  without implying a specific gender. %in a gender-neutral manner.\nBy employing instruction fine-tuned \\lms for sentence generation, the proposed pipeline yields realistic and semantically-diverse sentences at scale, and circumvents limitations of  template-based evaluation~\\citep{seshadri-etal-2022-templates-unreliable,selvam-etal-2023-tail-wagging}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{images/camera-ready/main/figure2.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Overview of the pipeline for generating non-stereotypical benchmarks}:  \\paperblue{1) Word selection stage} chooses seed words using a \\ac{PMI}-based score to guide sentence generation; \\paperorange{2) Sentence pairs generation stage} produces sentences for each (gender, seed word) pair, followed by the creation of the opposite gender variant, and subsequent removal of unnatural pairs or any pair containing gender co-occurring words (operationalized as $|\\mathrm{MaxPMI}(\\rvs)| \\leq \\eta$).}  \n\\label{fig:overview--pipeline}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\textbf{\\textit{Stage 1. Word Selection:}}\nTogether with predefined gender words, seed words guide sentence generation. For instance, the pair (\\tex{she}, \\tex{adolescent}) is used to indicate that a sentence should contain both words.\n\nGiven the tension between selecting truly gender-uncorrelated words (i.e., $\\delta(w) = 0$) and attaining diversity of topics and sentences, we randomly sample $500$ words from a small subset of the \\pmidiff distribution centered around 0. \nThis subset, corresponding to $\\delta(w) \\in [-0.263, 0.263]$) was determined based on the creation of 20 equal-sized bins from the empirical distribution of \\pmidiff. \nAdditionally, the authors carefully vet a sample of $300$ words (out of $21.7$k words in the bin) to ensure no strongly gender-correlated word is present.\nOur analysis reveals that the interval contains common words like \\tex{time}, \\tex{good}, and \\tex{work}, as well as less common ones like \\tex{disarrange}, \\tex{euphorically}, and \\tex{tantalizes}. \nFurthermore, since we do not only consider sampling words satisfying $\\delta(w) = 0$, we also analyse the words in the extreme words in the interval, concluding that the words are only vaguely related to gender and, therefore, can be utilized in gender-neutral contexts. \nExamples of female-skewed words are \\tex{livable}, \\tex{dormitory}, and \\tex{baths}, whereas \\tex{motivational}, \\tex{decision}, and \\tex{intellects} tend to co-occur more likely with male.\n\n\\textbf{\\textit{Stage 2. Sentence pairs generation:}}\nTogether with the gendered pronouns \\tex{he} and \\tex{she}, we incorporate the seed words into a set of gender-neutral sentences that are gender-invariant and devoid of gender co-occurring words (up to a desired value of $\\eta$).\nThis stage builds on OpenAI's ChatGPT model (\\configs{gpt-3.5-turbo-1106}) instruction-following and generative capabilities \\citep{openai2022chatgpt} to iteratively generate, filter, and refine sentences until enough grammatically and semantically sound sentences contain the desired seed words, pronouns, and are free of gender correlations. \nExperiments reported in this paper were run from August through September of 2023. \n\\emph{Sentence generation.} \nFor every seed word, ChatGPT is prompted twice, once per gendered pronoun\\footnote{We decided to invoke the model twice for each seed word as a means to ensure diversity and avoid perpetuating one-sided gender biases inherent to ChatGPT. \nAdditional experiments using the singular pronoun \\tex{they} led to ungrammatical sentences and, for that reason, were not included in this paper.}.\nThe proposed \\textit{generation} prompt steers the model towards the creation of sentences containing both seed and gendered words while keeping them gender-neutral and devoid of stereotypes. \n\n\\emph{Pair sentences and Filter unlikely pairs.} \nTo create a sentence pair from a generated sentence, we produce its minimally edited gendered version.\nWhenever possible, the minimal version is obtained by directly mapping between pronouns (e.g., \\tex{she} $\\to$ \\tex{he}, \\tex{him} $\\to$ \\tex{her}) \nHowever, in cases where directly mapping is not possible, such as the mapping of \\tex{They canceled \\placeholder{her} flight.} to its masculine variant, we prompt ChatGPT to edit the sentence.\n \nGiven a pair, the semantic filtering operation prompts ChatGPT to discriminate each sentence as \\textit{natural/likely} or \\textit{unnatural/unlikely}, and, subsequently, removes any pair with at least one \\textit{unlikely} sentence.\n\n\\emph{Part 3. Filter pairs with gender co-occurring words.} \nThe final step in the pipeline ensures the resulting sentences meet the gender co-occurrence property by filtering out sentences violating the \\maxpmi constraints.\n\n\\subsection{Fairness metrics}\n\\label{ssec:eval_metrics}\n\nIdeally, a model evaluated on non-stereotypical sentences should exhibit no bias towards either gender, especially when evaluated on datasets that impose stricter gender co-occurrence constraints.\nThis intuition is captured by two metrics: (1) the percentage of examples for which the LMs exhibits no gender preference, and (2) relative differences in model fairness when using various \\maxpmi constraints.\nFurthermore, some models may exhibit systematic preferences towards a specific gender. \nWith the goal of better understanding this behavior, we propose a third metric to quantify the gender-based preference disparity. \n\\textbf{Unstereo Score (US)} \ncaptures the intuition that, given a non-stereotypical sentence pair $\\rvs = (\\rvs_M, \\rvs_F)$ that only differs in its pronouns, fair models should exhibit preference towards neither the masculine $\\rvs_M$ nor the feminine $\\rvs_F$ version. \nFocusing on language modeling, let us define bias as the assignment of $10^\\varepsilon$ times more probability mass to one sentence over the other, represented as the log likelihood ratio: $0 \\leq |\\log \\pmodel(\\rvs_F) - \\log \\pmodel(\\rvs_M)| \\leq \\varepsilon$.\nEquation \\ref{eq:eps_fairness} incorporates the previous property into a dataset-wise metric. \nUS measures the fraction of pairs in the evaluation set $D_\\mathrm{eval}$ that are \\textit{neutral} according to model $\\pmodel$.\nUnder this fairness metric, unbiased models are expected to exhibit US scores close to 1 (or $100$\\% if reporting values in percentages) when applied to non-stereotypical datasets.\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:eps_fairness}\n\\mathrm{US}(\\pmodel, D_\\mathrm{eval}) = \\frac{1}{|D_\\mathrm{eval}|}\\sum_{(\\rvs_F, \\rvs_M) \\in |D_\\mathrm{eval}|} \\1_{|\\log \\pmodel(\\rvs_F) - \\log \\pmodel(\\rvs_M)| \\leq \\varepsilon},\n\\end{equation}\nUnlike prior works in which $ \\pmodel(\\rvs_F) = \\pmodel(\\rvs_M)$~\\citep{nangia-etal-2020-crows,nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset}, US introduces a hyperparameter \\fairthres that controls for small differences in the sentence pairs' probabilities. \nThis hyperparameter is problem-specific and can be set empirically.\nAlternatively, US can also be used to compute the \\emph{Area under the US Curve (AuFC)} which gauges the overall \\lm's fairness for various values of $\\varepsilon$. \n\n\\textbf{Fairness gap ($\\Delta_\\eta$)}\nmeasures the changes in fairness scores as we apply the constraint $|\\mathrm{MaxPMI}(\\rvs)| \\leq \\eta$ to the evaluation dataset. \nGiven the resulting dataset $D_{\\leq \\eta}$ and the original dataset $D_{\\leq \\infty}$, we report the difference in the fairness metric: $\\Delta_{\\eta} = \\mathrm{US}(\\pmodel, D_{\\leq \\eta}) - \\mathrm{US}(\\pmodel, D_{\\leq \\infty})$.\n\n\\textbf{Preferences disparity (PD)} determines the overall model's propensity to assign more than $10^\\varepsilon \\times$ probability to one of the gender groups. \nPD is reported as the percentage of female-skewed pairs minus the percentage of male-skewed pairs in the dataset.\n"

In other words, this implies that we consider a pair to be skewed if a model assigns $1.65\\times$ more probability mass to one sentence over the other. \nIn the log space, this yields $\\varepsilon = \\log 1.65 \\approx 0.217$\\footnote{\n}.\n\n"

                "\\label{sec:results}\n\n}. \nAfter reporting model fairness in the original benchmarks, we investigate the impact of $\\eta$ (level of gender co-occurrence) on the fairness measurements of \\lms.\nTo do so, we report the models' fairness gap ($\\Delta_{\\eta}$) as we reduce the $\\eta$ for each benchmark.\nWe also examine how model size affects our fairness metric. \nFinally, we study the effect of training time interventions, such as deduplicating the pretraining dataset.\n\n\\textbf{\\lms show low measurements of gender fairness even in gender-invariant benchmarks.}\nTable \\ref{tab:gender_bias__w_differences} summarizes the US fairness metric of three datasets | \\ours{5}, \\WB and \\WG (see Table \\ref{tab:fairness-gap-no-dedup-others} for results in the other benchmarks).\nAll models show low fairness values across the tested benchmarks.\nThe highest recorded values are $40.72$ and $43.92$, attributed to \\gptj on \\ours{5} ($D_{\\leq 0.65}$) benchmark and \\opts{125M} on \\WG ($D_{\\leq 0.65}$), respectively. \nDespite being the maximum values, these values are still significantly far from the ideal US score of $100$. \n\n\\textbf{Measurements of fairness are insensitive to the choice of maximum allowed gender correlation strength $\\eta$.}\nTo study the effect of the parameter of $\\eta$, which controls for the maximum allowed word-level gender-correlation, we perform our experiments using three choices of $\\eta=\\infty$ (original), $\\eta=0.80$, and  $\\eta=0.65$.\nAs previously discussed, decreases in $\\eta$ leads to an acute drop in the number of benchmark examples. For example, \\WB drops to $25.79\\%$ of its original size for the $\\eta=0.65$ (top row on Table \\ref{tab:gender_bias__w_differences}). \nThis reduction in benchmark size shows that these benchmarks include a high number of samples with gender co-occurring word language, matching our expectations (since these benchmarks study popular gender-occupations stereotypes, some of which are known to correlate strongly with gender). \nNext, we report the fairness gap between the original ($\\eta=\\infty$) and constrained versions of the benchmark ($\\Delta_{0.80}$ and $\\Delta_{0.65}$) in Table \\ref{tab:gender_bias__w_differences}. \nGiven that all models fell short in terms of fairness scores, one would expect positive $\\Delta_{.}$ values as we remove gender-correlated sentences from the evaluation set. \nBut this is not the case for the evaluated models.\nInstead, we observe marginal changes in fairness values ($|\\Delta_{0.8}| \\leq 0.81$ and $|\\Delta_{0.65}| \\leq 1.33\\%$) for \\ours{5} benchmark. \nConsidering \\WB and \\WG, changes in fairness measurements are also relatively small $\\Delta_{0.65} \\leq 6.23\\%$ and $\\Delta_{0.65} \\leq 11.84\\%$, respectively. \nThese results show that the choice of $\\eta$ is not the reason for the low measurements of fairness in \\lms. \n\n\\textbf{No effect on fairness measurements is observed with changes in model size.}\nTo examine the impact of model size on the US metric, we assess fairness across six families of LMs and various sizes but find no consistent trends in fairness metric relative to the model size (see Tables \\ref{tab:gender_bias__w_differences} and \\ref{tab:fairness-gap-no-dedup-others}).\n\n\\begin{table}[tb]\n\\caption{\\textbf{Unstereotypical fairness score across \\lms and 3 binary gender pronoun benchmarks}.

                "\\label{sec:limitations}\n\nOur work investigates the fairness of well-established LMs in non-stereotypical settings. \nWe find that even after ensuring the evaluation set is composed of sentence pairs that are not gender-correlated according to the pretraining data, models still tend to be overconfident, assigning higher probability mass to one gender  over the other.\n\nThis finding suggests that the observed behavior may not be a simple pretraining data effect and we encourage future work to investigate the reasons underlying this non-trivial behavior. \n\nA key contribution of this paper lies in proposing a new evaluation paradigm that challenges assumptions of fairness evaluation practices and creates test beds to validate them~\\citep{ribeiro-etal-2020-checklist}. \nWhen assessing models' capabilities in non-stereotypical scenarios, we expect models to be unbiased toward a specific gender.\nThe fact that models exhibit biases in this scenario raises concerns about the nature of these underlying biases.\nUnderstanding the source of these biases will be crucial to developing effective bias mitigation strategies that target both explicit (superficial) and implicit (hidden) biases~\\citep{hofmann2024dialect}. \nThrough their generations (e.g., story generation, reference letter generation), LMs hold the potential to affect the understandings, beliefs, and attitudes that people hold about particular social groups~\\citep{barocas2017problem,representharms-vs-alloca}.\nIn this work, we center our evaluation around the disproportionate representation of gendered groups irrespective of a given downstream task. \nWhile we acknowledge that our findings may not directly translate to other applications, they highlight previously overlooked biases in \\lms and offer a foundation for future studies to build upon and address these issues in more specific contexts.\nOne limitation of the current study is the focus on binary gender bias and the assessment of fairness solely using the English pronouns \\tex{she} and \\tex{he}. \nThe extent to which these findings apply to non-binary gender identities or to other demographic groups (e.g., racism, cultural) remains an open question.\nFuture research could investigate the applicability of our findings across different groups and languages, as well as expand the gender co-occurrence definition to include multiple gendered expressions.\nAnother limitation of our work is the use of a single model to construct non-stereotypical benchmarks, which may limit the diversity of the dataset and introduce model-specific artifacts.\nTo confirm the quality of the dataset, the authors have manually vetted 250 random samples from each benchmark and ran a small-scale evaluation study with 6 participants (CS researchers) of various cultural backgrounds\\footnote{The participants were asked to evaluate 100 randomly selected instances from each generated benchmarks. We found that on average $97$\\% of examples are considered neutral and that $98$\\% of the examples are considered neutral by at least 5 annotators.}. \nWe encourage future research to run more comprehensive analysis of the quality and potential artifacts introduced by constructing benchmarks with different models, such as Claude or Llama-2 \\citep{claude2024anthropic,touvron2023llama}.\n\n"

Previous studies have attributed these biases to the gendered correlations present in the training data. However, the impact of these biases in non-stereotypical settings, where the effect from training data is unclear, remains unexplored. This paper aims to address this gap by investigating whether LLMs still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical scenarios. The motivation stems from the need to understand the full extent of gender bias in LLMs, beyond the obvious stereotypes. By focusing on non-stereotypical sentence pairs, the study seeks to uncover hidden biases that may not be immediately apparent but could represent a significant blind spot in our understanding and application of these models. The significance of this research lies in its potential to reveal complex model behaviors that warrant further investigation and to highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation.

The framework then uses sentence-level correlations to produce non-stereotypical evaluation benchmarks. A sentence is considered devoid of gender co-occurring words if all its words exhibit gender correlations lower than a user-defined threshold. This constraint is used to filter out sentences from gender-invariant datasets, such as Winobias (WB) and Winogender (WG), and restrict the evaluation to a subset with minimal gender correlations.

With this in mind, we present the Pile : an 825 GiB English text corpus tar-geted at training large-scale language models. The Pile is constructed from 22 diverse high-quality subsets—both existing and newly constructed—many of which derive from academic or professional sources. Our evaluation of the untuned performance of GPT-2 and GPT-3 on the Pile shows that these models struggle on many of its components, such as academic writing. Conversely, models trained on the Pile improve signiﬁcantly over both Raw CC and CC-100 on all components of the Pile, while improving performance on downstream evaluations. Through an in-depth exploratory analysis, we document potentially concerning aspects of the data for prospective users. We make publicly available the code used in its construction. 1\n@article{gao-2021-PILE,\n    author = {Leo Gao and\nStella Biderman and\nSid Black and\nLaurence Golding and\nTravis Hoppe and\nCharles Foster and\nJason Phang and\nHorace He and\nAnish Thite and\nNoa Nabeshima and\nShawn Presser and\nConnor Leahy},\n    journal = {ArXiv preprint},\n    title = {The Pile: An 800GB Dataset of Diverse Text for Language Modeling},\n    url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027},\n    year = {2021}\n}\n\nAbstract: Much recent work in NLP has documented dataset artifacts, bias, and spurious correlations between input features and output labels. However, how to tell which features have “spurious” instead of legitimate correlations is typically left unspecified. In this work we argue that for complex language understanding tasks, all simple feature correlations are spurious, and we formalize this notion into a class of problems which we call competency problems. For example, the word “amazing” on its own should not give information about a sentiment label independent of the context in which it appears, which could include negation, metaphor, sarcasm, etc. We theoretically analyze the difficulty of creating data for competency problems when human bias is taken into account, showing that realistic datasets will increasingly deviate from competency problems as dataset size increases. This analysis gives us a simple statistical test for dataset artifacts, which we use to show more subtle biases than were described in prior work, including demonstrating that models are inappropriately affected by these less extreme biases. Our theoretical treatment of this problem also allows us to analyze proposed solutions, such as making local edits to dataset instances, and to give recommendations for future data collection and model design efforts that target competency problems.\n@inproceedings{gardner-etal-2021-competency,\n    address = {Online and Punta Cana, Dominican Republic},\n    author = {Gardner, Matt  and\nMerrill, William  and\nDodge, Jesse  and\nPeters, Matthew  and\nRoss, Alexis  and\nSingh, Sameer  and\nSmith, Noah A.},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing},\n    doi = {10.18653/v1/2021.emnlp-main.135},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    title = {Competency Problems: On Finding and Removing Artifacts in Language Data},\n    url = {https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.135},\n    year = {2021}\n}\n\n@misc{gpt-j,\n    author = {Wang, Ben and Komatsuzaki, Aran},\n    howpublished = {\\url{https://github.com/kingoflolz/mesh-transformer-jax}},\n    title = {{GPT-J-6B: A 6 Billion Parameter Autoregressive Language Model}},\n    year = {2021}\n}\n\n@misc{jiang2023mistral,\n    archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n    author = {Albert Q.

In this work, we cast auditing as an optimization problem, where we automatically search for input-output pairs that match a desired target behavior. For example, we might aim to find a non-toxic input that starts with\"Barack Obama\"that a model maps to a toxic output. This optimization problem is difficult to solve as the set of feasible points is sparse, the space is discrete, and the language models we audit are non-linear and high-dimensional. To combat these challenges, we introduce a discrete optimization algorithm, ARCA, that jointly and efficiently optimizes over inputs and outputs. Our approach automatically uncovers derogatory completions about celebrities (e.g.\"Barack Obama is a legalized unborn\"->\"child murderer\"), produces French inputs that complete to English outputs, and finds inputs that generate a specific name. Our work offers a promising new tool to uncover models' failure-modes before deployment.\n@inproceedings{jones23a-pmlr-v202,\n    author = {Jones, Erik and Dragan, Anca and Raghunathan, Aditi and Steinhardt, Jacob},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 40th International Conference on Machine Learning},\n    editor = {Krause, Andreas and Brunskill, Emma and Cho, Kyunghyun and Engelhardt, Barbara and Sabato, Sivan and Scarlett, Jonathan},\n    pdf = {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jones23a/jones23a.pdf},\n    publisher = {PMLR},\n    series = {Proceedings of Machine Learning Research},\n    title = {Automatically Auditing Large Language Models via Discrete Optimization},\n    url = {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v202/jones23a.html},\n    year = {2023}\n}\n\nAbstract: Automatic machine learning systems can inadvertently accentuate and perpetuate inappropriate human biases. Past work on examining inappropriate biases has largely focused on just individual systems. Further, there is no benchmark dataset for examining inappropriate biases in systems. Here for the first time, we present the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), which consists of 8,640 English sentences carefully chosen to tease out biases towards certain races and genders. We use the dataset to examine 219 automatic sentiment analysis systems that took part in a recent shared task, SemEval-2018 Task 1 ‘Affect in Tweets’. We find that several of the systems show statistically significant bias; that is, they consistently provide slightly higher sentiment intensity predictions for one race or one gender. We make the EEC freely available.\n@inproceedings{kiritchenko-mohammad-2018-eec,\n    address = {New Orleans, Louisiana},\n    author = {Kiritchenko, Svetlana  and\nMohammad, Saif},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the Seventh Joint Conference on Lexical and Computational Semantics},\n    doi = {10.18653/v1/S18-2005},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    title = {Examining Gender and Race Bias in Two Hundred Sentiment Analysis Systems},\n    url = {https://aclanthology.org/S18-2005},\n    year = {2018}\n}\n\n@misc{kocielnik2023biastestgpt,\n    archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n    author = {Rafal Kocielnik and Shrimai Prabhumoye and Vivian Zhang and Roy Jiang and R.

Since they are optimized to capture the statistical properties of training data, they tend to pick up on and amplify social stereotypes present in the data as well. In this study, we (1) propose a template-based method to quantify bias in BERT; (2) show that this method obtains more consistent results in capturing social biases than the traditional cosine based method; and (3) conduct a case study, evaluating gender bias in a downstream task of Gender Pronoun Resolution. Although our case study focuses on gender bias, the proposed technique is generalizable to unveiling other biases, including in multiclass settings, such as racial and religious biases.\n@inproceedings{kurita-etal-2019-measuring,\n    address = {Florence, Italy},\n    author = {Kurita, Keita  and\nVyas, Nidhi  and\nPareek, Ayush  and\nBlack, Alan W  and\nTsvetkov, Yulia},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the First Workshop on Gender Bias in Natural Language Processing},\n    doi = {10.18653/v1/W19-3823},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    title = {Measuring Bias in Contextualized Word Representations},\n    url = {https://aclanthology.org/W19-3823},\n    year = {2019}\n}\n\nAbstract: Recent works have found evidence of gender bias in models of machine translation and coreference resolution using mostly synthetic diagnostic datasets. While these quantify bias in a controlled experiment, they often do so on a small scale and consist mostly of artificial, out-of-distribution sentences. In this work, we find grammatical patterns indicating stereotypical and non-stereotypical gender-role assignments (e.g., female nurses versus male dancers) in corpora from three domains, resulting in a first large-scale gender bias dataset of 108K diverse real-world English sentences. We manually verify the quality of our corpus and use it to evaluate gender bias in various coreference resolution and machine translation models. We find that all tested models tend to over-rely on gender stereotypes when presented with natural inputs, which may be especially harmful when deployed in commercial systems. Finally, we show that our dataset lends itself to finetuning a coreference resolution model, finding it mitigates bias on a held out set. Our dataset and models are publicly available at www.github.com/SLAB-NLP/BUG. We hope they will spur future research into gender bias evaluation mitigation techniques in realistic settings.\n@inproceedings{levy-etal-2021-bug,\n    address = {Punta Cana, Dominican Republic},\n    author = {Levy, Shahar  and\nLazar, Koren  and\nStanovsky, Gabriel},\n    booktitle = {Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2021},\n    doi = {10.18653/v1/2021.findings-emnlp.211},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    title = {Collecting a Large-Scale Gender Bias Dataset for Coreference Resolution and Machine Translation},\n    url = {https://aclanthology.org/2021.findings-emnlp.211},\n    year = {2021}\n}\n\nAbstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown powerful performance and development prospects and are widely deployed in the real world. However, LLMs can capture social biases from unprocessed training data and propagate the biases to downstream tasks. Unfair LLM systems have undesirable social impacts and potential harms. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of related research on fairness in LLMs. Considering the influence of parameter magnitude and training paradigm on research strategy, we divide existing fairness research into oriented to medium-sized LLMs under pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms and oriented to large-sized LLMs under prompting paradigms. First, for medium-sized LLMs, we introduce evaluation metrics and debiasing methods from the perspectives of intrinsic bias and extrinsic bias, respectively. Then, for large-sized LLMs, we introduce recent fairness research, including fairness evaluation, reasons for bias, and debiasing methods. Finally, we discuss and provide insight on the challenges and future directions for the development of fairness in LLMs.\n@article{Li-et-al-2023-fairness-LLM-survey,\n    author = {Yingji Li and Mengnan Du and Rui Song and Xin Wang and Y.

Meanwhile, research on learning reusable text representations has begun to explore sentence-level texts, with some sentence encoders seeing enthusiastic adoption. Accordingly, we extend the Word Embedding Association Test to measure bias in sentence encoders. We then test several sentence encoders, including state-of-the-art methods such as ELMo and BERT, for the social biases studied in prior work and two important biases that are difficult or impossible to test at the word level. We observe mixed results including suspicious patterns of sensitivity that suggest the test’s assumptions may not hold in general. We conclude by proposing directions for future work on measuring bias in sentence encoders.\n@inproceedings{may-etal-2019-SEAT,\n    address = {Minneapolis, Minnesota},\n    author = {May, Chandler  and\nWang, Alex  and\nBordia, Shikha  and\nBowman, Samuel R.  and\nRudinger, Rachel},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North {A}merican Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers)},\n    doi = {10.18653/v1/N19-1063},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    title = {On Measuring Social Biases in Sentence Encoders},\n    url = {https://aclanthology.org/N19-1063},\n    year = {2019}\n}\n\n@online{MosaicML2023Introducing,\n    author = {MosaicML NLP Team},\n    note = {Accessed: 2023-05-05},\n    title = {Introducing MPT-7B: A New Standard for Open-Source,\nCommercially Usable LLMs},\n    url = {www.mosaicml.com/blog/mpt-7b},\n    urldate = {2023-05-05},\n    year = {2023}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset,\n    address = {Online},\n    author = {Nadeem, Moin  and\nBethke, Anna  and\nReddy, Siva},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers)},\n    doi = {10.18653/v1/2021.acl-long.416},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    title = {{S}tereo{S}et: Measuring stereotypical bias in pretrained language models},\n    url = {https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.416},\n    year = {2021}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{nangia-etal-2020-crows,\n    address = {Online},\n    author = {Nangia, Nikita  and\nVania, Clara  and\nBhalerao, Rasika  and\nBowman, Samuel R.},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)},\n    doi = {10.18653/v1/2020.emnlp-main.154},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    title = {{C}row{S}-Pairs: A Challenge Dataset for Measuring Social Biases in Masked Language Models},\n    url = {https://aclanthology.org/2020.emnlp-main.154},\n    year = {2020}\n}\n\nAbstract: Language models (LMs) have become ubiquitous in both NLP research and in commercial product offerings. As their commercial importance has surged, the most powerful models have become closed off, gated behind proprietary interfaces, with important details of their training data, architectures, and development undisclosed. Given the importance of these details in scientifically studying these models, including their biases and potential risks, we believe it is essential for the research community to have access to powerful, truly open LMs. To this end, we have built OLMo, a competitive, truly Open Language Model, to enable the scientific study of language models. Unlike most prior efforts that have only released model weights and inference code, we release OLMo alongside open training data and training and evaluation code. We hope this release will empower the open research community and inspire a new wave of innovation.\n@article{OLMo2024,\n    author = {Dirk Groeneveld and Iz Beltagy and Pete Walsh and Akshita Bhagia and Rodney Kinney and Oyvind Tafjord and A.

Prior work identifies harmful behaviors before deployment by using human annotators to hand-write test cases. However, human annotation is expensive, limiting the number and diversity of test cases. In this work, we automatically find cases where a target LM behaves in a harmful way, by generating test cases (“red teaming”) using another LM. We evaluate the target LM’s replies to generated test questions using a classifier trained to detect offensive content, uncovering tens of thousands of offensive replies in a 280B parameter LM chatbot. We explore several methods, from zero-shot generation to reinforcement learning, for generating test cases with varying levels of diversity and difficulty. Furthermore, we use prompt engineering to control LM-generated test cases to uncover a variety of other harms, automatically finding groups of people that the chatbot discusses in offensive ways, personal and hospital phone numbers generated as the chatbot’s own contact info, leakage of private training data in generated text, and harms that occur over the course of a conversation. Overall, LM-based red teaming is one promising tool (among many needed) for finding and fixing diverse, undesirable LM behaviors before impacting users.\n@inproceedings{perez-etal-2022-red-team-anthropic,\n    address = {Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates},\n    author = {Perez, Ethan  and\nHuang, Saffron  and\nSong, Francis  and\nCai, Trevor  and\nRing, Roman  and\nAslanides, John  and\nGlaese, Amelia  and\nMcAleese, Nat  and\nIrving, Geoffrey},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    title = {Red Teaming Language Models with Language Models},\n    url = {https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-main.225},\n    year = {2022}\n}\n\nAbstract: As language models (LMs) scale, they develop many novel behaviors, good and bad, exacerbating the need to evaluate how they behave.

While societal biases and stereotypes have been extensively researched in various NLP applications, there is a surprising gap for emotion analysis. However, emotion and gender are closely linked in societal discourse. E.g., women are often thought of as more empathetic, while men's anger is more socially accepted. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study of gendered emotion attribution in five state-of-the-art LLMs (open- and closed-source). We investigate whether emotions are gendered, and whether these variations are based on societal stereotypes. We prompt the models to adopt a gendered persona and attribute emotions to an event like 'When I had a serious argument with a dear person'. We then analyze the emotions generated by the models in relation to the gender-event pairs. We find that all models consistently exhibit gendered emotions, influenced by gender stereotypes. These findings are in line with established research in psychology and gender studies. Our study sheds light on the complex societal interplay between language, gender, and emotion. The reproduction of emotion stereotypes in LLMs allows us to use those models to study the topic in detail, but raises questions about the predictive use of those same LLMs for emotion applications.\n@misc{plazadelarco2024angrymensadwomen,\n    archiveprefix = {arXiv},\n    author = {Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco and Amanda Cercas Curry and Alba Curry and Gavin Abercrombie and Dirk Hovy},\n    eprint = {2403.03121},\n    primaryclass = {cs.CL},\n    title = {Angry Men, Sad Women: Large Language Models Reflect Gendered Stereotypes in Emotion Attribution},\n    year = {2024}\n}\n\nAbstract: ,\n@inproceedings{razeghi-etal-2022-impact,\n    address = {Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates},\n    author = {Razeghi, Yasaman  and\nLogan IV, Robert L  and\nGardner, Matt  and\nSingh, Sameer},\n    booktitle = {Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2022},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    title = {Impact of Pretraining Term Frequencies on Few-Shot Numerical Reasoning},\n    url = {https://aclanthology.org/2022.findings-emnlp.59},\n    year = {2022}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{razeghi-etal-2022-snoopy,\n    address = {Abu Dhabi, UAE},\n    author = {Razeghi, Yasaman  and\nMekala, Raja Sekhar Reddy  and\nLogan Iv, Robert L  and\nGardner, Matt  and\nSingh, Sameer},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2022 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: System Demonstrations},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    title = {Snoopy: An Online Interface for Exploring the Effect of Pretraining Term Frequencies on Few-Shot {LM} Performance},\n    url = {https://aclanthology.org/2022.emnlp-demos.39},\n    year = {2022}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{ribeiro-etal-2020-checklist,\n    address = {Online},\n    author = {Ribeiro, Marco Tulio  and\nWu, Tongshuang  and\nGuestrin, Carlos  and\nSingh, Sameer},\n    booktitle = {Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    doi = {10.18653/v1/2020.acl-main.442},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    title = {Beyond Accuracy: Behavioral Testing of {NLP} Models with {C}heck{L}ist},\n    url = {https://aclanthology.org/2020.acl-main.442},\n    year = {2020}\n}\n\nAbstract: We present an empirical study of gender bias in coreference resolution systems.

However, the presence and effect of such correlations are typically examined feature by feature. We investigate the cumulative impact on a model of many such intersecting features. Using a new statistical method, we examine whether such spurious patterns in data appear in models trained on the data. We select two tasks -- natural language inference and duplicate-question detection -- for which any unigram feature on its own should ideally be uninformative, which gives us a large pool of automatically extracted features with which to experiment. The large size of this pool allows us to investigate the intersection of features spuriously associated with (potentially different) labels. We then apply an optimization approach to *reweight* the training data, reducing thousands of spurious correlations, and examine how doing so affects models trained on the reweighted data. Surprisingly, though this method can successfully reduce lexical biases in the training data, we still find strong evidence of corresponding bias in the trained models, including worsened bias for slightly more complex features (bigrams). We close with discussion about the implications of our results on what it means to\"debias\"training data, and how issues of data quality can affect model bias.\n@inproceedings{serrano-etal-2023-stubborn,\n    address = {Toronto, Canada},\n    author = {Serrano, Sofia  and\nDodge, Jesse  and\nSmith, Noah A.},\n    booktitle = {Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: ACL 2023},\n    doi = {10.18653/v1/2023.findings-acl.516},\n    publisher = {Association for Computational Linguistics},\n    title = {Stubborn Lexical Bias in Data and Models},\n    url = {https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-acl.516},\n    year = {2023}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{seshadri-etal-2022-templates-unreliable,\n    author = {Preethi Seshadri and Pouya Pezeshkpour and Sameer Singh},\n    booktitle = {TSRML Workshop The above content represents the relevant literature in this field.

Previous studies have attributed these biases to the gendered correlations present in the training data. However, the impact of these biases in non-stereotypical settings, where the effect from training data is unclear, remains unexplored. This paper aims to address this gap by investigating whether LLMs still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical scenarios. The motivation stems from the need to understand the full extent of gender bias in LLMs, beyond the obvious stereotypes. By focusing on non-stereotypical sentence pairs, the study seeks to uncover hidden biases that may not be immediately apparent but could represent a significant blind spot in our understanding and application of these models. The significance of this research lies in its potential to reveal complex model behaviors that warrant further investigation and to highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation. This will contribute to advancing our understanding of model behavior and ensuring the responsible use of LLMs.\n\n## Main Idea\n\nThe paper introduces UnStereoEval (USE), a novel evaluation framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios. USE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contains minimal word-gender associations. The framework systematically benchmarks the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios by leveraging USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language. The study finds low fairness across all tested models, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words.

In this paper, we focus on bias where the effect from training data is unclear, and instead address the question: \\textit{Do language models still exhibit gender bias in non-stereotypical settings?}\nTo do so, we introduce \\textbf{UnStereoEval} (USE), a novel framework tailored for investigating gender bias in stereotype-free scenarios.\nUSE defines a sentence-level score based on pretraining data statistics to determine if the sentence contain minimal word-gender associations.\nTo systematically benchmark the fairness of popular language models in stereotype-free scenarios, we utilize USE to automatically generate benchmarks without any gender-related language. \nBy leveraging USE's sentence-level score, we also repurpose prior gender bias benchmarks (Winobias and Winogender) for non-stereotypical evaluation.\nSurprisingly, we find low fairness across all $28$ tested models. \nConcretely, models demonstrate fair behavior in only $9\\%$-$41\\%$ of  stereotype-free sentences, suggesting that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words.\nThese results raise important questions about where underlying model biases come from and highlight the need for more systematic and comprehensive bias evaluation.\nWe release the full dataset and code at \\url{https://ucinlp.io/unstereo-eval}.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\n\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nThe widespread adoption of \\lms raises concerns about potential encoded biases and their risks for marginalized populations~\\citep{stochasticparrots,Bommasani2021FoundationModels}. \nIn an attempt to track and gauge prejudices in \\lms, evaluation practices have been augmented with various fairness benchmarks~\\citep{zhao-etal-2018-winobias,rudinger-etal-2018-winogender,nangia-etal-2020-crows,nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset,smith-etal-2022-holisticbias}. \nThe incorporation of such testbeds has enabled the detection of numerous undesirable harms and stereotypes within existing \\lms,\nincluding occupation and emotion stereotypes~\\citep{wang2024decodingtrust,plazadelarco2024angrymensadwomen}.\n\nAn underlying assumption in prior research is that \\lms perpetuate biases by leveraging gender correlations present in the pretraining data.\nConsidering the widespread deployment of these models in diverse open-ended generation scenarios, it is also crucial to contemplate the possibility of societal biases manifesting in non-stereotypical sentences.\nSuch biases, which might not be immediately apparent, could represent a significant blind spot in our current understanding and application of these models. \nThese ideas lead to an important yet unaddressed question: \\textit{how do \\lms behave in non-stereotypical settings}? \n\nTo address this question, we introduce \\textbf{\\textit{UnStereoEval}}, a novel evaluation framework explicitly focusing on stereotype-free scenarios. \nLeveraging gendered pronouns\\footnote{While we recognize the complexity of gender and its diverse expressions, this paper focuses on the binary gender expression constituting the male and female groups and uses English binary pronouns \\tex{he}/\\tex{his}/\\tex{him} and \\tex{she}/\\tex{her} to refer to individuals within each group.},  \n\\textit{UnStereoEval} determines whether models remain fair when presented with \\textit{non-stereotypical} sentence pairs. \nWe define non-stereotypical sentence pairs as:\n(1) \\textit{gender-invariant}, i.e., remain semantically and grammatically correct regardless of the gendered version of the sentence in the pair; and \n(2) free of \\textit{gender co-occurring words}, i.e., there are no words in the sentence that, according to the pretraining corpora, correlate strongly with one specific gender.\nThe magnitude of gender co-occurrence is determined in terms of \\lms pretraining data word frequency statistics.\nFigure \\ref{fig:neutral_examples} shows three examples of sentence pairs satisfying the two previous properties.\nIdeally, since \\lms are trained to learn the distribution of the pretraining corpora, models should not display gender skews for non-stereotypical sentence pairs, such as \\tex{We appreciate that \\placeholder{pronoun}'s here.}.\nHowever, as shown in Figure \\ref{fig:neutral_examples}, $22$ out of $28$ tested \\lms do exhibit preferences for the sentence with the male pronoun. \n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{images/camera-ready/main/figure.png}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Preferences of 28 \\lms for three non-stereotypical sentence pairs}. Despite being grammatically and semantically correct under both \\paperblue{masculine ($s_M$)}  and \\paperorange{feminine ($s_F$)} completions and free of words with strong gender connotations, the majority of \\lms assigns more probability mass to one completion over the other.}\n\\label{fig:neutral_examples}\n\\end{figure}\n\nTo systematically evaluate the models in non-stereotypical settings, we develop a pipeline to automatically create gender-invariant evaluation sentence pairs without gender-correlated words. \nUsing this pipeline, we create benchmarks with diverse syntactic and semantic structures.\nAdditionally, we utilize \\textit{UnStereoEval} to repurpose two commonly used fairness benchmarks whose sentences are already gender-invariant | \\WB and \\WG \\citep{zhao-etal-2018-winobias,rudinger-etal-2018-winogender}. \nIn particular, we limit the gender-related language in them by excluding sentences containing gender co-occurring words.\nWe evaluate the fairness of 28 \\lms, including \\llama, Mistral, and OLMo, across all benchmarks. \nFairness is quantified as the percentage of instances where a model displays no gender preference.\nAcross all benchmarks, models exhibit low fairness, with values between $9\\%$ to $41\\%$.\nMoreover, we find that models consistently favor male sentences in \\WB and \\WG.\nOur results indicate alarming levels of gender bias in \\lms for sentences without stereotypes. %gender-related language.\n\nBy showing that \\textbf{\\lms exhibit concerning skews when tested in stereotype-free scenarios}, our work emphasizes the presence of complex model behaviors that warrant further investigation. \nAs we observe the widespread deployment of \\lms, it is imperative to develop more exhaustive evaluation testbeds that encompass both stereotype and stereotype-free benchmarks. \nThis will be essential for advancing our understanding of model behavior and ensuring the responsible use of \\lms.\n\n\n\\section{UnStereoEval}\n\n\\label{sec:methodology}\n\nThis section introduces \\textbf{UnStereoEval}, an evaluation framework specifically tailored for assessing \\lms' fairness in non-stereotypical gender scenarios. \nWe begin by describing how we measure word- and sentence-level gender correlations. \nSubsequently, we show how to use sentence-level correlations to produce non-stereotypical evaluation benchmarks.\nFinally, we define the fairness metrics that we use in this paper.\n\n\\subsection{Gender co-occurring words}\n\\label{ssec:pmi}\n\nWord-gender correlations are determined empirically using word co-occurrence statistics from \\PILE~-- a high-quality and publicly available pretraining set used to train popular \\lms~\\citep{gao-2021-PILE}.\nAfter tokenizing and removing stopwords, both word and word co-occurrence counts are collected over windows of size 10 that are swept over all the pretraining text in \\PILE~\\citep{razeghi-etal-2022-snoopy}.\nOne method to determine word-gender co-occurrences using word statistics is through \\ac{PMI}, defined as $\\mathrm{PMI}(w, g) = \\log \\frac{\\pdata(w, g)}{\\pdata(w)\\pdata(g)}$.\nSpecifically, for a corpus $D$, \\ac{PMI} estimates how much more likely a word $w$ (e.g., \\tex{vacations}) is to co-occur with a gendered word $g$ (e.g., \\tex{she}) than would be expected by random chance.\n\nTo determine whether a word is more likely to correlate with one gender, we propose the PMI-based score \\pmidiff defined in Equation \\ref{eq:pmi-diff-heshe}. \nNote that, similarly to previous literature~\\citep{Bolukbasi2016}, we use the pronouns \\tex{he} and \\tex{she} to represent gendered groups\\footnote{Throughout the paper, we use \\pmidiff to quantify word-level gender correlations.}. \nPositive \\pmidiff values imply stronger correlations between the words and the female group, whilst negative values imply stronger correlations with the male group.\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:pmi-diff-heshe}\n\\delta(w) = \\mathrm{PMI}(w, \\text{'she'}) - \\mathrm{PMI}(w, \\text{'he'}),\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsection{Enforcing minimal gender co-occurrences}\n\\label{ssec:pmi-constraints}\n\nTo evaluate LMs in non-stereotypical scenarios, we use sentence pairs that have minimal gender correlations.\nThe gender correlation of a sentence can be measured by combining the $|\\rvs|$ word-level scores in the sentence $\\rvs = w_1 w_2 ... w_{|\\rvs|}$ into a single score.\nThere are many ways of combining word-level scores, including  averaging word-level scores or computing the fraction of words exhibiting small gender correlations.\nIn this work, we build upon existing research on the impact of individual words on LM behavior~\\citep{gardner-etal-2021-competency} and quantify the sentence-level gender correlations in terms of a single most prominent gender co-occurring word score in the pair (see Equation \\ref{eq:max-gender-pmi}).\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{eq:max-gender-pmi}\n\\mathrm{MaxPMI}(\\rvs) = \\argmax_{\\delta' \\in \\{\\delta(w_1),...,\\delta(w_{|\\rvs|})\\}} |\\delta'|\n\\end{align}\n\\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\\textwidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{images/camera-ready/results/lineplot__datasetpct_vs_maxpmi.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Percentage of examples remaining after enforcing gender co-occurrences across 5 datasets} (i.e., $|\\mathrm{MaxPMI}(\\rvs)| \\leq \\eta$). When $\\eta=0.5$, three datasets preserve less than $35\\%$ of its original sentences.}\n    \\label{fig:num-sentences-by-max-pmi-epsilon}\n\\end{wrapfigure}\nUsing the previous definition, a sentence $\\rvs$ is said to be devoid of gender co-occurring words if all its words exhibit gender correlations lower than a user-defined threshold $\\eta$, i.e., if $|\\mathrm{MaxPMI}(\\rvs)| \\leq \\eta$ is satisfied. \nThis constraint can then be used to filter out sentences of gender-invariant datasets, such as Winobias (\\WB) or Winogender (\\WG), and, thus, restrict the evaluation to a subset with minimal gender correlations. \nDespite leading to less stereotypical datasets, lower values of $\\eta$ may also lead to considerably smaller datasets (see Figure \\ref{fig:num-sentences-by-max-pmi-epsilon}). \nAs observed, the reduction in size is larger when applying the constraints to stereotypical datasets, like \\WB and \\WG, since they are created to surface stereotypical biases (e.g., gender-occupation, gender-emotion) known to be pervasive in training datasets.\n\\subsection{Benchmark construction}\n\\label{ssec:benchmark}\n\nThe focus on stereotypes in popular fairness benchmarks makes it impractical to enforce gender co-occurrence constraints, often leading to substantially smaller datasets with limited syntactic and semantic diversity. % stereotypical assumption underpinning\nHowever, to reliably assess fairness for stereotype-free scenarios, it is essential to use varied and natural-sounding sentences. \nTo address this requirement, we develop an automated pipeline to create non-stereotypical sentence pairs.\nIllustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:overview--pipeline}, the proposed pipeline ensures greater diversity of topics by curating a collection of 500 words with minimal gender co-occurrences and, subsequently, generating sentences that incorporate these words  without implying a specific gender. %in a gender-neutral manner.\nBy employing instruction fine-tuned \\lms for sentence generation, the proposed pipeline yields realistic and semantically-diverse sentences at scale, and circumvents limitations of  template-based evaluation~\\citep{seshadri-etal-2022-templates-unreliable,selvam-etal-2023-tail-wagging}.\n\n\\begin{figure}[tb]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{images/camera-ready/main/figure2.pdf}\n\\end{center}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Overview of the pipeline for generating non-stereotypical benchmarks}:  \\paperblue{1) Word selection stage} chooses seed words using a \\ac{PMI}-based score to guide sentence generation; \\paperorange{2) Sentence pairs generation stage} produces sentences for each (gender, seed word) pair, followed by the creation of the opposite gender variant, and subsequent removal of unnatural pairs or any pair containing gender co-occurring words (operationalized as $|\\mathrm{MaxPMI}(\\rvs)| \\leq \\eta$).}  \n\\label{fig:overview--pipeline}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\textbf{\\textit{Stage 1. Word Selection:}}\nTogether with predefined gender words, seed words guide sentence generation. For instance, the pair (\\tex{she}, \\tex{adolescent}) is used to indicate that a sentence should contain both words.\n\nGiven the tension between selecting truly gender-uncorrelated words (i.e., $\\delta(w) = 0$) and attaining diversity of topics and sentences, we randomly sample $500$ words from a small subset of the \\pmidiff distribution centered around 0. \nThis subset, corresponding to $\\delta(w) \\in [-0.263, 0.263]$) was determined based on the creation of 20 equal-sized bins from the empirical distribution of \\pmidiff. \nAdditionally, the authors carefully vet a sample of $300$ words (out of $21.7$k words in the bin) to ensure no strongly gender-correlated word is present.\nOur analysis reveals that the interval contains common words like \\tex{time}, \\tex{good}, and \\tex{work}, as well as less common ones like \\tex{disarrange}, \\tex{euphorically}, and \\tex{tantalizes}. \nFurthermore, since we do not only consider sampling words satisfying $\\delta(w) = 0$, we also analyse the words in the extreme words in the interval, concluding that the words are only vaguely related to gender and, therefore, can be utilized in gender-neutral contexts. \nExamples of female-skewed words are \\tex{livable}, \\tex{dormitory}, and \\tex{baths}, whereas \\tex{motivational}, \\tex{decision}, and \\tex{intellects} tend to co-occur more likely with male.\n\n\\textbf{\\textit{Stage 2. Sentence pairs generation:}}\nTogether with the gendered pronouns \\tex{he} and \\tex{she}, we incorporate the seed words into a set of gender-neutral sentences that are gender-invariant and devoid of gender co-occurring words (up to a desired value of $\\eta$).\nThis stage builds on OpenAI's ChatGPT model (\\configs{gpt-3.5-turbo-1106}) instruction-following and generative capabilities \\citep{openai2022chatgpt} to iteratively generate, filter, and refine sentences until enough grammatically and semantically sound sentences contain the desired seed words, pronouns, and are free of gender correlations. \nExperiments reported in this paper were run from August through September of 2023. \n\\emph{Sentence generation.} \nFor every seed word, ChatGPT is prompted twice, once per gendered pronoun\\footnote{We decided to invoke the model twice for each seed word as a means to ensure diversity and avoid perpetuating one-sided gender biases inherent to ChatGPT. \nAdditional experiments using the singular pronoun \\tex{they} led to ungrammatical sentences and, for that reason, were not included in this paper.}.\nThe proposed \\textit{generation} prompt steers the model towards the creation of sentences containing both seed and gendered words while keeping them gender-neutral and devoid of stereotypes. \n\n\\emph{Pair sentences and Filter unlikely pairs.} \nTo create a sentence pair from a generated sentence, we produce its minimally edited gendered version.\nWhenever possible, the minimal version is obtained by directly mapping between pronouns (e.g., \\tex{she} $\\to$ \\tex{he}, \\tex{him} $\\to$ \\tex{her}) \nHowever, in cases where directly mapping is not possible, such as the mapping of \\tex{They canceled \\placeholder{her} flight.} to its masculine variant, we prompt ChatGPT to edit the sentence.\n \nGiven a pair, the semantic filtering operation prompts ChatGPT to discriminate each sentence as \\textit{natural/likely} or \\textit{unnatural/unlikely}, and, subsequently, removes any pair with at least one \\textit{unlikely} sentence.\n\n\\emph{Part 3. Filter pairs with gender co-occurring words.} \nThe final step in the pipeline ensures the resulting sentences meet the gender co-occurrence property by filtering out sentences violating the \\maxpmi constraints.\n\n\\subsection{Fairness metrics}\n\\label{ssec:eval_metrics}\n\nIdeally, a model evaluated on non-stereotypical sentences should exhibit no bias towards either gender, especially when evaluated on datasets that impose stricter gender co-occurrence constraints.\nThis intuition is captured by two metrics: (1) the percentage of examples for which the LMs exhibits no gender preference, and (2) relative differences in model fairness when using various \\maxpmi constraints.\nFurthermore, some models may exhibit systematic preferences towards a specific gender. \nWith the goal of better understanding this behavior, we propose a third metric to quantify the gender-based preference disparity. \n\\textbf{Unstereo Score (US)} \ncaptures the intuition that, given a non-stereotypical sentence pair $\\rvs = (\\rvs_M, \\rvs_F)$ that only differs in its pronouns, fair models should exhibit preference towards neither the masculine $\\rvs_M$ nor the feminine $\\rvs_F$ version. \nFocusing on language modeling, let us define bias as the assignment of $10^\\varepsilon$ times more probability mass to one sentence over the other, represented as the log likelihood ratio: $0 \\leq |\\log \\pmodel(\\rvs_F) - \\log \\pmodel(\\rvs_M)| \\leq \\varepsilon$.\nEquation \\ref{eq:eps_fairness} incorporates the previous property into a dataset-wise metric. \nUS measures the fraction of pairs in the evaluation set $D_\\mathrm{eval}$ that are \\textit{neutral} according to model $\\pmodel$.\nUnder this fairness metric, unbiased models are expected to exhibit US scores close to 1 (or $100$\\% if reporting values in percentages) when applied to non-stereotypical datasets.\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq:eps_fairness}\n\\mathrm{US}(\\pmodel, D_\\mathrm{eval}) = \\frac{1}{|D_\\mathrm{eval}|}\\sum_{(\\rvs_F, \\rvs_M) \\in |D_\\mathrm{eval}|} \\1_{|\\log \\pmodel(\\rvs_F) - \\log \\pmodel(\\rvs_M)| \\leq \\varepsilon},\n\\end{equation}\nUnlike prior works in which $ \\pmodel(\\rvs_F) = \\pmodel(\\rvs_M)$~\\citep{nangia-etal-2020-crows,nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset}, US introduces a hyperparameter \\fairthres that controls for small differences in the sentence pairs' probabilities. \nThis hyperparameter is problem-specific and can be set empirically.\nAlternatively, US can also be used to compute the \\emph{Area under the US Curve (AuFC)} which gauges the overall \\lm's fairness for various values of $\\varepsilon$. \n\n\\textbf{Fairness gap ($\\Delta_\\eta$)}\nmeasures the changes in fairness scores as we apply the constraint $|\\mathrm{MaxPMI}(\\rvs)| \\leq \\eta$ to the evaluation dataset. \nGiven the resulting dataset $D_{\\leq \\eta}$ and the original dataset $D_{\\leq \\infty}$, we report the difference in the fairness metric: $\\Delta_{\\eta} = \\mathrm{US}(\\pmodel, D_{\\leq \\eta}) - \\mathrm{US}(\\pmodel, D_{\\leq \\infty})$.\n\n\\textbf{Preferences disparity (PD)} determines the overall model's propensity to assign more than $10^\\varepsilon \\times$ probability to one of the gender groups. \nPD is reported as the percentage of female-skewed pairs minus the percentage of male-skewed pairs in the dataset.\n\n\n```\n\n## Experimental Setup\n\n```json\n[{\"name\": \"UnStereoEval Framework\", \"description\": \"The UnStereoEval (USE) framework is designed to assess the fairness of language models in non-stereotypical gender scenarios.

In other words, this implies that we consider a pair to be skewed if a model assigns $1.65\\times$ more probability mass to one sentence over the other. \nIn the log space, this yields $\\varepsilon = \\log 1.65 \\approx 0.217$\\footnote{\n}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Results}\n\n\\label{sec:results}\n\n}. \nAfter reporting model fairness in the original benchmarks, we investigate the impact of $\\eta$ (level of gender co-occurrence) on the fairness measurements of \\lms.\nTo do so, we report the models' fairness gap ($\\Delta_{\\eta}$) as we reduce the $\\eta$ for each benchmark.\nWe also examine how model size affects our fairness metric. \nFinally, we study the effect of training time interventions, such as deduplicating the pretraining dataset.\n\n\\textbf{\\lms show low measurements of gender fairness even in gender-invariant benchmarks.}\nTable \\ref{tab:gender_bias__w_differences} summarizes the US fairness metric of three datasets | \\ours{5}, \\WB and \\WG (see Table \\ref{tab:fairness-gap-no-dedup-others} for results in the other benchmarks).\nAll models show low fairness values across the tested benchmarks.\nThe highest recorded values are $40.72$ and $43.92$, attributed to \\gptj on \\ours{5} ($D_{\\leq 0.65}$) benchmark and \\opts{125M} on \\WG ($D_{\\leq 0.65}$), respectively. \nDespite being the maximum values, these values are still significantly far from the ideal US score of $100$. \n\n\\textbf{Measurements of fairness are insensitive to the choice of maximum allowed gender correlation strength $\\eta$.}\nTo study the effect of the parameter of $\\eta$, which controls for the maximum allowed word-level gender-correlation, we perform our experiments using three choices of $\\eta=\\infty$ (original), $\\eta=0.80$, and  $\\eta=0.65$.\nAs previously discussed, decreases in $\\eta$ leads to an acute drop in the number of benchmark examples. For example, \\WB drops to $25.79\\%$ of its original size for the $\\eta=0.65$ (top row on Table \\ref{tab:gender_bias__w_differences}). \nThis reduction in benchmark size shows that these benchmarks include a high number of samples with gender co-occurring word language, matching our expectations (since these benchmarks study popular gender-occupations stereotypes, some of which are known to correlate strongly with gender). \nNext, we report the fairness gap between the original ($\\eta=\\infty$) and constrained versions of the benchmark ($\\Delta_{0.80}$ and $\\Delta_{0.65}$) in Table \\ref{tab:gender_bias__w_differences}. \nGiven that all models fell short in terms of fairness scores, one would expect positive $\\Delta_{.}$ values as we remove gender-correlated sentences from the evaluation set. \nBut this is not the case for the evaluated models.\nInstead, we observe marginal changes in fairness values ($|\\Delta_{0.8}| \\leq 0.81$ and $|\\Delta_{0.65}| \\leq 1.33\\%$) for \\ours{5} benchmark. \nConsidering \\WB and \\WG, changes in fairness measurements are also relatively small $\\Delta_{0.65} \\leq 6.23\\%$ and $\\Delta_{0.65} \\leq 11.84\\%$, respectively. \nThese results show that the choice of $\\eta$ is not the reason for the low measurements of fairness in \\lms. \n\n\\textbf{No effect on fairness measurements is observed with changes in model size.}\nTo examine the impact of model size on the US metric, we assess fairness across six families of LMs and various sizes but find no consistent trends in fairness metric relative to the model size (see Tables \\ref{tab:gender_bias__w_differences} and \\ref{tab:fairness-gap-no-dedup-others}).\n\n\\begin{table}[tb]\n\\caption{\\textbf{Unstereotypical fairness score across \\lms and 3 binary gender pronoun benchmarks}.

pretraining data improve the model fairness?}} \nTo answer this question, we use \\pyth models that are trained on deduplicated training data \\citep{biderman2023pythia} and measure their fairness score. \nTable \\ref{tab:gender_bias__impact_orig__dedup} reports the difference in fairness scores between the original and deduplicated \\pyth models.\nOverall, we do not observe a consistent trend

comprehensive discussion on fairness in LMs, consult surveys by \\citet{gallegos2023-fairness-LLM-survey} and \\citet{Li-et-al-2023-fairness-LLM-survey}.\n\\textbf{Auditing fairness of \\lms.}\nPrevious research on auditing fairness in \\lms utilizes a limited small-scale hand-curated list of sentence pairs, often designated templates (\\cite{kiritchenko-mohammad-2018-eec,rudinger-etal-2018-winogender,may-etal-2019-SEAT,kurita-etal-2019-measuring}, \\textit{inter alia}). \nThe deficiency in lexical and semantic diversity~\\citep{seshadri-etal-2022-templates-unreliable,selvam-etal-2023-tail-wagging}, as well as the unnaturalness of manually constructed templates~\\citep{levy-etal-2021-bug}, prompted researchers to adopt new evaluation practices. \nThese practices include extracting sentences from established datasets ~\\citep{levy-etal-2021-bug}, sourcing these sentences through crowd-sourcing efforts ~\\citep{nadeem-etal-2021-stereoset, nangia-etal-2020-crows} or through \\lms generation~\\citep{kocielnik2023biastestgpt}.\n\n\\textbf{Model-based benchmark generation.}\nThe use of models to assist in model evaluation is not a novel concept \\citep{perez-etal-2023-discovering,perez-etal-2022-red-team-anthropic,bai2023fairbench}. \nA common trend in past work is the focus on finding wrongful behaviors in \\lms by exploiting known weaknesses of \\lms, such as known stereotypes and failure modes. \nBy controlling for non-stereotypical scenarios, i.e., situations with no explicit gendered associations (according to the pretraining data), our work instead sets out to validate the implicit assumption that the models are unbiased when stereotypes are not present. \n\n\\textbf{Pretraining data and model behavior.}\nCurrent practices for developing \\lms require large scale Internet-based datasets for training which are difficult to understand \\citep{stochasticparrots}.\nHowever, \\lms capture unintended dataset artifacts or biases in the training data \\citep{razeghi-etal-2022-impact, elazar2022measuring,gardner-etal-2021-competency,serrano-etal-2023-stubborn}\nOur work utilizes insights from previous research to curate a dataset that is free of prominent gender correlations. \nBy ensuring the evaluation dataset is devoid of these strong  correlations at a sentence level, we expect an unbiased model to manifest no preferences towards gender.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion \\& Limitations}\n\n\\label{sec:limitations}\n\nOur work investigates the fairness of well-established LMs in non-stereotypical settings. \nWe find that even after ensuring the evaluation set is composed of sentence pairs that are not gender-correlated according to the pretraining data, models still tend to be overconfident, assigning higher probability mass to one gender  over the other.\n\nThis finding suggests that the observed behavior may not be a simple pretraining data effect and we encourage future work to investigate the reasons underlying this non-trivial behavior. \n\nA key contribution of this paper lies in proposing a new evaluation paradigm that challenges assumptions of fairness evaluation practices and creates test beds to validate them~\\citep{ribeiro-etal-2020-checklist}. \nWhen assessing models' capabilities in non-stereotypical scenarios, we expect models to be unbiased toward a specific gender.\nThe fact that models exhibit biases in this scenario raises concerns about the nature of these underlying biases.\nUnderstanding the source of these biases will be crucial to developing effective bias mitigation strategies that target both explicit (superficial) and implicit (hidden) biases~\\citep{hofmann2024dialect}. \nThrough their generations (e.g., story generation, reference letter generation), LMs hold the potential to affect the understandings, beliefs, and attitudes that people hold about particular social groups~\\citep{barocas2017problem,representharms-vs-alloca}.\nIn this work, we center our evaluation around the disproportionate representation of gendered groups irrespective of a given downstream task. \nWhile we acknowledge that our findings may not directly translate to other applications, they highlight previously overlooked biases in \\lms and offer a foundation for future studies to build upon and address these issues in more specific contexts.\nOne limitation of the current study is the focus on binary gender bias and the assessment of fairness solely using the English pronouns \\tex{she} and \\tex{he}. \nThe extent to which these findings apply to non-binary gender identities or to other demographic groups (e.g., racism, cultural) remains an open question.\nFuture research could investigate the applicability of our findings across different groups and languages, as well as expand the gender co-occurrence definition to include multiple gendered expressions.\nAnother limitation of our work is the use of a single model to construct non-stereotypical benchmarks, which may limit the diversity of the dataset and introduce model-specific artifacts.\nTo confirm the quality of the dataset, the authors have manually vetted 250 random samples from each benchmark and ran a small-scale evaluation study with 6 participants (CS researchers) of various cultural backgrounds\\footnote{The participants were asked to evaluate 100 randomly selected instances from each generated benchmarks. We found that on average $97$\\% of examples are considered neutral and that $98$\\% of the examples are considered neutral by at least 5 annotators.}. \nWe encourage future research to run more comprehensive analysis of the quality and potential artifacts introduced by constructing benchmarks with different models, such as Claude or Llama-2 \\citep{claude2024anthropic,touvron2023llama}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\n\\label{sec:conclusion}\n\nWith the increased use of \\lms for diverse content-generation tasks (e.g., assistive-writing, automatic summarization), it is imperative gain a comprehensive understanding of model behavior and potential implications.\nUnlike previous works that attempt to surface prejudices in \\lms by exploiting underlying gendered correlations in the training data, our work tests the fairness of 28 \\lms in \\textit{non-stereotypical} evaluation sets that are devoid of such correlations.\nOur results show that all models exhibit gender biases when evaluated using stereotype-free sentences, and that all models systematically favor male completions over female completions in the non-stereotypical portion of \\WB and \\WG. \nThese findings demonstrate that bias does not solely stem from the presence of gender-related words in sentences and warrants further investigation to understand the nature of the surfaced behaviors. \nBeing cognizant of \\lm's biases in innocuous scenarios should be an integral part of future evaluation practices, as it promotes a better understanding of complex behaviors within models and constitutes additional safety checks towards the perpetuation of unintended harms.\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Reproducibility Statement}\n\\label{sec:reproducibility}\n\nOur experiments are based on OpenAI ChatGPT (\\configs{gpt-3.5-turbo}, version available as of September 2023) API\\footnote{\\url{https://platform.openai.\n \n\nFinally, to facilitate future research, we release the full dataset, code, and demo at \\url{https://ucinlp.io/unstereo-eval}.\n\n\n\\subsubsection*{Acknowledgments}\nThe authors would like to thank all the reviewers, the members from the UCI-NLP and DataLab at UC Irvine and Yanai Elazar for the provided feedback and insightful discussions regarding this project.\nThis material is based upon work sponsored in part by NSF IIS-2040989, NSF IIS-2046873, the DARPA MCS program under Contract No. N660011924033 with the United States Office Of Naval Research, and, finally, by Hasso Plattner Institute (HPI) through the UCI-HPI fellowship.\nThe views expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not reflect the policy of the funding agencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n"

Motivated by critical applications where the learned model is deployed to make predictions about people from a rich collection of overlapping subpopulations, we initiate the study of \\emph{multigroup robust} algorithms whose robustness guarantees for each subpopulation only degrade with the amount of data corruption \\emph{inside} that subpopulation. When the data corruption is not distributed uniformly over subpopulations, our algorithms provide more meaningful robustness guarantees than standard guarantees that are oblivious to how the data corruption and the affected subpopulations are related. Our techniques establish a new connection between multigroup fairness and robustness.\n",

                "abstract": "A recent line of work has shown a surprising connection between multicalibration, a multi-group fairness notion, and omniprediction, a learning paradigm that provides simultaneous loss minimization guarantees for a large family of loss functions. Prior work studies omniprediction in the batch setting. We initiate the study of omniprediction in the online adversarial setting. Although there exist algorithms for obtaining notions of multicalibration in the online adversarial setting, unlike batch algorithms, they work only for small finite classes of benchmark functions $F$, because they require enumerating every function $f \\in F$ at every round. In contrast, omniprediction is most interesting for learning theoretic hypothesis classes $F$, which are generally continuously large. We develop a new online multicalibration algorithm that is well defined for infinite benchmark classes $F$, and is oracle efficient (i.e. for any class $F$, the algorithm has the form of an efficient reduction to a no-regret learning algorithm for $F$). The result is the first efficient online omnipredictor -- an oracle efficient prediction algorithm that can be used to simultaneously obtain no regret guarantees to all Lipschitz convex loss functions. For the class $F$ of linear functions, we show how to make our algorithm efficient in the worst case. Also, we show upper and lower bounds on the extent to which our rates can be improved: our oracle efficient algorithm actually promises a stronger guarantee called swap-omniprediction, and we prove a lower bound showing that obtaining $O(\\sqrt{T})$ bounds for swap-omniprediction is impossible in the online setting. On the other hand, we give a (non-oracle efficient) algorithm which can obtain the optimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ omniprediction bounds without going through multicalibration, giving an information theoretic separation between these two solution concepts."

Multicalibration is known to be a distinct goal than loss minimization, even for simple predictors such as linear functions. In this work, we consider the setting where the protected groups can be represented by neural networks of size $k$, and the predictors are neural networks of size $n>k$. We show that minimizing the squared loss over all neural nets of size $n$ implies multicalibration for all but a bounded number of unlucky values of $n$. We also give evidence that our bound on the number of unlucky values is tight, given our proof technique. Previously, results of the flavor that loss minimization yields multicalibration were known only for predictors that were near the ground truth, hence were rather limited in applicability. Unlike these, our results rely on the expressivity of neural nets and utilize the representation of the predictor."

To tackle this topic, in this paper, we study the problem of adversarial training and adversarial attack w.r.t. both metrics. We propose a unified structure for fairness attack which brings together common notions in group fairness, and we theoretically prove the equivalence of fairness attack against different notions. Moreover, we show the alignment of fairness and accuracy attack, and theoretically demonstrate that robustness w.r.t. one metric benefits from robustness w.r.t. the other metric. Our study suggests a novel way to unify adversarial training and attack w.r.t. fairness and accuracy, and experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better performance in terms of robustness w.r.t. both metrics."

We select instances based on their influence on the fairness metric of interest, computed using an infinitesimal jackknife-based approach. The dropping of training points is done in principle, but in practice does not require the model to be refit. Crucially, we find that such an intervention does not substantially reduce the predictive performance of the model but drastically improves the fairness metric. Through careful experiments, we evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on diverse tasks and find that it consistently improves upon existing alternatives."

                "abstract": "Researchers have proposed many methods for fair and robust machine learning, but comprehensive empirical evaluation of their subgroup robustness is lacking. In this work, we address this gap in the context of tabular data, where sensitive subgroups are clearly-defined, real-world fairness problems abound, and prior works often do not compare to state-of-the-art tree-based models as baselines. We conduct an empirical comparison of several previously-proposed methods for fair and robust learning alongside state-of-the-art tree-based methods and other baselines. Via experiments with more than $340{,}000$ model configurations on eight datasets, we show that tree-based methods have strong subgroup robustness, even when compared to robustness- and fairness-enhancing methods. Moreover, the best tree-based models tend to show good performance over a range of metrics, while robust or group-fair models can show brittleness, with significant performance differences across different metrics for a fixed model. We also demonstrate that tree-based models show less sensitivity to hyperparameter configurations, and are less costly to train. Our work suggests that tree-based ensemble models make an effective baseline for tabular data, and are a sensible default when subgroup robustness is desired.

By solving the proposed nonsmooth nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problem, the optimal adversary as well as the robust fairness-aware regression model are obtained.

                "abstract": "We present a new perspective on loss minimization and the recent notion of Omniprediction through the lens of Outcome Indistingusihability. For a collection of losses and hypothesis class, omniprediction requires that a predictor provide a loss-minimization guarantee simultaneously for every loss in the collection compared to the best (loss-specific) hypothesis in the class. We present a generic template to learn predictors satisfying a guarantee we call Loss Outcome Indistinguishability. For a set of statistical tests--based on a collection of losses and hypothesis class--a predictor is Loss OI if it is indistinguishable (according to the tests) from Nature's true probabilities over outcomes. By design, Loss OI implies omniprediction in a direct and intuitive manner. We simplify Loss OI further, decomposing it into a calibration condition plus multiaccuracy for a class of functions derived from the loss and hypothesis classes. By careful analysis of this class, we give efficient constructions of omnipredictors for interesting classes of loss functions, including non-convex losses. This decomposition highlights the utility of a new multi-group fairness notion that we call calibrated multiaccuracy, which lies in between multiaccuracy and multicalibration. We show that calibrated multiaccuracy implies Loss OI for the important set of convex losses arising from Generalized Linear Models, without requiring full multicalibration. For such losses, we show an equivalence between our computational notion of Loss OI and a geometric notion of indistinguishability, formulated as Pythagorean theorems in the associated Bregman divergence. We give an efficient algorithm for calibrated multiaccuracy with computational complexity comparable to that of multiaccuracy. In all, calibrated multiaccuracy offers an interesting tradeoff point between efficiency and generality in the omniprediction landscape."

Rather than learning a predictor based on a known loss function, omnipredictors can easily be post-processed to minimize any one of a rich family of loss functions compared with the loss of hypotheses in a class $\\mathcal C$. It has been shown that such omnipredictors exist and are implied (for all convex and Lipschitz loss functions) by the notion of multicalibration from the algorithmic fairness literature. In this paper, we introduce omnipredictors for constrained optimization and study their complexity and implications. The notion that we introduce allows the learner to be unaware of the loss function that will be later assigned as well as the constraints that will be later imposed, as long as the subpopulations that are used to define these constraints are known. We show how to obtain omnipredictors for constrained optimization problems, relying on appropriate variants of multicalibration.

Despite the complexity of the underlying process that is being approximated (e.g. end-to-end training and evaluation of deep neural networks), we show that even simple linear datamodels successfully predict model outputs. We then demonstrate that datamodels give rise to a variety of applications, such as: accurately predicting the effect of dataset counterfactuals; identifying brittle predictions; finding semantically similar examples; quantifying train-test leakage; and embedding data into a well-behaved and feature-rich representation space."

                "abstract": "Significance We revisit the problem of ensuring statistically valid inferences across diverse target populations from a single source of training data. Our approach builds a surprising technical connection between the inference problem and a technique developed for algorithmic fairness, called “multicalibration.” We derive a correspondence between the fairness goal, to protect subpopulations from miscalibrated predictions, and the statistical goal, to ensure unbiased estimates on target populations. We derive a single-source estimator that provides inferences in any downstream target population, whose performance is comparable to the popular target-specific approach of propensity score reweighting. Our approach can extend the benefits of evidence-based decision-making to communities that do not have the resources to collect high-quality data on their own. The gold-standard approaches for gleaning statistically valid conclusions from data involve random sampling from the population. Collecting properly randomized data, however, can be challenging, so modern statistical methods, including propensity score reweighting, aim to enable valid inferences when random sampling is not feasible. We put forth an approach for making inferences based on available data from a source population that may differ in composition in unknown ways from an eventual target population. Whereas propensity scoring requires a separate estimation procedure for each different target population, we show how to build a single estimator, based on source data alone, that allows for efficient and accurate estimates on any downstream target data. We demonstrate, theoretically and empirically, that our target-independent approach to inference, which we dub “universal adaptability,” is competitive with target-specific approaches that rely on propensity scoring. Our approach builds on a surprising connection between the problem of inferences in unspecified target populations and the multicalibration problem, studied in the burgeoning field of algorithmic fairness. We show how the multicalibration framework can be employed to yield valid inferences from a single source population across a diverse set of target populations."

Fairness is about learning an unbiased model while robustness is about learning from corrupted data, and it is known that addressing only one of them may have an adverse affect on the other. In this work, we propose a sample selection-based algorithm for fair and robust training. To this end, we formulate a combinatorial optimization problem for the unbiased selection of samples in the presence of data corruption. Observing that solving this optimization problem is strongly NP-hard, we propose a greedy algorithm that is efficient and effective in practice. Experiments show that our algorithm obtains fairness and robustness that are better than or comparable to the state-of-the-art technique, both on synthetic and benchmark real datasets. Moreover, unlike other fair and robust training baselines, our algorithm can be used by only modifying the sampling step in batch selection without changing the training algorithm or leveraging additional clean data."

We reconstruct a superset of the UCI Adult data from available US Census sources and reveal idiosyncrasies of the UCI Adult dataset that limit its external validity. Our primary contribution is a suite of new datasets derived from US Census surveys that extend the existing data ecosystem for research on fair machine learning. We create prediction tasks relating to income, employment, health, transportation, and housing. The data span multiple years and all states of the United States, allowing researchers to study temporal shift and geographic variation. We highlight a broad initial sweep of new empirical insights relating to trade-offs between fairness criteria, performance of algorithmic interventions, and the role of distribution shift based on our new datasets.

The vast majority of the activity in the field of group fairness addresses disparities between predeﬁned groups based on protected features such as gender, age, and race, which need to be available at train, and often also at test, time. These approaches are static and retrospective, since algorithms designed to protect groups identified a priori cannot anticipate and protect the needs of different at-risk groups in the future. In this work we analyze the space of solutions for worst-case fairness beyond demographics, and propose Blind Pareto Fairness (BPF), a method that leverages no-regret dynamics to recover a fair minimax classiﬁer that reduces worst-case risk of any potential subgroup of sufﬁcient size, and guarantees that the remaining population receives the best possible level of service. BPF addresses fairness beyond demographics, that is, it does not rely on predeﬁned notions of at-risk groups, neither at train nor at test time. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework improves worst-case risk in multiple standard datasets, while simultaneously providing better levels of service for the remaining population, in comparison to competing methods."

We begin by investigating where the data came from, and find a significant amount of text from unexpected sources like patents and US military websites. Then we explore the content of the text itself, and find machine-generated text (e.g., from machine translation systems) and evaluation examples from other benchmark NLP datasets. To understand the impact of the filters applied to create this dataset, we evaluate the text that was removed, and show that blocklist filtering disproportionately removes text from and about minority individuals.

We design a modular framework for subpopulation attacks, instantiate it with different building blocks, and show that the attacks are effective for a variety of datasets and machine learning models. We further optimize the attacks in continuous domains using influence functions and gradient optimization methods. Compared to existing backdoor poisoning attacks, subpopulation attacks have the advantage of inducing misclassification in naturally distributed data points at inference time, making the attacks extremely stealthy. We also show that our attack strategy can be used to improve upon existing targeted attacks. We prove that, under some assumptions, subpopulation attacks are impossible to defend against, and empirically demonstrate the limitations of existing defenses against our attacks, highlighting the difficulty of protecting machine learning against this threat."

Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) allows us to learn models that instead minimize the worst-case training loss over a set of pre-defined groups. However, we find that naively applying group DRO to overparameterized neural networks fails: these models can perfectly fit the training data, and any model with vanishing average training loss also already has vanishing worst-case training loss. Instead, the poor worst-case performance arises from poor generalization on some groups. By coupling group DRO models with increased regularization---a stronger-than-typical L2 penalty or early stopping---we achieve substantially higher worst-group accuracies, with 10-40 percentage point improvements on a natural language inference task and two image tasks, while maintaining high average accuracies. Our results suggest that regularization is important for worst-group generalization in the overparameterized regime, even if it is not needed for average generalization. Finally, we introduce a stochastic optimization algorithm, with convergence guarantees, to efficiently train group DRO models."

                "abstract": "Statisticians are increasingly posed with thought-provoking and even paradoxical questions, challenging our qualiﬁcations for entering the statistical paradises created by Big Data. By developing measures for data quality, this article suggests a framework to address such a question: “Which one should I trust more: a 1% survey with 60% response rate or a self-reported administrative dataset covering 80% of the population?” A 5-element Euler-formula-like identity shows that for any dataset of size n , probabilistic or not, the difference between the sample average X n and the population average X N is the product of three terms: (1) a data quality measure, ρ R,X , the correlation between X j and the response/recording indicator R j ; (2) a data quantity measure, √ (N − n)/n , where N is the population size; and (3) a problem difﬁculty measure, σ X , the standard deviation of X . This decompo-sition provides multiple insights: (I) Probabilistic sampling ensures high data quality by controlling ρ R,X at the level of N − 1 / 2 ; (II) When we lose this control, the impact of N is no longer canceled by ρ R,X , leading to a Law of Large Populations (LLP), that is, our estimation error, relative to the benchmarking rate 1 / √ n , increases with √ N ; and (III) the “bigness” of such Big Data (for population inferences) should be measured by the relative size f = n/N , not the absolute size n ; (IV) When combining data sources for population inferences, those relatively tiny but higher quality ones should be given far more weights than suggested by sizes. Estimates obtained from the Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES) of the 2016 US presidential election suggest a ρ R,X ≈ − 0 . 005 for self-reporting to vote for Donald Trump. Because of LLP, this seemingly mi-nuscule data defect correlation implies that the simple sample proportion of the self-reported voting preference for Trump from 1% of the US eligible voters, that is, n ≈ 2,300,000, has the same mean squared error as the corresponding sample proportion from a genuine simple random sample of size n ≈ 400, a 99 . 98% reduction of sample size (and hence our conﬁdence). The CCES data demonstrate LLP vividly: on average, the larger the state’s voter populations, the further away the actual Trump vote shares from the usual 95% conﬁdence intervals based on the sample proportions. This should remind us that, without taking data quality into account, population inferences with Big Data are subject to a Big Data Paradox : the more the data, the surer we fool ourselves."

Even when the overall accuracy is high, these systems may exhibit systematic biases that harm specific subpopulations; such biases may arise inadvertently due to underrepresentation in the data used to train a machine-learning model, or as the result of intentional malicious discrimination. We develop a rigorous framework of *multiaccuracy* auditing and post-processing to ensure accurate predictions across *identifiable subgroups*. Our algorithm, MULTIACCURACY-BOOST, works in any setting where we have black-box access to a predictor and a relatively small set of labeled data for auditing; importantly, this black-box framework allows for improved fairness and accountability of predictions, even when the predictor is minimally transparent. We prove that MULTIACCURACY-BOOST converges efficiently and show that if the initial model is accurate on an identifiable subgroup, then the post-processed model will be also. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach to improve the accuracy among minority subgroups in diverse applications (image classification, finance, population health). Interestingly, MULTIACCURACY-BOOST can improve subpopulation accuracy (e.g. for \"black women\") even when the sensitive features (e.g. \"race\", \"gender\") are not given to the algorithm explicitly."

                "abstract": "The most prevalent notions of fairness in machine learning are statistical definitions: they fix a small collection of pre-defined groups, and then ask for parity of some statistic of the classifier across these groups. Constraints of this form are susceptible to intentional or inadvertent \"fairness gerrymandering\", in which a classifier appears to be fair on each individual group, but badly violates the fairness constraint on one or more structured subgroups defined over the protected attributes. We propose instead to demand statistical notions of fairness across exponentially (or infinitely) many subgroups, defined by a structured class of functions over the protected attributes. This interpolates between statistical definitions of fairness and recently proposed individual notions of fairness, but raises several computational challenges. It is no longer clear how to audit a fixed classifier to see if it satisfies such a strong definition of fairness. We prove that the computational problem of auditing subgroup fairness for both equality of false positive rates and statistical parity is equivalent to the problem of weak agnostic learning, which means it is computationally hard in the worst case, even for simple structured subclasses. \nWe then derive two algorithms that provably converge to the best fair classifier, given access to oracles which can solve the agnostic learning problem. The algorithms are based on a formulation of subgroup fairness as a two-player zero-sum game between a Learner and an Auditor. Our first algorithm provably converges in a polynomial number of steps. Our second algorithm enjoys only provably asymptotic convergence, but has the merit of simplicity and faster per-step computation. We implement the simpler algorithm using linear regression as a heuristic oracle, and show that we can effectively both audit and learn fair classifiers on real datasets."

When both the mean and covariance are unknown, the running time is polynomial in $d$ and quasipolynomial in $1/\\varepsilon$.

This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well.

                "\n\nThe gap between standard distributional assumptions and practical dataset limitations has been well-studied in machine learning literature -- from unintended distribution shift to adversarially crafted data manipulations. \nCorresponding notions of \\emph{robustness} have been developed to reflect the goal of learning well in the presence of adversarially corrupted data, as well as attacks demonstrating that small amounts of corrupted data can seriously impact performance. \nWhile attacks that target specific subgroups have been proposed~\\citep{jagielski2021subpopulation}, they give the adversary the power to change any point in the dataset to achieve its goal--even the ability to modify seemingly unrelated points outside the subgroup of interest. While this is reasonable as a strong worst-case adversarial assumption, data corruption issues are often far more localized in reality. In surveys, response bias may compromise answers from certain subpopulations \\citep{meng2018statistical, bradley2021unrepresentative}. As another example, when amassing internet data for training large models, certain sources can be less trustworthy or more toxic than others~\\citep{dodge2021documenting}. Since limitations to datasets may be isolated to certain groups, it is important to develop a fine-grained notion of robustness that ensures groups do not suffer undue harm due to corruption in unrelated data.\n\\paragraph{A fine-grained robustness notion} We consider a new data-aware notion of robustness that we term \\emph{multigroup robustness}. At a high-level, a multigroup-robust learning algorithm guarantees that the effects of dataset corruption on every subpopulation-of-interest are bounded by the amount of corruption to data within that subpopulation (Figure~\\ref{fig:multigroup-robustness-diagram}).\n\nMore formally, we consider a binary-label learning problem where data from a domain $X$ labeled with $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is inputted into a deterministic learning algorithm $\\cA: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow [0, 1]^X$ that outputs a predictor $p \\in [0, 1]^X$. Given a set of subpopulations $\\cC \\subseteq 2^X$, we say that $\\cA$ is multigroup robust with respect to $\\cC$ if, given a dataset $S = \\{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)\\}$ where the $x_i$s are each drawn i.i.d. from some unknown distribution $\\cD_X$, given any other potentially corrupted dataset $S' = \\{(x_1', y_1'), ..., (x_m', y_m')\\}$, we can guarantee that the difference in the mean prediction of \\emph{every} group $C \\in \\cC$ is bounded by the amount of change to $C$ between $S$ and $S'$, i.e. \n\\[\\left|\\bE_{\\cD_X}[\\left(\\cA(S)(x) - \\cA(S')(x)\\right)\\one[x \\in C]]\\right| \\leq \\mathsf{dist}_C(S, S')\\]\nwhere $\\mathsf{dist}_C(S, S')$ is a measure of the changes to the set of points belonging to $C$ between $S$ and $S'$, which we will formalize in Section~\\ref{sec:multi-robust}. \n\nIntuitively, this definition asks that when the points from a group are unchanged or change very little in $S'$ (i.e. translating to a small $\\mathsf{dist}_C(S, S')$), then the average prediction outputted by $\\cA$ on that group should also not change by much, thus preserving the group's accuracy-in-expectation. %\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{multi-group-robustness.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\small Intuitive illustration of multigroup robustness: for every group $C$, if points within the group are not modified, a multigroup robust algorithm produces a predictor that achieves marginal mean consistency with the clean data predictor (See Definition \\ref{def:multigroup-robust}).}\n    \\label{fig:multigroup-robustness-diagram}\n\\end{figure}\nIt is easy to construct algorithms that satisfy multigroup robustness, but are not very useful as learning algorithms; for example, the algorithm that always outputs the same predictor for any dataset. Thus, we will concentrate on the particular question of whether there exist efficient learning algorithms that provide multigroup robustness as well as an agnostic learning guarantee, i.e., that the predictor outputted by $\\cA$ performs at least as well as the best predictor from some benchmark set $\\cP \\subseteq [0, 1]^X$. \n\n\\paragraph{Standard algorithms are not multigroup robust} Classic agnostic learning algorithms such as empirical risk minimization over the benchmark class can fail to satisfy multigroup robustness even for extremely simple families of subpopulations. Consider as an example the benchmark class containing the all ones or all zeros predictors, $\\cP = \\{p_0, p_1\\}$, and a uniform distribution over $X$ where half of the points ($x \\in X_0$) are labeled with 0s, and half of the points ($x \\in X_1$) are labelled with ones. Given a sample from this half-and-half distribution, ERM will output the predictor matching the majority label in the dataset. However, because most datasets drawn will be close to half ones and half zeros, this means that only a tiny number of corrupted labels can drastically change the output from $p_0$ to $p_1$ or vice versa, impacting the predictions of a huge number of points despite not changing the overall accuracy by much. \n\nIn Section \\ref{sec:experiments}, we empirically demonstrate that several standard models for classification fail to preserve multigroup robustness under simple label-flipping and data addition attacks on the Adult Income Dataset. \n\n\\paragraph{Connections to multiaccuracy} In light of these successful attacks, new ideas are necessary to develop algorithms that can match the performance guarantees of standard learning approaches while being multigroup robust.\n\nWhen we only care about a small number of disjoint groups, a naive solution that provides multigroup robustness could be to simply train a separate model on each group's data. However, this approach becomes inefficient as we consider a growing number of possibly overlapping groups. Moreover, the individually trained models may lose out on the predictive power that could be gained from using the dataset as a whole. \n\nInstead, we turn to the notion of \\emph{multiaccuracy}, a learning objective originating in the algorithmic fairness literature that asks for a predictor to satisfy accuracy-in-expectation simultaneously on many groups~\\citep{hebert2018multicalibration, kim2019multiaccuracy}. In Section~\\ref{sec:ma-and-robust} we outline how multiaccuracy's rigorous group-level guarantees can connect to our goal of multigroup robustness. However, because standard multiaccuracy algorithms assume access to i.i.d. data, we encounter challenges to using them in our setting where due to adversarial corruption, we cannot assume data is i.i.d.. We demonstrate how to bypass these obstacles by making appropriate modifications to standard multiaccuracy algorithms, and present a set of sufficient conditions for algorithms that provably achieve multigroup robustness. In Section~\\ref{sec:lower-bd}, we supplement our results with a lower bound showing that multiaccuracy is a necessary property of any non-trivial algorithm that satisfies multigroup robustness. \n\n\\paragraph{Achieving multigroup robustness} With these sufficient conditions in hand, in Section~\\ref{sec:implementing} we present an efficient post-processing approach that can be used to augment any existing learning algorithm to add both multigroup robustness and multiaccuracy guarantees, while preserving the performance guarantees of the original learning algorithm.\n\nIn Section~\\ref{sec:experiments}, we supplement our theoretical results with experiments on real-world census datasets demonstrating that our post-processing approach can be added to existing learning algorithms to provide multigroup robustness protections without a drop in accuracy. \n\n\\subsection{Our Contributions}\nTo summarize, we list our main contributions below:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Define a new notion of data-aware robustness, \\emph{multigroup robustness}, that ensures subgroups do not suffer undue harm due to corruptions in unrelated data (Section~\\ref{sec:multi-robust}).  \n    \\item Demonstrate general sufficient conditions for an algorithm to be multigroup robust by drawing connections to multiaccuracy (Section~\\ref{sec:ma-and-robust}), and show that multiaccuracy is necessary for non-trivial multigroup robust algorithms (Section~\\ref{sec:lower-bd}). \n    \\item Present an efficient post-processing algorithm that can provide an arbitrary learning algorithm with multigroup robustness guarantees while preserving performance (Section~\\ref{sec:implementing}). \n    \\item Empirically validate that standard learning algorithms are vulnerable to simple attacks on multigroup robustness, and that our postprocessing method successfully protects against these attacks while preserving accuracy (Section~\\ref{sec:experiments}). \n\\end{itemize}\n\n"

Our proofs are largely inspired by previous algorithms for \\emph{multiaccuracy}. We identify several key challenges in using those algorithms in our setting with corrupted data, and address these challenges by making appropriate modifications.\n\nWe first introduce the definition of multiaccuracy~\\citep{hebert2018multicalibration}, a notion of algorithmic fairness that requires a predictor be accurate in expectation for every group in some collection of subgroups $C \\subseteq 2^X$.

Given $n \\in  \\bZ^+, \\varepsilon > 0$, $\\delta \\in [0, 1]$, we say that a deterministic learning algorithm $\\cA: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow [0,1]^X$ is $(\\cC, n, \\varepsilon, \\delta)$-multiaccurate if for any distribution $\\cD$ over $X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$, given $n$ i.i.d. data points $S = (x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ from $\\cD$, the predictor $\\cA(S)$ satisfies $(\\cC, \\varepsilon)$-MA on $\\cD$ with probability at least $1 - \\delta$. \n\\end{definition}\n\n\n\\subsection{Standard Multiaccuracy Gives Multigroup Robustness under Distribution Shift}\n\nWe begin by considering a setting where an adversary can only corrupt the data \\emph{distribution} rather than the sampled datapoints themselves, and show that in this setting, learners that output multiaccurate predictors with respect to a collection $\\cC$ are also multigroup robust to distribution shift with respect to $\\cC$. \n\nFor ease of notation, for a given distribution $\\cD$, predictor $p$, and subpopulation $C \\subseteq X$ we denote $\\mae_{\\cD}(p, C) := \\bE_{(x, y) \\sim \\cD}[(y - p(x))\\one[x \\in C]]$. \n\n\\begin{lemma}[Robustness from MA]\\label{lem:ma-rob}\nGiven two distributions $\\cD, \\cD'$ over $X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$ and a collection of subsets $\\cC \\subseteq 2^X$, let $p$ and $p'$ be $(\\cC, \\varepsilon)$-MA predictors with respect to $\\cD$ and $\\cD'$, respectively.

This is a key property that allows us to apply multiaccuracy algorithms that assume access to an i.i.d. datasource. \n\nMoving beyond distributional shifts, we are also interested in stronger adversaries that can directly corrupt a data sample either through label change or addition/deletion of points. In the presence of these stronger adversaries, we can no longer assume access to an ``clean'' i.i.d. datasource. \nIn the absence of i.i.d. data, we can still work with the empirical distribution: the uniform distribution over the data points. However, because multigroup robustness is a statement about the predictor similarity over the \\emph{true marginal distribution $D_X$}, it's not clear whether relying on the corrupted empirical distribution alone can give us these distributional guarantees necessary for robustness. \n\nDespite this obstacle, our main result shows that by leveraging an additional uniform-convergence assumption, we can in fact achieve multigroup robustness against strong dataset-dependent adversaries for any algorithm that guarantees multiaccuracy on the empirical distribution. \nOur analysis for handling adversarially corrupted data differs from typical analyses where the uniform convergence assumption is applied to a learning algorithm with i.i.d.\\ input data (see \\Cref{rem:uniform-cvg}).\n\n\nWe begin by showing in Lemma~\\ref{lem:ma-ptwise-rob} that guaranteeing empirical multiaccuracy already yields a guarantee of predictor-closeness when measured over the empirical distribution of the uncorrupted dataset.

This means that to show that multigroup robustness holds, it suffices to show that the empirical quantity $\\left|\\bE_{(x, y) \\sim \\mathsf{Uni}(S)}[(p'(x) - p(x))\\one[x \\in C]]\\right|$ is close to its population limit, $\\left|\\bE_{x \\sim D_x}[(p'(x) - p(x))\\one[x \\in C]]\\right|$, for all $C \\in \\cC$. \n\nOur main result uses this reasoning to show that a learning algorithm that outputs a predictor multiaccurate with respect to the empirical distribution satisfies multigroup robustness whenever we can guarantee \\emph{uniform convergence} over all possible outputted predictors and subpopulations (See Definition~\\ref{def:uniform-cvg} for a formal definition). \nWe additionally show that under this assumption we can guarantee the outputted predictor is multiaccurate with respect to the target distribution when the learning algorithm is given uncorrupted i.i.d. data (Theorem~\\ref{thm:general-robustness-and-ma}). \n\n\\begin{definition}\\label{def:uniform-cvg}\n    Let $\\cC \\subseteq 2^X$ be a class of subpopulations, and let $\\cP \\subseteq [0, 1]^X$ be a family of predictors.

                "\nSo far, we have demonstrated sufficient conditions for a learning algorithm to satisfy multigroup robustness (empirical multiaccuracy and uniform convergence). We now show that multigroup robustness can be achieved efficiently in parallel with standard accuracy objectives. In particular, we present a post-processing procedure that can convert any black-box learning algorithm into a multigroup robust learning algorithm that minimizes $\\ell_2$ error.\n\n\\subsection{Post-processing Approach}\n\nWe consider a setting where we are given access to an arbitrary deterministic learning algorithm $\\cA: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow [0, 1]^X$. We will demonstrate how to post-process this algorithm to produce a new algorithm $\\mathsf{PP}_{\\cA}: (X \\times\\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow [0, 1]^X$ (Algorithm~\\ref{alg:ma-empirical}) that provides comparable performance to that of $\\cA$ in terms of $\\ell_2$ error while also satisfying multigroup robustness. We present our post-processing approach in Algorithm~\\ref{alg:ma-empirical}.\n\n\\begin{algorithm}\n    \\caption{Multiaccuracy Boost on Empirical Distribution}\n    \\label{alg:ma-empirical}\n    \\begin{algorithmic}\n       \\STATE {\\bfseries Parameters: }$n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$, $\\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$, $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\{0, 1\\}^X$\n       \\STATE {\\bfseries Input: }data points $(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n) \\in X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$, learning algorithm $\\cA:\\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow [0, 1]^X$\n       \\STATE {\\bfseries Output: }predictor $p:X\\rightarrow[0,1]$\n\n       \\STATE {\\bfseries Step 1: Training}\n       \\STATE  initialize $p \\leftarrow \\cA((x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n))$\n\n       \\STATE {\\bfseries Step 2: Post-processing}\n       \\WHILE{$\\exists C \\in \\mathcal{C}$ s.t. $|\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^n(p(x_i) - y_i)\\one(x_i \\in C)| > \\varepsilon$}\n            \\STATE $v_C := \\mathsf{sgn}\\left(\\sum_{i = 1}^n (p(x_i) - y_i)\\one(x_i \\in C)\\right)$\n            \\FORALL{$x \\in C$}\n                \\STATE $p(x) \\leftarrow p(x) - v_C\\epsilon$\n                \\STATE $p(x) \\leftarrow \\max \\{0, \\min\\{p(x), 1\\}\\}$\n            \\ENDFOR\n        \\ENDWHILE\n\n        \\STATE {\\bfseries Return: }$p$\n    \\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\nAlgorithm~\\ref{alg:ma-empirical} uses an iterative auditing approach to bring the predictor closer to being multiaccurate with each iteration of the While loop in Step 2. This is similar to standard algorithms for multiaccuracy presented in the \nliterature~\\citep{hebert2018multicalibration, kim2019multiaccuracy}, but is differentiated in that it audits using \\emph{the entire dataset} at each iteration, rather than sampling fresh data for each update step. This alteration is necessary in order to guarantee we achieve empirical\nmultiaccuracy.\nIt follows immediately from the definition of Algorithm~\\ref{alg:ma-empirical} that it outputs an empirically multiaccurate predictor (See Lemma~\\ref{lem:stopping-condition}). We can also show that the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate in a bounded number of steps, and thus the class of predictors it can output is also bounded, giving us a uniform convergence result that we state formally and prove in Lemma~\\ref{lem:uniform-convergence}.\n\nLemmas~\\ref{lem:stopping-condition} and \\ref{lem:uniform-convergence} give us the two sufficient conditions for multigroup robustness described in Section~\\ref{sec:multi-robust} (empirical multiaccuracy and uniform convergence, respectively). Thus, we can show that $\\mathsf{PP}_{\\cA}$ satisfies multigroup-robustness and multiaccuracy:\n\n\\begin{theorem}\n    Let $\\cA: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow \\cP$ be a deterministic learning algorithm that is guaranteed to output from a finite set of predictors $\\cP \\subseteq [0, 1]^X$. Let $\\mathsf{PP}_{\\cA}$ be the algorithm defined by Algorithm~\\ref{alg:ma-empirical} on input $\\cA$ with input parameter $\\epsilon>0$. Then, for any $\\delta \\in [0, 1]$, $\\mathsf{PP}_{\\cA}$ satisfies $(\\cC, n, (3 + \\frac{m}{n})\\epsilon, \\delta)$-multigroup robustness and $(\\cC, n, 3\\epsilon, \\delta)$-multiaccuracy for any $n \\geq \\frac{\\log(|\\cP|(2|\\cC|)^{1/\\epsilon^2 + 1}/\\delta)}{2\\epsilon^2}$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    The theorem follows immediately by combining Theorem~\\ref{thm:general-robustness-and-ma} with Lemmas~\\ref{lem:stopping-condition} and \\ref{lem:uniform-convergence}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\subsection{Loss Minimization Guarantee}\n\nLastly, we show that the post-processed predictor is not much worse than the initial predictor outputted by the original learning algorithm. Intuitively, this result follows from Lemma~\\ref{lem:l2-dec}, which tells us that each iteration of the post-processing step decreases the predictor's empirical $\\ell_2$-loss by at least $\\epsilon^2$. With this fact in hand, we can appeal to uniform convergence to show that the loss decrease also generalizes to the entire distribution. \n\n\\begin{corollary}[Corollary to Theorem~\\ref{thm:loss-min}]\n    Let $\\cA:(X \\times\\{0, 1\\}^*) \\rightarrow \\cP$ be a deterministic learning algorithm that is guaranteed to output from a finite set of predictors $\\cP \\subseteq [0, 1]^X$. Let $\\mathsf{PP}_{\\cA}$ be the algorithm defined by Algorithm~\\ref{alg:ma-empirical} on input $\\cA$ with parameter $\\epsilon > 0$. Given a sample $S = \\{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)\\}$ drawn i.i.d. from some distribution $\\cD$ over $X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$, let $p := \\cA(S)$ be the predictor output by $\\cA$ on $S$, and let $p_{\\mathsf{PP}} := \\mathsf{PP}_{\\cA}$ be the predictor output after post-processing. Then, for any $\\delta \\in [0, 1]$ and $n \\geq \\frac{\\log(|\\cP|(2|\\cC|)^{1/\\epsilon^2})}{2\\epsilon^2}$, we are guaranteed that with probability at least $1 - \\delta$\n    \\[\\bE_{\\cD}[(y - p_{\\mathsf{PP}}(x))^2] \\leq \\bE_{\\cD}[(y - p(x))^2] + 2\\epsilon.\\]\n\\end{corollary}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{label_shift.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\small The effect of label change (0 to 1) in White male group on other subpopulations.

This property is often guaranteed for multicalibration algorithms (see e.g., \\Cref{lem:uniform-convergence}).\\footnote{While our results are stated for multiaccuracy, they can be applied to multicalibration with appropriate modifications.} At a high level, previous multicalibration algorithms are analogous to the original boosting algorithm \\citep{weak}, whereas ours are analogous to AdaBoost algorithm \\citep{adaboost}. Using this alternative approach is crucial for our robustness guarantees.\n\\paragraph{Omniprediction.} Recent work has explored the concept of an \\emph{omnipredictor}--a predictor whose predictions can be post-processed to select near-optimal actions for a large variety of loss functions, rather than needing to train the predictor to optimize for a specific loss function~\\citep{gopalan2022omnipredictors, gopalan2023loss, hu2023omnipredictors, garg2024oracle}. It is known that multicalibration (a strengthening of multiaccuracy) is a sufficient condition for omniprediction. We note that our algorithm can be extended to the setting of multicalibration with appropriate modifications, which would provide a multigroup robust omniprediction algorithm that could provide accuracy guarantees beyond $\\ell_2$ loss. However, we note that while such an algorithm would be multigroup robust with respect to the outputted predictor, it is not clear if it would be multigroup robust with respect to the post-processed optimal actions. We leave this as a direction for future work. \n\\paragraph{Postprocessing on Fresh Data.} While we envision using our post-processing step as part of an end-to-end learning pipeline and thus use the original data during post-processing, in certain settings, the original learning algorithm's training data may be unavailable and the post-processing step might need to use fresh data. In this case, we would continue to preserve accuracy guarantees, but could only guarantee multigroup robustness against strong adversaries with respect to the dataset used for post-processing. In the weaker distribution shift setting, fresh data for post-processing is enough to ensure overall multigroup robustness assuming that the distribution of the post-processing set is the same as that of the training data. \n\n"

We compare robustness to different attacks in two settings for two models: (1) \\textsc{Clf}: Base classifier model: either logistic regression (LR) or a two-layer neural network (MLP), and (2) \\textsc{Clf-PP}: Base classifier with post-processing using Algorithm \\ref{alg:ma-empirical}. \nWe report subgroup $C$ accuracy and multi-accuracy error for each model at different noise rates:  \n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\mathsf{Acc}_{\\cD}(p, C)$: $\\frac{1}{|C|}\\sum_{(x_i, y_i) \\in C }\\one[y_i = \\one[p(x_i)>\\gamma]]$\n    \\item $\\mae_{\\cD}(p, C)$: $\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^n(p(x_i) - y_i)\\one(x_i \\in C)$\n\\end{itemize}\nWe seek to measure these quantities since the multi-accuracy error is the supremum of this $\\mae_{\\cD}(p, C)$ across all identifiable subgroups $C \\in \\cC$ and $\\mathsf{Acc}_{\\cD}(p, C)$ gives an average classification metric where the $\\gamma$ threshold is optimized on the entire held-out validation set.\n\n\\paragraph{Label-Change}\nWe first consider robustness to label change when the set of training examples is unchanged. Figure \\ref{fig:type1-label-shift} shows the effect of randomly shifting labels in the White male group on three other groups that are unchanged: White female, Black or African American Male and Female subgroups. For Logistic Regression, the base classifier \\textsc{Clf}, results in increased bias as the noise rate increases while the \\textsc{Clf-PP} predictor retains a low multi-accuracy error while maintaining similar accuracy to the original model. A similar phenomenon is observed in the neural network (MLP) where \\textsc{Clf-PP} remains multigroup robust. \n\n\\paragraph{Addition/Deletion}\nWe also demonstrate the robustness of Algorithm \\ref{alg:ma-empirical} through to additional data points designed to attack a specific target group. We employ a similar strategy as prior work designing subpopulation attacks~\\citep{jagielski2021subpopulation} with the additional constraint that only data points outside of the target group can be used to create the poisoning dataset. To find data points to add that would affect the target group, we first cluster data points in a held-out set (not used for training or testing) using K-means. For each cluster where the target subgroup appears, we shift the labels of the of points we are allowed to modify and add them to the training data. The amount of noise in this attack is scaled by how many times the identified data points are replicated before being added to the poisoned dataset. In Figure \\ref{fig:type2-addition}, we see that even at low levels of noise (i.e., poisoned points are replicated once or twice), the Logistic Regression and Neural Network (MLP) classifiers exhibit worsened multi-accuracy error while their post-processed counterparts (\\textsc{Clf-PP}) exhibit consistently low $\\mae$ without lower accuracy. \n\n"

Traditional robust learning algorithms focus on overcoming arbitrary and indiscriminate data corruption, assuming that the corrupted data is uniformly distributed across the dataset. However, practical data collection processes often lead to patterns of data corruption that are localized to specific partitions of the training dataset. This localized corruption can disproportionately affect certain subpopulations, leading to unfair and inaccurate predictions. Existing methods for robust learning do not adequately address this issue, as they typically assume that the data corruption is uniformly distributed. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a new notion of robustness, termed 'multigroup robustness,' which ensures that the effects of data corruption on each subpopulation only degrade with the amount of corruption within that subpopulation. This approach provides more meaningful robustness guarantees than standard guarantees that are oblivious to the relationship between data corruption and affected subpopulations.

For a collection of losses and hypothesis class, omniprediction requires that a predictor provide a loss-minimization guarantee simultaneously for every loss in the collection compared to the best (loss-specific) hypothesis in the class. We present a generic template to learn predictors satisfying a guarantee we call Loss Outcome Indistinguishability. For a set of statistical tests--based on a collection of losses and hypothesis class--a predictor is Loss OI if it is indistinguishable (according to the tests) from Nature's true probabilities over outcomes. By design, Loss OI implies omniprediction in a direct and intuitive manner. We simplify Loss OI further, decomposing it into a calibration condition plus multiaccuracy for a class of functions derived from the loss and hypothesis classes. By careful analysis of this class, we give efficient constructions of omnipredictors for interesting classes of loss functions, including non-convex losses. This decomposition highlights the utility of a new multi-group fairness notion that we call calibrated multiaccuracy, which lies in between multiaccuracy and multicalibration. We show that calibrated multiaccuracy implies Loss OI for the important set of convex losses arising from Generalized Linear Models, without requiring full multicalibration. For such losses, we show an equivalence between our computational notion of Loss OI and a geometric notion of indistinguishability, formulated as Pythagorean theorems in the associated Bregman divergence. We give an efficient algorithm for calibrated multiaccuracy with computational complexity comparable to that of multiaccuracy. In all, calibrated multiaccuracy offers an interesting tradeoff point between efficiency and generality in the omniprediction landscape.\n@inproceedings{gopalan2023loss,\n  title={Loss Minimization Through the Lens Of Outcome Indistinguishability},\n  author={Gopalan, Parikshit and Hu, Lunjia and Kim, Michael P and Reingold, Omer and Wieder, Udi},\n  booktitle={14th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science Conference (ITCS 2023)},\n  year={2023},\n  organization={Schloss Dagstuhl-Leibniz-Zentrum f{\\\"u}r Informatik}\n}\n\nAbstract: The notion of omnipredictors (Gopalan, Kalai, Reingold, Sharan and Wieder ITCS 2021), suggested a new paradigm for loss minimization. Rather than learning a predictor based on a known loss function, omnipredictors can easily be post-processed to minimize any one of a rich family of loss functions compared with the loss of hypotheses in a class $\\mathcal C$. It has been shown that such omnipredictors exist and are implied (for all convex and Lipschitz loss functions) by the notion of multicalibration from the algorithmic fairness literature. In this paper, we introduce omnipredictors for constrained optimization and study their complexity and implications. The notion that we introduce allows the learner to be unaware of the loss function that will be later assigned as well as the constraints that will be later imposed, as long as the subpopulations that are used to define these constraints are known. We show how to obtain omnipredictors for constrained optimization problems, relying on appropriate variants of multicalibration. We also investigate the implications of this notion when the constraints used are so-called group fairness notions.\n@inproceedings{hu2023omnipredictors,\n  title={Omnipredictors for constrained optimization},\n  author={Hu, Lunjia and Navon, Inbal Rachel Livni and Reingold, Omer and Yang, Chutong},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},\n  pages={13497--13527},\n  year={2023},\n  organization={PMLR}\n}\n\nAbstract: A recent line of work has shown a surprising connection between multicalibration, a multi-group fairness notion, and omniprediction, a learning paradigm that provides simultaneous loss minimization guarantees for a large family of loss functions. Prior work studies omniprediction in the batch setting. We initiate the study of omniprediction in the online adversarial setting. Although there exist algorithms for obtaining notions of multicalibration in the online adversarial setting, unlike batch algorithms, they work only for small finite classes of benchmark functions $F$, because they require enumerating every function $f \\in F$ at every round. In contrast, omniprediction is most interesting for learning theoretic hypothesis classes $F$, which are generally continuously large. We develop a new online multicalibration algorithm that is well defined for infinite benchmark classes $F$, and is oracle efficient (i.e. for any class $F$, the algorithm has the form of an efficient reduction to a no-regret learning algorithm for $F$). The result is the first efficient online omnipredictor -- an oracle efficient prediction algorithm that can be used to simultaneously obtain no regret guarantees to all Lipschitz convex loss functions. For the class $F$ of linear functions, we show how to make our algorithm efficient in the worst case. Also, we show upper and lower bounds on the extent to which our rates can be improved: our oracle efficient algorithm actually promises a stronger guarantee called swap-omniprediction, and we prove a lower bound showing that obtaining $O(\\sqrt{T})$ bounds for swap-omniprediction is impossible in the online setting. On the other hand, we give a (non-oracle efficient) algorithm which can obtain the optimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ omniprediction bounds without going through multicalibration, giving an information theoretic separation between these two solution concepts.\n@inproceedings{garg2024oracle,\n  title={Oracle efficient online multicalibration and omniprediction},\n  author={Garg, Sumegha and Jung, Christopher and Reingold, Omer and Roth, Aaron},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2024 Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA)},\n  pages={2725--2792},\n  year={2024},\n  organization={SIAM}\n}\n\nAbstract: We study the fundamental problem of learning the parameters of a high-dimensional Gaussian in the presence of noise -- where an $\\varepsilon$-fraction of our samples were chosen by an adversary. We give robust estimators that achieve estimation error $O(\\varepsilon)$ in the total variation distance, which is optimal up to a universal constant that is independent of the dimension. \nIn the case where just the mean is unknown, our robustness guarantee is optimal up to a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$ and the running time is polynomial in $d$ and $1/\\epsilon$. When both the mean and covariance are unknown, the running time is polynomial in $d$ and quasipolynomial in $1/\\varepsilon$.

Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the ℓ1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.\n@article{robust-pca,\nauthor = {Cand\\`{e}s, Emmanuel J. and Li, Xiaodong and Ma, Yi and Wright, John},\ntitle = {Robust principal component analysis?},\nyear = {2011},\nissue_date = {May 2011},\npublisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},\naddress = {New York, NY, USA},\nvolume = {58},\nnumber = {3},\nissn = {0004-5411},\nurl = {https://doi.org/10.1145/1970392.1970395},\ndoi = {10.1145/1970392.1970395},\njournal = {J.

This is in contrast to much recent work where the noise itself is assumed to be from a distribution of known type. The agnostic problem includes many interesting special cases, e.g., learning the parameters of a single Gaussian (or finding the best-fit Gaussian) when a fraction of data is adversarially corrupted, agnostically learning mixtures, agnostic ICA, etc. We present polynomial-time algorithms to estimate the mean and covariance with error guarantees in terms of information-theoretic lower bounds.

Constraints of this form are susceptible to intentional or inadvertent \"fairness gerrymandering\", in which a classifier appears to be fair on each individual group, but badly violates the fairness constraint on one or more structured subgroups defined over the protected attributes. We propose instead to demand statistical notions of fairness across exponentially (or infinitely) many subgroups, defined by a structured class of functions over the protected attributes. This interpolates between statistical definitions of fairness and recently proposed individual notions of fairness, but raises several computational challenges. It is no longer clear how to audit a fixed classifier to see if it satisfies such a strong definition of fairness. We prove that the computational problem of auditing subgroup fairness for both equality of false positive rates and statistical parity is equivalent to the problem of weak agnostic learning, which means it is computationally hard in the worst case, even for simple structured subclasses. \nWe then derive two algorithms that provably converge to the best fair classifier, given access to oracles which can solve the agnostic learning problem. The algorithms are based on a formulation of subgroup fairness as a two-player zero-sum game between a Learner and an Auditor. Our first algorithm provably converges in a polynomial number of steps. Our second algorithm enjoys only provably asymptotic convergence, but has the merit of simplicity and faster per-step computation. We implement the simpler algorithm using linear regression as a heuristic oracle, and show that we can effectively both audit and learn fair classifiers on real datasets.\n@InProceedings{gerrymander,\n  title = \t {Preventing Fairness Gerrymandering: Auditing and Learning for Subgroup Fairness},\n  author =       {Kearns, Michael and Neel, Seth and Roth, Aaron and Wu, Zhiwei Steven},\n  booktitle = \t {Proceedings of the 35th International Conference on Machine Learning},\n  pages = \t {2564--2572},\n  year = \t {2018},\n  editor = \t {Dy, Jennifer and Krause, Andreas},\n  volume = \t {80},\n  series = \t {Proceedings of Machine Learning Research},\n  month = \t {10--15 Jul},\n  publisher =    {PMLR},\n  pdf = \t {http://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/kearns18a/kearns18a.pdf},\n  url = \t {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v80/kearns18a.html}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: Significance We revisit the problem of ensuring statistically valid inferences across diverse target populations from a single source of training data. Our approach builds a surprising technical connection between the inference problem and a technique developed for algorithmic fairness, called “multicalibration.” We derive a correspondence between the fairness goal, to protect subpopulations from miscalibrated predictions, and the statistical goal, to ensure unbiased estimates on target populations. We derive a single-source estimator that provides inferences in any downstream target population, whose performance is comparable to the popular target-specific approach of propensity score reweighting. Our approach can extend the benefits of evidence-based decision-making to communities that do not have the resources to collect high-quality data on their own. The gold-standard approaches for gleaning statistically valid conclusions from data involve random sampling from the population. Collecting properly randomized data, however, can be challenging, so modern statistical methods, including propensity score reweighting, aim to enable valid inferences when random sampling is not feasible. We put forth an approach for making inferences based on available data from a source population that may differ in composition in unknown ways from an eventual target population. Whereas propensity scoring requires a separate estimation procedure for each different target population, we show how to build a single estimator, based on source data alone, that allows for efficient and accurate estimates on any downstream target data. We demonstrate, theoretically and empirically, that our target-independent approach to inference, which we dub “universal adaptability,” is competitive with target-specific approaches that rely on propensity scoring. Our approach builds on a surprising connection between the problem of inferences in unspecified target populations and the multicalibration problem, studied in the burgeoning field of algorithmic fairness. We show how the multicalibration framework can be employed to yield valid inferences from a single source population across a diverse set of target populations.\n@article{\nuniadapt,\nauthor = {Michael P.

However, the problem of adversarial training in terms of fairness has not yet been properly studied, and the relationship between fairness and accuracy attack still remains unclear. Can we simultaneously improve robustness w.r.t. both fairness and accuracy? To tackle this topic, in this paper, we study the problem of adversarial training and adversarial attack w.r.t. both metrics. We propose a unified structure for fairness attack which brings together common notions in group fairness, and we theoretically prove the equivalence of fairness attack against different notions. Moreover, we show the alignment of fairness and accuracy attack, and theoretically demonstrate that robustness w.r.t. one metric benefits from robustness w.r.t. the other metric. Our study suggests a novel way to unify adversarial training and attack w.r.t. fairness and accuracy, and experimental results show that our proposed method achieves better performance in terms of robustness w.r.t. both metrics.\n@article{chai2023robust,\n  title={To be Robust and to be Fair: Aligning Fairness with Robustness},\n  author={Chai, Junyi and Wang, Xiaoqian},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.00061},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\nAbstract: Large language models have led to remarkable progress on many NLP tasks, and researchers are turning to ever-larger text corpora to train them. Some of the largest corpora available are made by scraping significant portions of the internet, and are frequently introduced with only minimal documentation. In this work we provide some of the first documentation for the Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus (C4; Raffel et al., 2020), a dataset created by applying a set of filters to a single snapshot of Common Crawl. We begin by investigating where the data came from, and find a significant amount of text from unexpected sources like patents and US military websites. Then we explore the content of the text itself, and find machine-generated text (e.g., from machine translation systems) and evaluation examples from other benchmark NLP datasets. To understand the impact of the filters applied to create this dataset, we evaluate the text that was removed, and show that blocklist filtering disproportionately removes text from and about minority individuals. Finally, we conclude with some recommendations for how to created and document web-scale datasets from a scrape of the internet.\n@article{dodge2021documenting,\n  title={Documenting large webtext corpora: A case study on the colossal clean crawled corpus},\n  author={Dodge, Jesse and Sap, Maarten and Marasovi{\\'c}, Ana and Agnew, William and Ilharco, Gabriel and Groeneveld, Dirk and Mitchell, Margaret and Gardner, Matt},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2104.08758},\n  year={2021}\n}\n%G \nAbstract: Researchers have proposed many methods for fair and robust machine learning, but comprehensive empirical evaluation of their subgroup robustness is lacking. In this work, we address this gap in the context of tabular data, where sensitive subgroups are clearly-defined, real-world fairness problems abound, and prior works often do not compare to state-of-the-art tree-based models as baselines. We conduct an empirical comparison of several previously-proposed methods for fair and robust learning alongside state-of-the-art tree-based methods and other baselines. Via experiments with more than $340{,}000$ model configurations on eight datasets, we show that tree-based methods have strong subgroup robustness, even when compared to robustness- and fairness-enhancing methods. Moreover, the best tree-based models tend to show good performance over a range of metrics, while robust or group-fair models can show brittleness, with significant performance differences across different metrics for a fixed model. We also demonstrate that tree-based models show less sensitivity to hyperparameter configurations, and are less costly to train. Our work suggests that tree-based ensemble models make an effective baseline for tabular data, and are a sensible default when subgroup robustness is desired.

Multicalibration guarantees meaningful (calibrated) predictions for every sub-population that can be identiﬁed within a speciﬁed class of computations. The speciﬁed class can be quite rich; in particular, it can contain many overlapping subgroups of a protected group. We demonstrate that in many settings this strong notion of protection from discrimination is provably attainable and aligned with the goal of accurate predictions. Along the way, we present algorithms for learning a multicalibrated predictor, study the computational complexity of this task, and illustrate tight connections to the agnostic learning model.\n@inproceedings{hebert2018multicalibration,\n  title={Multicalibration: Calibration for the (computationally-identifiable) masses},\n  author={H{\\'e}bert-Johnson, Ursula and Kim, Michael and Reingold, Omer and Rothblum, Guy},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},\n  pages={1939--1948},\n  year={2018},\n  organization={PMLR}\n}\n\nAbstract: Machine learning systems are deployed in critical settings, but they might fail in unexpected ways, impacting the accuracy of their predictions. Poisoning attacks against machine learning induce adversarial modification of data used by a machine learning algorithm to selectively change its output when it is deployed. In this work, we introduce a novel data poisoning attack called a subpopulation attack, which is particularly relevant when datasets are large and diverse. We design a modular framework for subpopulation attacks, instantiate it with different building blocks, and show that the attacks are effective for a variety of datasets and machine learning models. We further optimize the attacks in continuous domains using influence functions and gradient optimization methods. Compared to existing backdoor poisoning attacks, subpopulation attacks have the advantage of inducing misclassification in naturally distributed data points at inference time, making the attacks extremely stealthy. We also show that our attack strategy can be used to improve upon existing targeted attacks. We prove that, under some assumptions, subpopulation attacks are impossible to defend against, and empirically demonstrate the limitations of existing defenses against our attacks, highlighting the difficulty of protecting machine learning against this threat.\n@inproceedings{jagielski2021subpopulation,\n  title={Subpopulation data poisoning attacks},\n  author={Jagielski, Matthew and Severi, Giorgio and Pousette Harger, Niklas and Oprea, Alina},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2021 ACM SIGSAC Conference on Computer and Communications Security},\n  pages={3104--3122},\n  year={2021}\n}\nAbstract: In this paper, we take a first step towards answering the question of how to design fair machine learning algorithms that are robust to adversarial attacks. Using a minimax framework, we aim to design an adversarially robust fair regression model that achieves optimal performance in the presence of an attacker who is able to add a carefully designed adversarial data point to the dataset or perform a rank-one attack on the dataset. By solving the proposed nonsmooth nonconvex-nonconcave minimax problem, the optimal adversary as well as the robust fairness-aware regression model are obtained. For both synthetic data and real-world datasets, numerical results illustrate that the proposed adversarially robust fair models have better performance on poisoned datasets than other fair machine learning models in both prediction accuracy and group-based fairness measure.\n@article{jin2023fairness,\n  title={Fairness-aware Regression Robust to Adversarial Attacks},\n  author={Jin, Yulu and Lai, Lifeng},\n  journal={IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing},\n  year={2023},\n  publisher={IEEE}\n}\n% K \nAbstract: Prediction systems are successfully deployed in applications ranging from disease diagnosis, to predicting credit worthiness, to image recognition. Even when the overall accuracy is high, these systems may exhibit systematic biases that harm specific subpopulations; such biases may arise inadvertently due to underrepresentation in the data used to train a machine-learning model, or as the result of intentional malicious discrimination. We develop a rigorous framework of *multiaccuracy* auditing and post-processing to ensure accurate predictions across *identifiable subgroups*. Our algorithm, MULTIACCURACY-BOOST, works in any setting where we have black-box access to a predictor and a relatively small set of labeled data for auditing; importantly, this black-box framework allows for improved fairness and accountability of predictions, even when the predictor is minimally transparent. We prove that MULTIACCURACY-BOOST converges efficiently and show that if the initial model is accurate on an identifiable subgroup, then the post-processed model will be also. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach to improve the accuracy among minority subgroups in diverse applications (image classification, finance, population health). Interestingly, MULTIACCURACY-BOOST can improve subpopulation accuracy (e.g. for \"black women\") even when the sensitive features (e.g. \"race\", \"gender\") are not given to the algorithm explicitly.\n@inproceedings{kim2019multiaccuracy,\n  title={Multiaccuracy: Black-box post-processing for fairness in classification},\n  author={Kim, Michael P and Ghorbani, Amirata and Zou, James},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2019 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society},\n  pages={247--254},\n  year={2019}\n}\n% L\nAbstract: With the wide adoption of machine learning algorithms across various application domains, there is a growing interest in the fairness properties of such algorithms. The vast majority of the activity in the field of group fairness addresses disparities between predeﬁned groups based on protected features such as gender, age, and race, which need to be available at train, and often also at test, time. These approaches are static and retrospective, since algorithms designed to protect groups identified a priori cannot anticipate and protect the needs of different at-risk groups in the future. In this work we analyze the space of solutions for worst-case fairness beyond demographics, and propose Blind Pareto Fairness (BPF), a method that leverages no-regret dynamics to recover a fair minimax classiﬁer that reduces worst-case risk of any potential subgroup of sufﬁcient size, and guarantees that the remaining population receives the best possible level of service. BPF addresses fairness beyond demographics, that is, it does not rely on predeﬁned notions of at-risk groups, neither at train nor at test time. Our experimental results show that the proposed framework improves worst-case risk in multiple standard datasets, while simultaneously providing better levels of service for the remaining population, in comparison to competing methods.\n@inproceedings{martinez2021blind,\n  title={Blind pareto fairness and subgroup robustness},\n  author={Martinez, Natalia L and Bertran, Martin A and Papadaki, Afroditi and Rodrigues, Miguel and Sapiro, Guillermo},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},\n  pages={7492--7501},\n  year={2021},\n  organization={PMLR}\n}\n\n@article{meng2018statistical,\n  title={Statistical paradises and paradoxes in big data (i) law of large populations, big data paradox, and the 2016 US presidential election},\n  author={Meng, Xiao-Li},\n  journal={The Annals of Applied Statistics},\n  volume={12},\n  number={2},\n  pages={685--726},\n  year={2018},\n  publisher={JSTOR}\n}\n\nAbstract: Overparameterized neural networks can be highly accurate on average on an i.i.d. test set yet consistently fail on atypical groups of the data (e.g., by learning spurious correlations that hold on average but not in such groups). Distributionally robust optimization (DRO) allows us to learn models that instead minimize the worst-case training loss over a set of pre-defined groups. However, we find that naively applying group DRO to overparameterized neural networks fails: these models can perfectly fit the training data, and any model with vanishing average training loss also already has vanishing worst-case training loss. Instead, the poor worst-case performance arises from poor generalization on some groups. By coupling group DRO models with increased regularization---a stronger-than-typical L2 penalty or early stopping---we achieve substantially higher worst-group accuracies, with 10-40 percentage point improvements on a natural language inference task and two image tasks, while maintaining high average accuracies. Our results suggest that regularization is important for worst-group generalization in the overparameterized regime, even if it is not needed for average generalization. Finally, we introduce a stochastic optimization algorithm, with convergence guarantees, to efficiently train group DRO models.\n@article{sagawa2019distributionally,\n  title={Distributionally robust neural networks for group shifts: On the importance of regularization for worst-case generalization},\n  author={Sagawa, Shiori and Koh, Pang Wei and Hashimoto, Tatsunori B and Liang, Percy},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1911.08731},\n  year={2019}\n} \n@inproceedings{solans2020poisoning,\n  title={Poisoning attacks on algorithmic fairness},\n  author={Solans, David and Biggio, Battista and Castillo, Carlos},\n  booktitle={Joint European Conference on Machine Learning and Knowledge Discovery in Databases},\n  pages={162--177},\n  year={2020},\n  organization={Springer}\n}\n@inproceedings{van2022poisoning,\n  title={Poisoning attacks on fair machine learning},\n  author={Van, Minh-Hao and Du, Wei and Wu, Xintao and Lu, Aidong},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Database Systems for Advanced Applications},\n  pages={370--386},\n  year={2022},\n  organization={Springer}\n}\n\n%W \nThe above content represents the relevant literature in this field.

Traditional robust learning algorithms focus on overcoming arbitrary and indiscriminate data corruption, assuming that the corrupted data is uniformly distributed across the dataset. However, practical data collection processes often lead to patterns of data corruption that are localized to specific partitions of the training dataset. This localized corruption can disproportionately affect certain subpopulations, leading to unfair and inaccurate predictions. Existing methods for robust learning do not adequately address this issue, as they typically assume that the data corruption is uniformly distributed. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a new notion of robustness, termed 'multigroup robustness,' which ensures that the effects of data corruption on each subpopulation only degrade with the amount of corruption within that subpopulation. This approach provides more meaningful robustness guarantees than standard guarantees that are oblivious to the relationship between data corruption and affected subpopulations. The paper establishes a new connection between multigroup fairness and robustness, demonstrating that multigroup robust algorithms can provide meaningful robustness guarantees even when the data corruption is not uniformly distributed.\n\n## Main Idea\n\nThe paper introduces the concept of 'multigroup robustness,' a new notion of data-aware robustness that ensures subgroups do not suffer undue harm due to corruptions in unrelated data. The main idea is to develop algorithms that provide multigroup robustness guarantees, ensuring that the effects of dataset corruption on every subpopulation-of-interest are bounded by the amount of corruption within that subpopulation. The paper demonstrates that standard agnostic learning algorithms are not multigroup robust and proposes an efficient post-processing approach that can augment any existing learning algorithm to add multigroup robustness and multiaccuracy guarantees while preserving performance.\n\n## Interestingness\n\n8\n\n## Feasibility\n\n7\n\n## Novelty\n\n7\n\n```latex\n\\title{Multigroup Robustness}\n\n\\begin{abstract}\n    To address the shortcomings of real-world datasets, robust learning algorithms have been designed to overcome arbitrary and indiscriminate data corruption. However, practical processes of gathering data may lead to patterns of data corruption that are localized to specific partitions of the training dataset. Motivated by critical applications where the learned model is deployed to make predictions about people from a rich collection of overlapping subpopulations, we initiate the study of \\emph{multigroup robust} algorithms whose robustness guarantees for each subpopulation only degrade with the amount of data corruption \\emph{inside} that subpopulation. When the data corruption is not distributed uniformly over subpopulations, our algorithms provide more meaningful robustness guarantees than standard guarantees that are oblivious to how the data corruption and the affected subpopulations are related. Our techniques establish a new connection between multigroup fairness and robustness.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\n\nThe gap between standard distributional assumptions and practical dataset limitations has been well-studied in machine learning literature -- from unintended distribution shift to adversarially crafted data manipulations. \nCorresponding notions of \\emph{robustness} have been developed to reflect the goal of learning well in the presence of adversarially corrupted data, as well as attacks demonstrating that small amounts of corrupted data can seriously impact performance. \nWhile attacks that target specific subgroups have been proposed~\\citep{jagielski2021subpopulation}, they give the adversary the power to change any point in the dataset to achieve its goal--even the ability to modify seemingly unrelated points outside the subgroup of interest. While this is reasonable as a strong worst-case adversarial assumption, data corruption issues are often far more localized in reality. In surveys, response bias may compromise answers from certain subpopulations \\citep{meng2018statistical, bradley2021unrepresentative}. As another example, when amassing internet data for training large models, certain sources can be less trustworthy or more toxic than others~\\citep{dodge2021documenting}. Since limitations to datasets may be isolated to certain groups, it is important to develop a fine-grained notion of robustness that ensures groups do not suffer undue harm due to corruption in unrelated data.\n\\paragraph{A fine-grained robustness notion} We consider a new data-aware notion of robustness that we term \\emph{multigroup robustness}. At a high-level, a multigroup-robust learning algorithm guarantees that the effects of dataset corruption on every subpopulation-of-interest are bounded by the amount of corruption to data within that subpopulation (Figure~\\ref{fig:multigroup-robustness-diagram}).\n\nMore formally, we consider a binary-label learning problem where data from a domain $X$ labeled with $y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ is inputted into a deterministic learning algorithm $\\cA: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow [0, 1]^X$ that outputs a predictor $p \\in [0, 1]^X$. Given a set of subpopulations $\\cC \\subseteq 2^X$, we say that $\\cA$ is multigroup robust with respect to $\\cC$ if, given a dataset $S = \\{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)\\}$ where the $x_i$s are each drawn i.i.d. from some unknown distribution $\\cD_X$, given any other potentially corrupted dataset $S' = \\{(x_1', y_1'), ..., (x_m', y_m')\\}$, we can guarantee that the difference in the mean prediction of \\emph{every} group $C \\in \\cC$ is bounded by the amount of change to $C$ between $S$ and $S'$, i.e. \n\\[\\left|\\bE_{\\cD_X}[\\left(\\cA(S)(x) - \\cA(S')(x)\\right)\\one[x \\in C]]\\right| \\leq \\mathsf{dist}_C(S, S')\\]\nwhere $\\mathsf{dist}_C(S, S')$ is a measure of the changes to the set of points belonging to $C$ between $S$ and $S'$, which we will formalize in Section~\\ref{sec:multi-robust}. \n\nIntuitively, this definition asks that when the points from a group are unchanged or change very little in $S'$ (i.e. translating to a small $\\mathsf{dist}_C(S, S')$), then the average prediction outputted by $\\cA$ on that group should also not change by much, thus preserving the group's accuracy-in-expectation. %\n\\begin{figure}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{multi-group-robustness.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\small Intuitive illustration of multigroup robustness: for every group $C$, if points within the group are not modified, a multigroup robust algorithm produces a predictor that achieves marginal mean consistency with the clean data predictor (See Definition \\ref{def:multigroup-robust}).}\n    \\label{fig:multigroup-robustness-diagram}\n\\end{figure}\nIt is easy to construct algorithms that satisfy multigroup robustness, but are not very useful as learning algorithms; for example, the algorithm that always outputs the same predictor for any dataset. Thus, we will concentrate on the particular question of whether there exist efficient learning algorithms that provide multigroup robustness as well as an agnostic learning guarantee, i.e., that the predictor outputted by $\\cA$ performs at least as well as the best predictor from some benchmark set $\\cP \\subseteq [0, 1]^X$. \n\n\\paragraph{Standard algorithms are not multigroup robust} Classic agnostic learning algorithms such as empirical risk minimization over the benchmark class can fail to satisfy multigroup robustness even for extremely simple families of subpopulations. Consider as an example the benchmark class containing the all ones or all zeros predictors, $\\cP = \\{p_0, p_1\\}$, and a uniform distribution over $X$ where half of the points ($x \\in X_0$) are labeled with 0s, and half of the points ($x \\in X_1$) are labelled with ones. Given a sample from this half-and-half distribution, ERM will output the predictor matching the majority label in the dataset. However, because most datasets drawn will be close to half ones and half zeros, this means that only a tiny number of corrupted labels can drastically change the output from $p_0$ to $p_1$ or vice versa, impacting the predictions of a huge number of points despite not changing the overall accuracy by much. \n\nIn Section \\ref{sec:experiments}, we empirically demonstrate that several standard models for classification fail to preserve multigroup robustness under simple label-flipping and data addition attacks on the Adult Income Dataset. \n\n\\paragraph{Connections to multiaccuracy} In light of these successful attacks, new ideas are necessary to develop algorithms that can match the performance guarantees of standard learning approaches while being multigroup robust.\n\nWhen we only care about a small number of disjoint groups, a naive solution that provides multigroup robustness could be to simply train a separate model on each group's data. However, this approach becomes inefficient as we consider a growing number of possibly overlapping groups. Moreover, the individually trained models may lose out on the predictive power that could be gained from using the dataset as a whole. \n\nInstead, we turn to the notion of \\emph{multiaccuracy}, a learning objective originating in the algorithmic fairness literature that asks for a predictor to satisfy accuracy-in-expectation simultaneously on many groups~\\citep{hebert2018multicalibration, kim2019multiaccuracy}. In Section~\\ref{sec:ma-and-robust} we outline how multiaccuracy's rigorous group-level guarantees can connect to our goal of multigroup robustness. However, because standard multiaccuracy algorithms assume access to i.i.d. data, we encounter challenges to using them in our setting where due to adversarial corruption, we cannot assume data is i.i.d.. We demonstrate how to bypass these obstacles by making appropriate modifications to standard multiaccuracy algorithms, and present a set of sufficient conditions for algorithms that provably achieve multigroup robustness. In Section~\\ref{sec:lower-bd}, we supplement our results with a lower bound showing that multiaccuracy is a necessary property of any non-trivial algorithm that satisfies multigroup robustness. \n\n\\paragraph{Achieving multigroup robustness} With these sufficient conditions in hand, in Section~\\ref{sec:implementing} we present an efficient post-processing approach that can be used to augment any existing learning algorithm to add both multigroup robustness and multiaccuracy guarantees, while preserving the performance guarantees of the original learning algorithm.\n\nIn Section~\\ref{sec:experiments}, we supplement our theoretical results with experiments on real-world census datasets demonstrating that our post-processing approach can be added to existing learning algorithms to provide multigroup robustness protections without a drop in accuracy. \n\n\\subsection{Our Contributions}\nTo summarize, we list our main contributions below:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item Define a new notion of data-aware robustness, \\emph{multigroup robustness}, that ensures subgroups do not suffer undue harm due to corruptions in unrelated data (Section~\\ref{sec:multi-robust}).  \n    \\item Demonstrate general sufficient conditions for an algorithm to be multigroup robust by drawing connections to multiaccuracy (Section~\\ref{sec:ma-and-robust}), and show that multiaccuracy is necessary for non-trivial multigroup robust algorithms (Section~\\ref{sec:lower-bd}). \n    \\item Present an efficient post-processing algorithm that can provide an arbitrary learning algorithm with multigroup robustness guarantees while preserving performance (Section~\\ref{sec:implementing}). \n    \\item Empirically validate that standard learning algorithms are vulnerable to simple attacks on multigroup robustness, and that our postprocessing method successfully protects against these attacks while preserving accuracy (Section~\\ref{sec:experiments}). \n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\n\n\\paragraph{Fairness and Data Poisoning}\nPrior works have demonstrated that the fairness properties of machine learning models can be degraded by modifying small subsets of the training data~\\citep{solans2020poisoning, van2022poisoning, chai2023robust}. \\citet{jagielski2021subpopulation} show that subpopulations can be directly targeted in data poisoning attacks. Algorithms for finding fair predictors that are robust to data poisoning to any part of the dataset have also been proposed for regression~\\citep{jin2023fairness}. ``Subgroup robustness\" in recent literature refers to the performance of the worst~\\citep{martinez2021blind, gardner2022subgroup}. In distribution shift literature, ``subgroup robustness\" is used interchangeably with ``worst group robustness\" \\citep{sagawa2019distributionally}. In contrast, our definitions focus on how modifications to some groups in the training data can impact other unrelated groups. \n\n\\paragraph{Multiaccuracy and Multicalibration}\nMultiaccuracy and multicalibration are multigroup fairness notions that require a predictor to provide meaningful statistical guarantees (e.g., accuracy in expectation, calibration) on a large family of possibly overlapping subgroups of a population ~\\citep{tradeoff, hebert2018multicalibration, gerrymander, kim2019multiaccuracy}. \n\\citet{uniadapt} show that multicalibration can ensure a predictor's robustness against distribution shift, achieving \\emph{universal adaptability}. They focus on covariate shift while assuming the conditional distribution of $y$ given $x$ remains the same and assume that the covariate shift can be represented by a propensity score function from a given family. Our work considers general forms of data corruption, both in covariate $x$ and label $y$, and the corrupted data need not be i.i.d.\\ from any distribution.\n\n\\paragraph{Robust Statistics}\nAlgorithms for estimating a variety of statistical quantities on corrupted data have been studied extensively in the literature, where the quantities to estimate include mean \\citep{robust-mean-1,robust-mean-2}, covariance matrix \\citep{robust-mean-1,robust-gaussian}, principal components \\citep{robust-pca},  and beyond.\nIn the typical setup of robust statistics, the corrupted data is formed by modifying or hiding a significant fraction of an otherwise i.i.d.\\ dataset. The goal is to ensure that the estimation error is small relative to the fraction of corrupted data.\n\n\n\n\\section{Preliminaries and Notation}\n\n\nA \\emph{deterministic learning algorithm} is defined as any algorithm $\\cA: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow \\cP$ that takes a sample of data points $(x_1,y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n) \\in X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$ for any $n \\in \\bZ^+$ as input and outputs a predictor $p \\in \\cP$ where $X$ is a finite domain of points. \n\nGiven two datasets $S = \\{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)\\}$ and $S' = \\{(x_1', y_1'), ..., (x_m', y_m')\\}$, we use the notation $S \\Delta_X S'$ to denote a set containing the \\emph{symmetric difference} in terms of the multisets $\\{x_1, ..., x_n\\}$ and $\\{x_1', ..., x_m'\\}$. \n\nMore formally, because these datasets could have duplicates of certain $x$-values, we cannot use a standard set definition of symmetric difference. This can be thought of as reinterpretting each $\\{x_1, ..., x_n\\}$ as a map $\\mu$ from $X$ to $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$ where $\\mu(x)$ is equal to the number of times $x$ appears in the sample, $\\mu(x) = |\\{i\\in \\{1, \\ldots , n\\}: x_i = x\\}|$. Having similarly defined such a $\\mu'$ for $\\{x_1', ..., x_m'\\}$, the multiset symmetric difference of these two collections is defined as the map $\\mu_{\\Delta}$ such that for all $x \\in X$, $\\mu_{\\Delta}(x) = |\\mu(x) - \\mu'(x)|$.\n\nGiven two distributions $\\cD, \\cD'$ over a discrete domain $X$ and a subpopulation $C \\subseteq X$, we denote the statistical distance between $\\cD$ and $\\cD'$ restricted to $C$ as \n\\begin{align*}\n    &\\Delta_C(\\cD, \\cD') := \\\\\n    &\\sum_{x \\in C }\\left|\\Pr_{X \\sim \\cD}[X = x] - \\Pr_{X \\sim \\cD'}[X = x]\\right|.\n\\end{align*}\n\n\n\\section{Multigroup Robustness}\n\n\\label{sec:multi-robust}\nIn this section, we define our notion of \\emph{multigroup robustness}. We consider a setting where a learner is provided with a sample of binary-labelled data points $(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n) \\in \\mathcal{X} \\times \\{0, 1\\}$. %\nWe assume that the points could have been adversarially corrupted. \n\nWe consider two different levels of adversarial power. The strongest adversary we consider can make label-change adjustments to this dataset by replacing a point $(x, y)$ with a new $(x, y')$, as well as add or delete new points to the dataset. Our main definition is designed to protect against these strong data-dependent adversaries, and we state it formally below:\n\n\\begin{definition}[Binary-label Multigroup Robustness]\n    Let $\\cC$ be a subpopulation class consisting of subsets $C\\subseteq X$. For any $n \\in \\bZ^{+}, \\varepsilon > 0, \\delta \\in [0, 1]$,  we say that a deterministic learning algorithm $\\mathcal{A}: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow \\cP$ is \\emph{$(\\cC, n, \\varepsilon, \\delta)$-multigroup robust} if for every distribution $\\mathcal{D}_X$ over $X$, the following holds with probability at least $1 - \\delta$ over $X_n = (x_1, ..., x_n)$ drawn i.i.d. from $\\mathcal{D}_X$: for any $(y_1, ..., y_n) \\in \\{0, 1\\}^n$ and $(x_1', y_1'), ..., (x_m', y_m') \\in (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^m$, let $S$ and $S'$ denote the two samples $\\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i = 1}^n$ and $\\{(x_i', y_i')\\}_{i = 1}^m$, respectively.\n   \n    Defining $p := A(S)$ and $p' := A(S')$, we have \n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\label{eq:robust-label}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    &\\left|\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim \\mathcal{D}_X}[(p(x) - p'(x))\\one(x\\in C)]\\right| \\\\\n    &\\le \\frac 1 n \\left|\\sum_{i = 1}^n y_i \\one[x_i \\in C] - \\sum_{j = 1}^m y_j' \\one[x_j \\in C]\\right| \\\\\n    &\\,+ \\frac 1 n \\left|(S \\Delta_X S') \\cap C\\right|+ \\varepsilon\n    \\end{aligned}\n    \\end{equation}\n    for every $C\\in \\mathcal{C}$.\n    \\label{def:multigroup-robust}\n\\end{definition}\n\nWe highlight that our definition makes \\emph{no distributional assumptions} about the ground-truth $y$-values in the original dataset $S$, meaning that multigroup robustness implies a strong distribution-free robustness property that holds even when the original $y$-values were not i.i.d.. \n\nHere, the abstract $\\mathsf{dist}_C(S, S')$ used in the introduction is formalized to capture label flipping performed by the adversary (the first term) as well as addition and deletion of points (the second symmetric difference term). This means that this definition can also give a definition of robustness in settings where the adversary can only flip labels.\n\nWe also consider a weaker adversary that can only change the \\emph{distribution} the data is drawn from, and the particular training set is still drawn i.i.d. from that distribution:\n\n\\begin{definition}[Binary-label Multigroup Robustness to Distribution Shift]\n    Let $\\cC$ be a subpopulation class consisting of subsets $C\\subseteq X$. For any $n \\in \\bZ^+$, $\\varepsilon > 0$, $\\delta \\in [0, 1]$, we say that a deterministic learning algorithm $\\mathcal{A}: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow \\cP$ is \\emph{$(\\cC, n, \\varepsilon, \\delta)$-multigroup robust to distribution shift} if for any two distributions $\\cD, \\cD'$ over $X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$, the following holds with probability at least $1 - \\delta$ over $S = \\left((x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)\\right)$, $S' = \\left((x'_1, y_1'), ..., (x_n', y_n') \\right)$ drawn i.i.d. from $\\cD$ and $\\cD'$:\n   \n    Defining $p := A(S)$ and $p' := A(S')$, we have \n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\label{eq:robust-dist-shift}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n    &\\left|\\mathbb{E}_{x\\sim \\mathcal{D}_X}[(p(x) - p'(x))\\one(x\\in C)]\\right| \\\\\n    &\\le \\left|\\bE_{(x, y) \\sim \\cD}[y\\one[x \\in C]]- \\bE_{(x', y') \\sim \\cD'}[y'\\one[x' \\in C]]\\right|\\\\\n    &+\\Delta_C(\\cD_X, \\cD'_X) + \\varepsilon\n    \\end{aligned}\n    \\end{equation}\n    for every $C\\in \\mathcal{C}$.\n\\end{definition}\n\nNote that here, the $\\mathsf{dist}_C(S, S')$ bound has been replaced with a measure of the distance between the corrupted and uncorrupted distribution, however the first term still captures the amount of label shift while the second term speaks to the covariate shift in the corrupted distribution. \n\n\n\\section{Multigroup Robustness from Multiaccuracy}\n\nIn this section, we give principled conditions for algorithms that provably achieve multigroup robustness. Our proofs are largely inspired by previous algorithms for \\emph{multiaccuracy}. We identify several key challenges in using those algorithms in our setting with corrupted data, and address these challenges by making appropriate modifications.\n\nWe first introduce the definition of multiaccuracy~\\citep{hebert2018multicalibration}, a notion of algorithmic fairness that requires a predictor be accurate in expectation for every group in some collection of subgroups $C \\subseteq 2^X$. Formally, we define multiaccuracy as follows:\n\n\\begin{definition}[Multiaccuracy \\citep{hebert2018multicalibration}]\n    Let $\\cC$ be a subpopulation class consisting of subsets $C\\subseteq X$ and $\\cD$ some target distribution over $X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$. For $\\varepsilon > 0$, we say a predictor $p: X \\rightarrow [0, 1]$ is $(\\cC, \\varepsilon)$-multiaccurate (MA) on $\\cD$ if for every $C \\in \\cC$: \n    \\begin{equation}\n    \\label{eq:ma}\n        \\left|\\bE_{(x, y) \\sim D}\\left[(y - p(x))\\one[x \\in C]\\right]\\right| \\leq \\varepsilon.\n    \\end{equation}\n\\end{definition}\n\nThroughout the paper, it will be useful to talk about algorithms that provide multiaccuracy guarantees. We formally define such an algorithm as follows:\n\\begin{definition}[Multiaccurate Learning Algorithm]\n    Let $\\cC \\subseteq 2^X$ be a subpopulation class. Given $n \\in  \\bZ^+, \\varepsilon > 0$, $\\delta \\in [0, 1]$, we say that a deterministic learning algorithm $\\cA: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow [0,1]^X$ is $(\\cC, n, \\varepsilon, \\delta)$-multiaccurate if for any distribution $\\cD$ over $X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$, given $n$ i.i.d. data points $S = (x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ from $\\cD$, the predictor $\\cA(S)$ satisfies $(\\cC, \\varepsilon)$-MA on $\\cD$ with probability at least $1 - \\delta$. \n\\end{definition}\n\n\n\\subsection{Standard Multiaccuracy Gives Multigroup Robustness under Distribution Shift}\n\nWe begin by considering a setting where an adversary can only corrupt the data \\emph{distribution} rather than the sampled datapoints themselves, and show that in this setting, learners that output multiaccurate predictors with respect to a collection $\\cC$ are also multigroup robust to distribution shift with respect to $\\cC$. \n\nFor ease of notation, for a given distribution $\\cD$, predictor $p$, and subpopulation $C \\subseteq X$ we denote $\\mae_{\\cD}(p, C) := \\bE_{(x, y) \\sim \\cD}[(y - p(x))\\one[x \\in C]]$. \n\n\\begin{lemma}[Robustness from MA]\\label{lem:ma-rob}\nGiven two distributions $\\cD, \\cD'$ over $X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$ and a collection of subsets $\\cC \\subseteq 2^X$, let $p$ and $p'$ be $(\\cC, \\varepsilon)$-MA predictors with respect to $\\cD$ and $\\cD'$, respectively. Then it holds that for all $C \\in \\cC$,\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:ma-lemma}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n        &\\left|\\bE_{\\cD}[(p(x) - p'(x))\\one[x \\in C]]\\right| \\\\&\\leq\n        \\left| \\mae_{\\cD}(p', C) - \\mae_{\\cD'}(p', C)\\right|+ 2\\varepsilon.\n    \\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\n\\end{lemma}\n\nIntuitively, the left-hand-side of equation~\\ref{eq:ma-lemma} already bears resemblance to a multigroup robustness statement with respect to $p$ and $p'$. By reinterpretting the upper bound, we can show that multiaccurate learners provide multigroup robustness to distribution shift: \n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:ma-robust-dist-shift}\n    Let $\\cC \\subseteq 2^X$ be a collection of subpopulations and let $\\cA:(X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^n \\rightarrow [0,1]^X$ be a deterministic learning algorithm satisfying $(\\cC, n, \\epsilon, \\delta)$-MA. Then, $\\cA$ is also $(\\cC, n, 2\\varepsilon, 2\\delta)$-multigroup robust to distribution shift. \n\\end{lemma}\n\n\\subsection{Leveraging Uniform Convergence for Stronger Robustness}\n\nIn total, we have shown so far that learning algorithms for multiaccuracy such as those of~\\citep{hebert2018multicalibration, kim2019multiaccuracy} \\emph{additionally} give out-of-the-box multigroup robustness guarantees against weak adversaries that can corrupt the data distribution. \nThis result relies on the key assumption that while the corrupted distribution may be arbitrarily warped compared to the original distribution, we can still assume that the training data is drawn i.i.d. from the corrupted distribution. This is a key property that allows us to apply multiaccuracy algorithms that assume access to an i.i.d. datasource. \n\nMoving beyond distributional shifts, we are also interested in stronger adversaries that can directly corrupt a data sample either through label change or addition/deletion of points. In the presence of these stronger adversaries, we can no longer assume access to an ``clean'' i.i.d. datasource. \nIn the absence of i.i.d. data, we can still work with the empirical distribution: the uniform distribution over the data points. However, because multigroup robustness is a statement about the predictor similarity over the \\emph{true marginal distribution $D_X$}, it's not clear whether relying on the corrupted empirical distribution alone can give us these distributional guarantees necessary for robustness. \n\nDespite this obstacle, our main result shows that by leveraging an additional uniform-convergence assumption, we can in fact achieve multigroup robustness against strong dataset-dependent adversaries for any algorithm that guarantees multiaccuracy on the empirical distribution. \nOur analysis for handling adversarially corrupted data differs from typical analyses where the uniform convergence assumption is applied to a learning algorithm with i.i.d.\\ input data (see \\Cref{rem:uniform-cvg}).\n\n\nWe begin by showing in Lemma~\\ref{lem:ma-ptwise-rob} that guaranteeing empirical multiaccuracy already yields a guarantee of predictor-closeness when measured over the empirical distribution of the uncorrupted dataset. We formally define an empirically robust learning algorithm as follows:\n\n\\begin{definition}[Empirically Multiaccurate Learning Algorithm]\\label{def:emp-ma}\n    Let $\\cC$ be a subpopulation class consisting of subsets $C \\subseteq X$. Given $\\varepsilon > 0$, we say that a deterministic learning algorithm $\\cA: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow [0,1]^X$ is $(\\cC, \\varepsilon)$-empirically-multiaccurate if when given as input data points $S = (x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ from $X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$ for any $n \\in \\bZ^+$, the predictor $p:= \\cA(S)$ satisfies \n    \\[\\left|\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^n (y_i - p(x_i))\\one[x_i \\in C]\\right| \\leq \\varepsilon\\]\n    for all $C \\in \\cC$. \n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{lemma}[Pointwise Robustness from Empirical MA]\\label{lem:ma-ptwise-rob}\n    Given two datasets $S = \\{(x_i, y_i)\\}_{i = 1}^n$, $S' = \\{(x_j', y_j')\\}_{j = 1}^m$ from $X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$ and a collection of subsets $\\cC$, let $p$ and $p'$ be $(\\cC, \\varepsilon)$-MA and $(\\cC, \\varepsilon')$-MA predictors with respect to $\\mathsf{Uni}(S)$ and $\\mathsf{Uni}(S')$, respectively. Then it holds that for all $C \\in \\cC$, \n    \\begin{equation}\\label{eq:pointwise-rob-lem}\n    \\begin{aligned}\n        &\\left|\\bE_{(x, y) \\sim \\mathsf{Uni}(S)}[(p'(x) - p(x))\\one[x \\in C]]\\right| \\\\\n        &\\leq\n        \\frac{1}{n}\\left|\\sum_{(x, y) \\in S}y \\one[x \\in C] - \\sum_{(x', y') \\in S'}y'\\one[x' \\in C]\\right|\\\\\n        &\\quad + \\frac{1}{n}|(S \\Delta_X S')\\cap C| + \\varepsilon + \\frac{m}{n}\\varepsilon'.\n    \\end{aligned}\n    \\end{equation}\n\\end{lemma}\n\nWhile the right side of the statement of Lemma~\\ref{eq:pointwise-rob-lem} matches the definition of multigroup robustness, the left side is still an expectation over the empirical distribution $\\mathsf{Uni}(S)$ rather than the uncorrupted target distribution $\\cD_X$. This means that to show that multigroup robustness holds, it suffices to show that the empirical quantity $\\left|\\bE_{(x, y) \\sim \\mathsf{Uni}(S)}[(p'(x) - p(x))\\one[x \\in C]]\\right|$ is close to its population limit, $\\left|\\bE_{x \\sim D_x}[(p'(x) - p(x))\\one[x \\in C]]\\right|$, for all $C \\in \\cC$. \n\nOur main result uses this reasoning to show that a learning algorithm that outputs a predictor multiaccurate with respect to the empirical distribution satisfies multigroup robustness whenever we can guarantee \\emph{uniform convergence} over all possible outputted predictors and subpopulations (See Definition~\\ref{def:uniform-cvg} for a formal definition). \nWe additionally show that under this assumption we can guarantee the outputted predictor is multiaccurate with respect to the target distribution when the learning algorithm is given uncorrupted i.i.d. data (Theorem~\\ref{thm:general-robustness-and-ma}). \n\n\\begin{definition}\\label{def:uniform-cvg}\n    Let $\\cC \\subseteq 2^X$ be a class of subpopulations, and let $\\cP \\subseteq [0, 1]^X$ be a family of predictors. We say that $\\cP$ satisfies $(\\cC, n, \\varepsilon, \\delta)$-\\emph{uniform convergence} if for any distribution $\\cD$ over $X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$, we are guaranteed that with probability at least $1 - \\delta$ over the randomness of datapoints $(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)$ drawn i.i.d. from $\\cD$, we are guaranteed that the following inequalities hold for all $p \\in \\cP$ and $C \\in \\cC$:\n    \\begin{align}\n    \\left|\\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n p(x_i)\\one(x_i\\in C) - \\bE_\\cD [p(x)\\one(x\\in C)]\\right| & \\le \\varepsilon,\\\\\n    \\left|\\frac 1n \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\one(x_i\\in C) - \\bE_\\cD [y\\one(x\\in C)]\\right| & \\le \\varepsilon.\n    \\end{align}\n\\end{definition}\n\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:general-robustness-and-ma}\nLet $\\cA: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow \\cP$ be a deterministic learning algorithm that outputs predictors from the family $\\cP \\subseteq [0,1]^X$. For a family of subpopulations $\\cC \\subseteq 2^X$, suppose that $\\cA$ satisfies empirical $(\\cC, \\varepsilon_1)$-multiaccuracy\nand additionally suppose that $\\cP$ satisfies $(\\cC, n, \\varepsilon_2, \\delta_2)$-uniform convergence. Then, $\\cA$ is $(\\cC, n, \\left(1 + \\frac{m}{n}\\right)\\varepsilon_1 + 2\\varepsilon_2, \\delta_2)$-multigroup robust as well as $(\\cC, n, \\varepsilon_1 + 2\\varepsilon_2, \\delta_2)$-multiaccurate.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{remark}[Strong use of uniform convergence]\\label{rem:uniform-cvg}\nUniform convergence is a standard technique for establishing the generalization of a learning algorithm and is typically applied to algorithms given uncorrupted, i.i.d. training data. The important difference in our approach is that we apply uniform convergence to algorithms whose input data is adversarially corrupted and cannot be treated as i.i.d.\\ from any distribution. In our setting, i.i.d.\\ data is first given to an \\emph{unrestricted} adversary to produce corrupted data, which is then given to the learning algorithm whose output model is \\emph{restricted} to a class. Since we do not restrict the behavior of the adversary, our analysis makes a stronger use of uniform convergence  than typical analyses. \n\n\\end{remark}\n\\subsection{Lower Bounds}\\label{sec:lower-bd}\n\\begin{theorem}[Lower Bound]\\label{thm:lower-bound}\nLet $\\cC$ be a class of subpopulations, $\\cP \\subseteq [0, 1]^X$ a family of predictors containing the all ones predictor $p(x) = 1$ for all $x \\in X$, and $\\cA: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\}^*) \\rightarrow \\cP$ a deterministic learning algorithm.

We now show that multigroup robustness can be achieved efficiently in parallel with standard accuracy objectives. In particular, we present a post-processing procedure that can convert any black-box learning algorithm into a multigroup robust learning algorithm that minimizes $\\ell_2$ error.\n\n\\subsection{Post-processing Approach}\n\nWe consider a setting where we are given access to an arbitrary deterministic learning algorithm $\\cA: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow [0, 1]^X$. We will demonstrate how to post-process this algorithm to produce a new algorithm $\\mathsf{PP}_{\\cA}: (X \\times\\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow [0, 1]^X$ (Algorithm~\\ref{alg:ma-empirical}) that provides comparable performance to that of $\\cA$ in terms of $\\ell_2$ error while also satisfying multigroup robustness. We present our post-processing approach in Algorithm~\\ref{alg:ma-empirical}.\n\n\\begin{algorithm}\n    \\caption{Multiaccuracy Boost on Empirical Distribution}\n    \\label{alg:ma-empirical}\n    \\begin{algorithmic}\n       \\STATE {\\bfseries Parameters: }$n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\ge 0}$, $\\varepsilon \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$, $\\mathcal{C} \\subseteq \\{0, 1\\}^X$\n       \\STATE {\\bfseries Input: }data points $(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n) \\in X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$, learning algorithm $\\cA:\\{0, 1\\}^n \\rightarrow [0, 1]^X$\n       \\STATE {\\bfseries Output: }predictor $p:X\\rightarrow[0,1]$\n\n       \\STATE {\\bfseries Step 1: Training}\n       \\STATE  initialize $p \\leftarrow \\cA((x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n))$\n\n       \\STATE {\\bfseries Step 2: Post-processing}\n       \\WHILE{$\\exists C \\in \\mathcal{C}$ s.t. $|\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i = 1}^n(p(x_i) - y_i)\\one(x_i \\in C)| > \\varepsilon$}\n            \\STATE $v_C := \\mathsf{sgn}\\left(\\sum_{i = 1}^n (p(x_i) - y_i)\\one(x_i \\in C)\\right)$\n            \\FORALL{$x \\in C$}\n                \\STATE $p(x) \\leftarrow p(x) - v_C\\epsilon$\n                \\STATE $p(x) \\leftarrow \\max \\{0, \\min\\{p(x), 1\\}\\}$\n            \\ENDFOR\n        \\ENDWHILE\n\n        \\STATE {\\bfseries Return: }$p$\n    \\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\nAlgorithm~\\ref{alg:ma-empirical} uses an iterative auditing approach to bring the predictor closer to being multiaccurate with each iteration of the While loop in Step 2. This is similar to standard algorithms for multiaccuracy presented in the \nliterature~\\citep{hebert2018multicalibration, kim2019multiaccuracy}, but is differentiated in that it audits using \\emph{the entire dataset} at each iteration, rather than sampling fresh data for each update step. This alteration is necessary in order to guarantee we achieve empirical\nmultiaccuracy.\nIt follows immediately from the definition of Algorithm~\\ref{alg:ma-empirical} that it outputs an empirically multiaccurate predictor (See Lemma~\\ref{lem:stopping-condition}). We can also show that the algorithm is guaranteed to terminate in a bounded number of steps, and thus the class of predictors it can output is also bounded, giving us a uniform convergence result that we state formally and prove in Lemma~\\ref{lem:uniform-convergence}.\n\nLemmas~\\ref{lem:stopping-condition} and \\ref{lem:uniform-convergence} give us the two sufficient conditions for multigroup robustness described in Section~\\ref{sec:multi-robust} (empirical multiaccuracy and uniform convergence, respectively). Thus, we can show that $\\mathsf{PP}_{\\cA}$ satisfies multigroup-robustness and multiaccuracy:\n\n\\begin{theorem}\n    Let $\\cA: (X \\times \\{0, 1\\})^* \\rightarrow \\cP$ be a deterministic learning algorithm that is guaranteed to output from a finite set of predictors $\\cP \\subseteq [0, 1]^X$. Let $\\mathsf{PP}_{\\cA}$ be the algorithm defined by Algorithm~\\ref{alg:ma-empirical} on input $\\cA$ with input parameter $\\epsilon>0$. Then, for any $\\delta \\in [0, 1]$, $\\mathsf{PP}_{\\cA}$ satisfies $(\\cC, n, (3 + \\frac{m}{n})\\epsilon, \\delta)$-multigroup robustness and $(\\cC, n, 3\\epsilon, \\delta)$-multiaccuracy for any $n \\geq \\frac{\\log(|\\cP|(2|\\cC|)^{1/\\epsilon^2 + 1}/\\delta)}{2\\epsilon^2}$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\\begin{proof}\n    The theorem follows immediately by combining Theorem~\\ref{thm:general-robustness-and-ma} with Lemmas~\\ref{lem:stopping-condition} and \\ref{lem:uniform-convergence}.\n\\end{proof}\n\n\\subsection{Loss Minimization Guarantee}\n\nLastly, we show that the post-processed predictor is not much worse than the initial predictor outputted by the original learning algorithm. Intuitively, this result follows from Lemma~\\ref{lem:l2-dec}, which tells us that each iteration of the post-processing step decreases the predictor's empirical $\\ell_2$-loss by at least $\\epsilon^2$. With this fact in hand, we can appeal to uniform convergence to show that the loss decrease also generalizes to the entire distribution. \n\n\\begin{corollary}[Corollary to Theorem~\\ref{thm:loss-min}]\n    Let $\\cA:(X \\times\\{0, 1\\}^*) \\rightarrow \\cP$ be a deterministic learning algorithm that is guaranteed to output from a finite set of predictors $\\cP \\subseteq [0, 1]^X$. Let $\\mathsf{PP}_{\\cA}$ be the algorithm defined by Algorithm~\\ref{alg:ma-empirical} on input $\\cA$ with parameter $\\epsilon > 0$. Given a sample $S = \\{(x_1, y_1), ..., (x_n, y_n)\\}$ drawn i.i.d. from some distribution $\\cD$ over $X \\times \\{0, 1\\}$, let $p := \\cA(S)$ be the predictor output by $\\cA$ on $S$, and let $p_{\\mathsf{PP}} := \\mathsf{PP}_{\\cA}$ be the predictor output after post-processing. Then, for any $\\delta \\in [0, 1]$ and $n \\geq \\frac{\\log(|\\cP|(2|\\cC|)^{1/\\epsilon^2})}{2\\epsilon^2}$, we are guaranteed that with probability at least $1 - \\delta$\n    \\[\\bE_{\\cD}[(y - p_{\\mathsf{PP}}(x))^2] \\leq \\bE_{\\cD}[(y - p(x))^2] + 2\\epsilon.\\]\n\\end{corollary}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\textwidth]{label_shift.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\small The effect of label change (0 to 1) in White male group on other subpopulations.

This property is often guaranteed for multicalibration algorithms (see e.g., \\Cref{lem:uniform-convergence}).\\footnote{While our results are stated for multiaccuracy, they can be applied to multicalibration with appropriate modifications.} At a high level, previous multicalibration algorithms are analogous to the original boosting algorithm \\citep{weak}, whereas ours are analogous to AdaBoost algorithm \\citep{adaboost}. Using this alternative approach is crucial for our robustness guarantees.\n\\paragraph{Omniprediction.} Recent work has explored the concept of an \\emph{omnipredictor}--a predictor whose predictions can be post-processed to select near-optimal actions for a large variety of loss functions, rather than needing to train the predictor to optimize for a specific loss function~\\citep{gopalan2022omnipredictors, gopalan2023loss, hu2023omnipredictors, garg2024oracle}. It is known that multicalibration (a strengthening of multiaccuracy) is a sufficient condition for omniprediction. We note that our algorithm can be extended to the setting of multicalibration with appropriate modifications, which would provide a multigroup robust omniprediction algorithm that could provide accuracy guarantees beyond $\\ell_2$ loss. However, we note that while such an algorithm would be multigroup robust with respect to the outputted predictor, it is not clear if it would be multigroup robust with respect to the post-processed optimal actions. We leave this as a direction for future work. \n\\paragraph{Postprocessing on Fresh Data.} While we envision using our post-processing step as part of an end-to-end learning pipeline and thus use the original data during post-processing, in certain settings, the original learning algorithm's training data may be unavailable and the post-processing step might need to use fresh data. In this case, we would continue to preserve accuracy guarantees, but could only guarantee multigroup robustness against strong adversaries with respect to the dataset used for post-processing. In the weaker distribution shift setting, fresh data for post-processing is enough to ensure overall multigroup robustness assuming that the distribution of the post-processing set is the same as that of the training data. \n\n\n\n```\n\n## Experimental Setup\n\n```json\n[{\"name\": \"Empirical Demonstration of Standard Models' Vulnerability\", \"description\": \"This experiment aims to empirically demonstrate that several standard models for classification fail to preserve multigroup robustness under simple label-flipping and data addition attacks on the Adult Income Dataset.

Figure \\ref{fig:type1-label-shift} shows the effect of randomly shifting labels in the White male group on three other groups that are unchanged: White female, Black or African American Male and Female subgroups. For Logistic Regression, the base classifier \\textsc{Clf}, results in increased bias as the noise rate increases while the \\textsc{Clf-PP} predictor retains a low multi-accuracy error while maintaining similar accuracy to the original model. A similar phenomenon is observed in the neural network (MLP) where \\textsc{Clf-PP} remains multigroup robust. \n\n\\paragraph{Addition/Deletion}\nWe also demonstrate the robustness of Algorithm \\ref{alg:ma-empirical} through to additional data points designed to attack a specific target group. We employ a similar strategy as prior work designing subpopulation attacks~\\citep{jagielski2021subpopulation} with the additional constraint that only data points outside of the target group can be used to create the poisoning dataset. To find data points to add that would affect the target group, we first cluster data points in a held-out set (not used for training or testing) using K-means. For each cluster where the target subgroup appears, we shift the labels of the of points we are allowed to modify and add them to the training data. The amount of noise in this attack is scaled by how many times the identified data points are replicated before being added to the poisoned dataset. In Figure \\ref{fig:type2-addition}, we see that even at low levels of noise (i.e., poisoned points are replicated once or twice), the Logistic Regression and Neural Network (MLP) classifiers exhibit worsened multi-accuracy error while their post-processed counterparts (\\textsc{Clf-PP}) exhibit consistently low $\\mae$ without lower accuracy. \n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion and Future Work}\n\nMotivated by practical scenarios where subgroups in datasets may be corrupted, we present \\emph{multigroup robustness} and provide an algorithm that gives meaningful robustness guarantees. Moreover, we empirically show that while standard models allow unrelated groups to suffer under data poisoning attacks, our algorithm applied to post-processing these predictors using the same poisoned data achieves multigroup robustness. While our analysis was limited to the binary setting, notions of multigroup robustness in the multi-class setting are an exciting direction for future work.\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n"

It is a fundamental tool in machine learning that is commonly used for exploratory analysis and for reducing the computational resources required to handle large datasets. For comprehensive descriptions of different clustering methods and their applications, we refer to \\citep{Jain:1999,HMMR15}. \n\nOne important type of clustering is hierarchical clustering.\nGiven a set  of $n$ points, a hierarchical clustering is a sequence of\nclusterings $({\\cal C}^0,{\\cal C}^{1},\\ldots,\\C^{n-1})$,\nwhere ${\\cal C}^0$ is a clustering with $n$ unitary clusters, \neach of them corresponding to one of the $n$ points,\nand  ${\\cal C}^{i}$, for $i \\ge 1$, is obtained from ${\\cal C}^{i-1}$ \n by replacing two clusters of ${\\cal C}^{i-1}$ with their union.\nHierarchical clustering algorithms are implemented in widely used machine learning libraries such as {\\tt scipy} and they have applications in many contexts such as in the study of evolution through phylogenetic trees \\citep{b684a7bdefca4810bdaaf10bf8196c46}. \n\nThere is a significant literature on hierarchical clustering; for  good surveys we refer to\n\\citep{10.1093/comjnl/26.4.354,DBLP:journals/widm/MurtaghC12}.\nWith regards to more theoretical work, one important line of research consists of designing algorithms for hierarchical clustering\n with provable guarantees for natural optimization criteria such as cluster diameter and the sum of quadratic errors \\citep{DASGUPTA2005555,DBLP:journals/siamcomp/CharikarCFM04,DBLP:journals/siamcomp/LinNRW10,DBLP:conf/esa/ArutyunovaR22}.\nAnother relevant line aims\nto understand the theoretical properties (e.g. approximation guarantees)\nof algorithms widely used in practice, such as linkage methods\n\\citep{DASGUPTA2005555,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1012-3697,DBLP:conf/esa/GrosswendtR15,arutyunova_et_al:LIPIcs.APPROX/RANDOM.2021.18,DBLP:conf/soda/GrosswendtRS19}.\n\nHere, we contribute to this second line of research by\n giving new and improved analysis for the\n  \\complink  \\,\\citep{DBLP:journals/jmlr/AckermanB16}\n and also for a class of linkage methods\n that includes \n\\avglink\\, \\citep{DBLP:journals/jmlr/AckermanB16} and \\minimax \\, \\citep{BienTib2011}.\n \n\n\n \n \n\\subsection{Our Results}\nLet  $({\\cal X},dist)$ be a metric space, where ${\\cal X}$ is a set of $n$ points.\nThe diameter $\\diamset(S)$ of a set of points $S$ is  given by\n$\\diamset(S)=\\max\\{dist(x,y)|x,y \\in S\\}$.\nA \\emph{$k$-clustering} $\\C=\\{ C_i | 1 \\le i \\le k \\}$ is a partition of ${\\cal X}$ into $k$ groups.

                "A Better Bound for Complete-Link",
                "\\label{sec:better-bound}\nOne of the  key ideas of the approach presented in the previous section\nis to use the diameter of a regular family  to bound\nthe diameter of any cluster that is created.\nIndeed, if at the beginning of  an iteration, there is a family $F$ with two\nclusters, then the diameter of the cluster created at this iteration  is\nat most $\\diamset(F)$. However, Algorithm \\ref{alg:FamilyGeneration1} and its analysis do not\n take full advantage of this idea. As an example, let us assume that \n at the beginning of some \niteration there are 3 regular families, say $F$, $F'$ and $F''$, \nwith $\\diamset(F) \\ge \\diamset(F') \\ge \\diamset(F'')$,\nall of them corresponding to roots of $D$. \nIf a cluster in $F$ is merged with one in $F'$ (case (b) of Algorithm \\ref{alg:FamilyGeneration1}) then \na new family is created and its diameter is used as a bound, which is \nnot desirable since it is larger than\nthat of $F''$.\n\nTo obtain a better bound, instead of creating a new family whenever\nclusters from different families, say $F$ and $F'$, are merged, we create an\nedge between $F$ and $F'$ in a dynamic graph $G$ that keeps track of the merges\namong different families. When a connected component of $G$ has\nat most one family that can still be used as a bounding tool, we\nreplace all families in the component with a new family.\nThe motivation for doing so  is to use a better bound\nas much as possible, which contrasts with the approach taken by \nAlgorithm \\ref{alg:FamilyGeneration1}.\n  \nThis new approach is presented in Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2}. \n The algorithm  maintains  a set of excluded clusters $\\Ex$;\n clusters in this set are \n never included in the families that the algorithm creates (line \\ref{line:FC-creation}).\nMoreover, it maintains\nboth a direct forest $D$ and\na graph $G$. \nEach  node of $G$ as well as each node of $D$ is associated with a family; an edge is created in $G$ between nodes/families $F$ and $F'$ if \\complink  \\, merges two clusters $g \\notin \\Ex$ and  $g' \\notin \\Ex$ \nthat, respectively, contain\npoints from  $\\Pts(F)$ and $\\Pts(F')$. \nThe graph and the forest may be updated at each iteration of Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2}.\n\nBefore giving extra details regarding Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2}, we need to explain the concept of\na pure cluster. A family $F$  is created (lines \\ref{line:initial-families} and  \\ref{line:FC-creation})\nby specifying the clusters that it contains.\n If a cluster $g$ is one of them,\n we say that $g$ is {\\em pure} w.r.t. $F$ or, alternatively,\n $F$ has the pure cluster $g$.\nMoreover, if a cluster $g$ is obtained by merging\ntwo clusters that are pure with respect to some family $F$\nthen $g$ is also pure w.r.t.  $F$. If a cluster is not\npure w.r.t. any family, we say that it is {\\em non-pure}.  \nWe use $\\pure_t(F)$ to denote the number of pure clusters w.r.t. $F$ that\nbelong to $\\C^t$.\nNote that if $pure_{t-1}(F) \\ge 2$\nthen  $\\diamset(F)$ is an upper bound on the diameter\nof the cluster that is created at iteration $t$, so that\nfamilies with at least two pure clusters play a role similar\nto that of regular families in the analysis of Algorithm \\ref{alg:FamilyGeneration1}.\n\nIn contrast to Algorithm \\ref{alg:FamilyGeneration1},\nwhere each cluster belongs to one family,\nin Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2} every cluster \nthat does not belong to $\\Ex$ is either pure w.r.t. some family $F$ in $G$ \n(this would be equivalent of belonging to $F$) or it is contained\nin $ \\bigcup_{H \\in C} \\Pts(H)$ for some connected component $C$ in $G$. \nFor our analysis, we note that $\\Pts(F)$, $\\diamset(F)$ and $|F|$ refer,\nrespectively, to the set of points of $F$, the diameter of $F$\nand the number of clusters in $F$ {\\bf at the moment} that $F$ is created. \n\nThe algorithm starts (lines \\ref{line:t0}-\\ref{line:end-init}) with the initialization\nof the set $\\Ex$, the forest $D$ and the graph $G$.\nThen, in the  loop, two clusters are merged\nfollowing the \\complink \\, rule.\n  In terms of the graph, each merge may lead to the\n  addition of new edges and also to the\nunion of two connected components.\nIn terms of the families,\na merge can reduce by one unit the number of\npure clusters of one or two families.\nIf this happens pure clusters \nmay be added to set $\\Ex$ (lines \\ref{line:addLr1} and \\ref{line:addLr2}) and this may also trigger one of the cases (a), (b) or (c).\nIf either (a) or (b) occurs a new family $F_C$, associated with the component $C$\nthat satisfies one of these cases, is created\nto replace all families in $C$ (line \\ref{line:FC-creation}).\nIf case (c) occurs the component $C$ is removed from $G$.\nThe main loop was carefully designed to guarantee that (i) at the beginning of each iteration there exists a family that has at least two pure clusters associated with it and (ii)  the diameter of  family $F_C$\n is slightly smaller than twice the sum of the diameters of the families in the \n underlying connected component $C$. \n\\begin{algorithm*}\n\\small\n\n  \\caption{{\\sc Tighter Bound for \\complink}  }\n   \\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\n\\STATE $\\C^{0} \\gets$ clustering with $n$ unitary clusters, each one containing a point of\n${\\cal X}$ \\label{line:t0} \\\\\n\n\\STATE $(T^*_1,\\ldots,T^*_k) \\gets$ a $k$-clustering with maximum diameter equal to \\OPTDIMK  \\\\\n\\STATE  For each $i$, with $|T^*_i| > 1$,  $F_i \\gets \\{ \\{x\\} | x \\in T^*_i\\}$  \\label{line:initial-families}\\\\\n\n\n\\STATE Create a forest $D$ with no edges and  vertex set  $\\{F_i|T^*_i \\mbox{ has  at least two points}\\}$  \\\\\n\n\\STATE Create a graph $G$ with no edges and  vertex set  $\\{F_i|T^*_i \\mbox{ has  at least two points}\\}$     \\label{line:end-init} \\\\\n\\STATE $\\Ex \\gets $ set of clusters $T^*_i$ with exactly one point  \\label{line:test} \\\\\n\n\\STATE  {\\bf For} $t:= 1 \\ldots n-k$  \\\\\n\\STATE\t\\hspace{0.5cm} $(g,g') \\gets$ next clusters to be merged by {\\tt Complete-Link} \\\\\n\n\\STATE\t\\hspace{0.5cm} $\\C^{t} \\gets \\C^{t-1} \\cup \\{g \\cup g'\\} -

We present an overview of the proof\n\nfull proof. \n\\begin{lemma} \n For $t \\le n-k$, at the beginning of iteration $t$ of Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2},\n each connected component $C$ of $G$ satisfies\none of the following properties:\n(i) $|C|=1$ and the only family of $C$ has at least\ntwo pure clusters  or (ii) $|C|>1$ and there exist  two  families in $C$\nsuch that\neach of them has at least two pure clusters.\n\\label{lem:2pureclusters}\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]\nWe first argue that if all components of $G$\nsatisfy the desired properties at the beginning of iteration $t$\nthen all components of $G$ also satisfy them at the beginning of  iteration $t+1$.\nNext, we argue that  $G$ does not have all its nodes removed\nat some iteration.\n\nAt the beginning of Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2}, all  the components in $G$ satisfy \nproperty (i) because, by line \\ref{line:end-init}, all the families $F_i$ in $G$ have  \nat least two clusters and all their clusters are pure. \n\nWhen two clusters are merged at some iteration $t$, then at most two\ndistinct families have their number of pure clusters\ndecreased by one unit (Proposition \\ref{prop:families-evol}).  As a result, one connected component, say $C$, \nwhere these families lie in the updated graph may not respect the conditions of the lemma anymore.\nHowever, in this case, we can show that either (a), (b) or (c) occurs. In the\ncase (c), the component  $C$ is removed from $G$, so we do not have a problem\nwith $C$ at the next iteration. If either (a) or (b) occurs,\n$C$ is replaced with a new component that only has the family $F_C$. \nProposition \\ref{prop:FC} shows \nthat there are two pure clusters w.r.t. $F_C$,  so this new component satisfies the condition (i). \n\nNow, assume that $G$ has all its nodes removed at\nsome iteration $t'$.\nIt is possible to conclude that at the beginning of $t'$,  $G$ has just one component, this component has just one family and this family has exactly 2 pure clusters. This together with the fact that at most $k$ clusters\nare added to $\\Ex$ (Proposition \\ref{prop:L-Bound}) allows the conclusion that there are at most $k+1$ clusters at the beginning of $t'$. But this is not a problem since $t' \\ge n-k$ in this case. \n\\end{proof}\n\nNow, we bound the diameter of the families $F_C$ at the moment they are created by Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2}.\nTo this end, we define a spanning tree $T_C$ for\n $C$ and use its paths to bound the diameter of $F_C$.\n Consider the sequence\nof merges $m_1,\\ldots,m_{|C|-1}$, between clusters,\n that builds the connected component\n$C$, that is, right after each merge at least\ntwo families in $C$ that were not connected become connected.\nMoreover, let $g_i$ be cluster produced by merging $m_i$.\nThe nodes of $T_C$ are the families in $C$ and the edges of $T_C$ are defined  as follows:\nfor each merge $m_i$ we create an edge $e_i$ between two arbitrarily chosen families, say $F^1$ and $F^2$, among those that were not connected before merge $m_i$ and also\nhave points in $g_i$, that is, \n$\\Pts(F^1) \\cap g_i \\ne \\emptyset$ and $\\Pts(F^2) \\cap g_i \\ne \\emptyset$.\nThe weight of $e_i$ is given by the diameter of $g_i$.\nFor the following results, let \\Diam$_i$ be the $i$th smallest diameter among the families\n that belong to $C$.\n\\remove{\nThe proof of  Proposition \\ref{prop:spanning-tree} can \n The key observation is that\nthe weight of $e_i$ is not larger than the diameter of families\nthat have at least two pure clusters right before  merge $m_i$\nand it is also not larger than the diameter of families in $C$ that have not\nbeen created when the merge $m_i$ occurs. By arguing that there\nat least $|C|-i+2$ families that satisfy one of these conditions, we establish the proof.\n}\n\\begin{proposition}\n\\label{prop:spanning-tree}\nThe weight of the cheapest edge of $T_C$ is at most \\Diam$_{1}$ and,\nfor $i>1$, the weight of its $i$th cheapest edge is at most \\Diam$_{i-1}$.\n\\end{proposition}\n\\begin{proof}\n\nLet $F$ be a family that has at least two pure clusters right before the merge $m_i$\nand let $h$ and $h'$ be two pure clusters w.r.t. $F$.\nWe first note that \n$$\\diamset(g_i) \\le \\max\\{dist(x,y)|(x,y) \\in h \\times h' \\} \\le \\diamset(h \\cup h') \\le \\diamset(F),$$\nwhere the first inequality holds due to\nthe choice of {\\tt Complete-Link} and Proposition \\ref{prop:monotonic}.\nMoreover, $$\\diamset(g_i) \\le \\diamset(F')$$ for any family in $C$\nthat does not exist before the merge. In fact,\nby condition (i) of  Lemma \\ref{lem:2pureclusters}\n$F'$ is created with at least two clusters, say $h$ and $h'$, and\n$\\diamset(g_i) \\le \\diamset(h \\cup h') \\le \\diamset(F')$, where  \nthe first inequality follows from Proposition \\ref{prop:monotonic}.\nHence, we can conclude that $\\diamset(g_1) \\le \\Diam_1$ because before\nthe first merging each family in $C$ that already exists\nis an isolated node in $G$ and has at least two pure clusters (condition (i) of  Lemma \\ref{lem:2pureclusters}).\nNow, we consider the case $i>1$. \n Let $a$ be the number of families in $C$ that have at least two pure clusters right before the merge $m_i$\nand let $b$ be the number of families in $C$ that have not been created yet. \nIt is enough to show that $a+b \\ge |C|-i+2$ (claim below).\nIn fact, in this case $|C|-i+2$ families in $C$ have\ndiameter not smaller than $\\diamset(g_i)$ so that $\\diamset(g_i) \\le \\Diam_{i-1}$ \n\n\\noindent{\\bf Claim.} $a+b \\ge |C|-i+2$\n\n\\noindent {\\it Proof}. Right before $m_i$, the families in $C$ are distributed in $(|C|-b)-i+1$ connected\n components in the graph $G$.\nIf one of these components has just one family, it follows from condition (i) of Lemma \\ref{lem:2pureclusters} that this family must have at least two pure clusters.\nIf one of these components has at least two families, then\nit follows from condition (ii) of Lemma \\ref{lem:2pureclusters}\nthat there are two families in this component, each of them with at least\ntwo pure clusters.\n\nSince $i>1$,  at least one component has at least two families. Thus, there\nare at least $(|C|-b)-i+2$ families with at least two pure clusters right before $m_i$.\nWe conclude that  $a \\ge (|C|-b)-i+2$ and, hence,  \n$a+b  \\ge |C|-i+2$\n\n\\noindent {\\it End of Proof}.\n\\end{proof}\n\nThe next proposition gives an upper bound\non the diameter of $F_C$ as a\nfunction of the diameters\nof the families in the component $C$ associated with $F_C$.\nIn high-level, its proof  considers\nthe path $P$ in $T_C$ between the families where the two farthest points in $\\Pts(F_C)$ lie\nand then use the triangle inequality  to show that\nthe distance between these points is upper bounded by the sum\nof the weights of the edges in $P$ plus the sum of the diameters\nof the nodes/families in $P$.

Note that $t <|C|$. \nRecall that in the construction of  $T_C$, an edge between families $u_i$ and $u_{u+1}$\nis associated with some cluster $g$. Let \n$p'_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ be, respectively, arbitrarily chosen \npoints in $\\Pts(u_i)$ and $\\Pts(u_{i+1})$ that belong to $g$.\n Now, consider the sequence of points\n$(a=p_1,p'_1,p_2,p'_2,\\ldots,p_t, p'_t=b)$.\nWe have that \n\\begin{align*}\n\\diamset(F_C)= dist(a,b) \\le \\\\ \n\\sum_{i=1}^t dist(p_i,p'_i)+ \\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} dist(p'_i,p_{i+1}) \\le \\\\\n \\sum_{i=2}^{|C|} \\Diam_i +  \\sum_{i=1}^{|C|-2} \\Diam_i, \n\\end{align*}\nwhere the first  inequality holds due to the triangle\ninequality and for the  second one we use the fact that\n$\\sum_{i=1}^t dist(p_i,p'_i)$ can be upper bounded\nby the $|C|-1$ largest diameters of the families in $C$ and\n Proposition \\ref{prop:spanning-tree} assures that \n $\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} dist(p'_i,p_{i+1})$\ncan be upper bounded by the sum of the weights\nof the $\n|C|-2$ most expensive edges of $T_C$.\n\\noindent {\\bf Case ii)}\nThe path from $F_a$ to $F_b$ in $T_C$\nhas  $|C|-1$ edges.\n\nSince $|C|>1$ we have that $F_a \\ne F_b$.\nIt follows from Proposition \\ref{prop:LS-addition} that  there is $y \\in \\{a,b\\}$ such that\na pure cluster w.r.t. family $F_y$  is added to $\\Ex$, before the creation of $F_C$,\nby either line  \\ref{line:addLr1}\nor line  \\ref{line:addLr2}.\nWe assume w.l.o.g. that $y=a$. Let\n$g$ be the pure cluster  w.r.t. $F_a$ that is added to $\\Ex$.\nWe assume that $F_C$ is created at iteration $t$\nand the addition of $g$ to $\\Ex$ happened at iteration $t'$, so that\n$t' \\le t$. \nWe cannot have $a \\in g$ because points that belong to clusters in $\\Ex$\nare not in $\\Pts(F_C)$. Moreover, $a$ cannot be in a pure cluster w.r.t. $F_a$ after\nthe $t'$-th merge,  otherwise we would  have $\\pure_{t'}(F_a)\\ge 2$ and\n$g$ would not have been added to $\\Ex$. Thus, right after the $t'$-th merge,     \n $a$  belongs to a cluster that contains a point, say $x$, from a\n family $F_x$ different from $F_a$.\n\n\\remove{\\noindent {\\it Claim.} There is $y \\in \\{a,b\\}$ that\nsatisfies the following: $y$ does not lie in a pure cluster when\n$F_C$ is created and at some iteration, a pure cluster from\n$F_y$  is added to $\\Ex$.\n\n\\noindent {\\it Proof of the Claim.}\nBy construction, when $|C|>1$, every family in $C$ but one has\na pure cluster  added to the set $\\Ex$ of singleton families (lines \\ref{line:addLr1}\nand \\ref{line:addLr2}).\nThen, either $a$ or $b$ belongs to a family  whose a pure cluster was added to\n$\\Ex$.

Despite their relevance, the current knowledge regarding the quality of the clustering produced by these methods is quite limited. This paper addresses the challenge of improving the understanding of the theoretical properties and approximation guarantees of linkage methods, particularly complete-link. Existing bounds on the maximum diameter of the clustering obtained by complete-link are not sufficient to separate it from single-link in terms of approximation with respect to the diameter. This limitation motivates the need for new and improved analysis to better understand the performance of complete-link and its suitability for producing compact clusters. The paper aims to provide a more refined analysis that can corroborate the common perception that complete-link is more suitable than single-link for producing compact clusters. By developing new bounds and techniques, the paper seeks to bridge the gap in the current understanding and offer a more accurate assessment of the quality of clustering produced by complete-link.\n\n## Main Idea\n\nThe paper presents new and improved bounds on the maximum diameter of the clustering obtained by complete-link for metric spaces. It introduces a new bound that allows for a separation between complete-link and single-link in terms of approximation with respect to the diameter, aligning with the common perception that complete-link is more suitable for producing compact clusters. The paper also shows that the techniques can be employed to derive upper bounds on the cohesion of a class of linkage methods that includes average-link and minimax. The main innovation lies in the refined analysis and the introduction of new techniques that provide a more accurate assessment of the quality of clustering produced by complete-link.\n\n## Interestingness\n\n8\n\n## Feasibility\n\n9\n\n## Novelty\n\n7\n\n```latex\n\\title{New bounds on the cohesion of complete-link and other linkage methods for agglomeration clustering}\n\n\\begin{abstract}\n\\remove{ Linkage methods such as \\complink \\,  are\namong the most popular algorithms for hierarchical clustering.\nDespite their relevance the current knowledge regarding the quality\nof the clustering produced by these methods is quite limited.\nHere, we improve the currently available\nbounds on the maximum diameter of the clustering obtained by\n\\complink \\, for metric spaces.\n\nOne of our new bounds, in contrast to the existing ones, allows us to \nseparate \\complink \\, from \\singlelink \\, in terms\nof approximation w.r.t. to the diameter,\naligning with the common perception \nthat the former is more suitable than the latter\nwhen the goal is producing compact clusters.\n}\n\n Linkage methods are\namong the most popular algorithms for hierarchical clustering.\nDespite their relevance the current knowledge regarding the quality\nof the clustering produced by these methods is limited.\nHere, we improve the currently available\nbounds on the maximum diameter of the clustering obtained by\n\\complink \\, for metric spaces.\n\nOne of our new bounds, in contrast to the existing ones, allows us to \nseparate \\complink \\, from \\singlelink \\, in terms\nof approximation for the diameter,\nwhich corroborates the common perception \nthat the former is more suitable than the latter\nwhen the goal is producing compact clusters.\n\nWe also show that our techniques \ncan be employed to derive upper bounds on the cohesion of a class of linkage methods that includes the quite popular \\avglink. \n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\n\n\\remove{\nMoreover, \nour new bounds allow us to \nseparate \\complink \\, from \\singlelink \\, in terms\nof approximation w.r.t. to the diameter,\naligning with the common perception \nthat the former is more suitable than the latter\nwhen the goal is producing compact clusters.\n}\n\\onecolumn\nClustering is the problem of partitioning a set of items so that similar items are grouped together and dissimilar items are separated. It is a fundamental tool in machine learning that is commonly used for exploratory analysis and for reducing the computational resources required to handle large datasets. For comprehensive descriptions of different clustering methods and their applications, we refer to \\citep{Jain:1999,HMMR15}. \n\nOne important type of clustering is hierarchical clustering.\nGiven a set  of $n$ points, a hierarchical clustering is a sequence of\nclusterings $({\\cal C}^0,{\\cal C}^{1},\\ldots,\\C^{n-1})$,\nwhere ${\\cal C}^0$ is a clustering with $n$ unitary clusters, \neach of them corresponding to one of the $n$ points,\nand  ${\\cal C}^{i}$, for $i \\ge 1$, is obtained from ${\\cal C}^{i-1}$ \n by replacing two clusters of ${\\cal C}^{i-1}$ with their union.\nHierarchical clustering algorithms are implemented in widely used machine learning libraries such as {\\tt scipy} and they have applications in many contexts such as in the study of evolution through phylogenetic trees \\citep{b684a7bdefca4810bdaaf10bf8196c46}. \n\nThere is a significant literature on hierarchical clustering; for  good surveys we refer to\n\\citep{10.1093/comjnl/26.4.354,DBLP:journals/widm/MurtaghC12}.\nWith regards to more theoretical work, one important line of research consists of designing algorithms for hierarchical clustering\n with provable guarantees for natural optimization criteria such as cluster diameter and the sum of quadratic errors \\citep{DASGUPTA2005555,DBLP:journals/siamcomp/CharikarCFM04,DBLP:journals/siamcomp/LinNRW10,DBLP:conf/esa/ArutyunovaR22}.\nAnother relevant line aims\nto understand the theoretical properties (e.g. approximation guarantees)\nof algorithms widely used in practice, such as linkage methods\n\\citep{DASGUPTA2005555,DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1012-3697,DBLP:conf/esa/GrosswendtR15,arutyunova_et_al:LIPIcs.APPROX/RANDOM.2021.18,DBLP:conf/soda/GrosswendtRS19}.\n\nHere, we contribute to this second line of research by\n giving new and improved analysis for the\n  \\complink  \\,\\citep{DBLP:journals/jmlr/AckermanB16}\n and also for a class of linkage methods\n that includes \n\\avglink\\, \\citep{DBLP:journals/jmlr/AckermanB16} and \\minimax \\, \\citep{BienTib2011}.\n \n\n\n \n \n\\subsection{Our Results}\nLet  $({\\cal X},dist)$ be a metric space, where ${\\cal X}$ is a set of $n$ points.\nThe diameter $\\diamset(S)$ of a set of points $S$ is  given by\n$\\diamset(S)=\\max\\{dist(x,y)|x,y \\in S\\}$.\nA \\emph{$k$-clustering} $\\C=\\{ C_i | 1 \\le i \\le k \\}$ is a partition of ${\\cal X}$ into $k$ groups. We define \n$$\\maxdiamset(\\C):=\\max\\{\\diamset(C_i)|1 \\le i \\le k\\} \\, \\, \\mbox{ and }\n\\,\\,  \\avgdiamset(\\C):=\\frac{1}{k} \\sum_{i=1}^k \\diamset(C_i).$$\nMoreover, let \\OPTDIMK and \\OPTAVGK be, respectively, the minimum possible  \\maxdiamset \\,  and \\avgdiamset \\, of a $k$-clustering\nfor $({\\cal X},dist)$. \n\n\n\\noindent {\\bf Arbitrary $k$.}\n First, in Section \\ref{sec:first-bound}, we\n prove that for all $k$ the maximum diameter of the $k$-clustering\nproduced by \\complink \\, is at most\n$k^{1.59} \\OPTAVGK $. \nSince\n$ \\OPTAVGK \\le \\OPTDIMK$,\nour result \n is an improvement\n over  $O(k^{1.59}\\OPTDIMK)$,  the best known  upper bound\non the maximum diameter of \\complink \\, \\citep{arutyunova2023upper}.\nIndeed, our bound can improve the previous one by up to a factor of $k$ \nsince there are instances in which  $\\OPTAVGK$ is $\\Theta( \\frac{\\OPTDIMK}{k})$.\n\nIt is noteworthy that by using $\\OPTAVG$ rather than $\\OPTDIM$,\nwe can corroborate with the intuition that \\complink \\, produces\nclusters with smaller diameters than those produced by \\singlelink \\,\nsince,\nin addition to the  $k^{1.59} \\OPTAVGK$ upper bound for the former,\nwe show an instance in which the maximum diameter of the latter is\n$\\Omega(k^2 \\OPTAVGK)$. \nWhen  $\\OPTDIM$ is employed, unexpectedly, as pointed out in \\citep{arutyunova2023upper}, this separation is not possible\nsince the maximum diameter of \\complink \\, is \n  $\\Omega(k \\OPTDIMK)$ while that of \\singlelink \\, is $\\Theta(k \\OPTDIMK)$. \n\nTo obtain the aforementioned upper bound, our main technique consists of carefully defining a partition \nof the clusters built by \\complink \\,  along its execution and then bounding\nthe diameter of the families in the partition. This technique\nyields an arguably simpler analysis than that of \\citep{arutyunova_et_al:LIPIcs.APPROX/RANDOM.2021.18,arutyunova2023upper}.\n\n\\remove{Moreover, it allows to show that $O(k^{1.59} \\OPTAVG )$   is also an upper bound\non the  average distance among the points  of every cluster in the \n$k$-clustering produced by \\avglink.\t\nFrom the best of our knowledge,\nour bound  is the first one with respect to a traditional\ncost function for this popular \nmethod.\n}\nNext, in Section \\ref{sec:better-bound}, by using our technique in a significantly more involved way, we show that the maximum diameter of the $k$-clustering\nproduced by \\complink \\, is at most \n$(2k-2) \\OPTDIMK$ for $k \\le 4$\nand at most $k^{1.30} \\OPTDIMK,$ for $k > 4$.\nThus, we considerably narrow the gap\nbetween the current upper bound and $\\Omega(k \\OPTDIMK ),$ the best known lower bound.\n\nFinally, in Section \\ref{sec:other-link}, we show that\nour  techniques can be employed  to obtain upper\nbounds on cohesion criteria \nof the clustering built by methods that  belong to a class of linkage methods that\nincludes \\avglink \\, and \\minimax.\nIn particular, we show that the average\npairwise distance of every cluster in  the $k$-clustering\nproduced  by \\avglink \\, is at most $k^{1,59} \\OPTAVGK$. \nTo the best of our knowledge,\nour analysis of the \\avglink \\, \nis the first one regarding to a cohesion criterion.\n\n\n\\noindent {\\bf Low values of $k$ and practical applications.}\nFor large $k$,  the upper bounds of \\complink, though close to the lower bound, are high and, thus, are not informative in the context of practical applications. However, as argued below, we have a different scenario for the very relevant case in which $k$ is small. The relevance of small $k$\n is that, in general, people have difficulties in analyzing a partition containing many groups (large $k$).\n\n\\citep{DBLP:journals/siamcomp/CharikarCFM04,DASGUPTA2005555} propose algorithms that obtain a hierarchical clustering  \nthat guarantees an 8-approximation to the diameter for every $k$.\nThe analysis  from\n\\citep{arutyunova2023upper} give, respectively, the following upper bounds on the approximation factor of \n \\singlelink \\, and \\complink \\,\nregarding the diameter: $4$ and $3$ for $k=2$; $6$ and $5.71$, for $k=3$\nand $8$ and $9$ for $k=4$.\nOur analysis gives \nan approximation factor \nof $2k-2$ for $k \\le 4$, \nwhich improves these bounds.\n For an assessment of the quality of these bounds, one should take into account that, unless $P=NP$, the problem of finding the $k$-clustering that minimizes the maximum diameter, for $k \\ge 3$, does not admit an approximation better than 2 in polytime \\citep{DBLP:journals/jsc/Megiddo90}.\n\n For $k \\ge 5$, the $k^{1.30} \\OPTDIMK$ upper bound does not improve the factor of 8. However, our $k^{1.59} \\OPTAVGK$ upper bound improves it for instances in which \n$\\OPTAVGK \\le \\frac{8}{k^{1.59}}  \\OPTDIMK$. Since $ \\frac{\\OPTDIMK}{k} \\le \\OPTAVGK \\le\n\\OPTDIMK$ , we can have improvements for $k \\le 34$.\n\nAn interesting aspect of our results\nis that they point in the opposite direction\nof the common intuition that\nbottom-up methods for hierarchical clustering do not work well\nfor small $k$ and, hence, are \nless preferable than bottom-up methods.\n\n\\remove{\nThere exists  an intuition that\ntop-down methods are preferable for small\n$k$, since it is not expected \nthat bottom-up methods work well in this setting. Our theoretical results\npoint in the opposite direction by \nproviding evidence that the performance\nof bottom-up methods is good for small $k$.\n}\n\\remove{We note that the quality of an approximation bound (e.g. factor 8 or 10) should be evaluated in light of the result from [Arutyunova and Röglin. 2022] which shows that no hierarchical compatible clustering can achieve an approximation smaller than 5.82 w.r.t the diameter (simultaneously for every $k$).\n}\n\n\n\\subsection{Related Work}\nLinkage methods are discussed  in a number of research papers and books on data mining\nand machine learning.\nHere, we discuss  works that provide provable guarantees for \nsome of the most popular linkage methods.\n\n\\noindent {\\bf Complete-link and Variants.} Several upper and lower bounds are known on the approximation factor for \\complink \\, with respect to the maximum diameter. \nWhen ${\\cal X}= \\mathbb{R}^d$, $d$ is constant and $dist$ is the Euclidean metric, \n\\citep{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1012-3697} proved that \\complink \\, is \nan $O(\\log k \\cdot \\OPTDIMK)$ approximation.\nThis was improved by \\citep{DBLP:conf/esa/GrosswendtR15} to $O(\\OPTDIMK)$.\nThe dependence on $d$ is doubly exponential.\n\nFor general metric spaces,\n\\citep{DASGUPTA2005555} showed that there are instances\nfor which the maximum diameter\nof the    $k$-clustering built by \\complink \\, is  $\\Omega(\\log k \\cdot \\OPTDIMK)$. \nIn  \\citep{arutyunova_et_al:LIPIcs.APPROX/RANDOM.2021.18} this lower bound\nwas improved to $\\Omega(k \\cdot \\OPTDIMK)$. Moreover, the same paper\nshowed that the maximum diameter of\n\\complink's  \\, $k$-clustering is  $O(k^{2} \\OPTDIMK)$.  This result was recently improved by the same authors to \n$O(k^{1.59} \\OPTDIMK)$ \\citep{arutyunova2023upper}.  \nWe note that the version of \\complink,  analyzed in \\citep{arutyunova_et_al:LIPIcs.APPROX/RANDOM.2021.18,arutyunova2023upper},\nmerges at each iteration the two clusters $A$ and $B$ for which\n$\\diamset(A \\cup B)$ is minimum.

Our proof maintains a dynamic partition of the clusters produced by \\complink\\, into families, where the diameter of each such family $F$ can be bounded in terms of the diameters of some of the $T_i$'s that it touches. We note that our bounds will depend on the choice of $\\T$ and we\ncan take the best possible $\\T$ according to our objective.\nIn this section, we take $\\T$ to be the $k$-clustering with minimum \\avgdiamset.\n\nIn Algorithm \\ref{alg:FamilyGeneration1}, we define how the families evolve along the execution of \\complink. \n  At the beginning, each of the $|{\\cal X}|$ points is a cluster. \nWe then define our first partition as $(F_1,\\ldots,F_k)$, where  $F_i$ is a family that contains $|T_i|$ clusters, each one being a point from\n$T_i$. Along the algorithm's execution, the families are organized in a directed forest $D$. Initially, the forest $D$ consists of $k$ isolated nodes,\nwhere the $i$th node corresponds to family $F_i$.\n\nWhen \\complink \\, merges the clusters  $g$ and $g'$ belonging\nto the families $F$ and $F'$, respectively, a new\nfamily $F^{new}$ is created and, in case (a) of Algorithm \\ref{alg:FamilyGeneration1}, a second new family $F^{new'}$ is also created. These new families contain all the clusters in $F$ and $F'$, except for\n$g$ and $g'$ that are replaced by the cluster $g \\cup g'$.\nMoreover, $F^{new}$ and $F^{new'}$ (when it is created)\nbecome parents of $F$ and $F'$ in $D$.

However, Algorithm \\ref{alg:FamilyGeneration1} and its analysis do not\n take full advantage of this idea. As an example, let us assume that \n at the beginning of some \niteration there are 3 regular families, say $F$, $F'$ and $F''$, \nwith $\\diamset(F) \\ge \\diamset(F') \\ge \\diamset(F'')$,\nall of them corresponding to roots of $D$. \nIf a cluster in $F$ is merged with one in $F'$ (case (b) of Algorithm \\ref{alg:FamilyGeneration1}) then \na new family is created and its diameter is used as a bound, which is \nnot desirable since it is larger than\nthat of $F''$.\n\nTo obtain a better bound, instead of creating a new family whenever\nclusters from different families, say $F$ and $F'$, are merged, we create an\nedge between $F$ and $F'$ in a dynamic graph $G$ that keeps track of the merges\namong different families. When a connected component of $G$ has\nat most one family that can still be used as a bounding tool, we\nreplace all families in the component with a new family.\nThe motivation for doing so  is to use a better bound\nas much as possible, which contrasts with the approach taken by \nAlgorithm \\ref{alg:FamilyGeneration1}.\n  \nThis new approach is presented in Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2}. \n The algorithm  maintains  a set of excluded clusters $\\Ex$;\n clusters in this set are \n never included in the families that the algorithm creates (line \\ref{line:FC-creation}).\nMoreover, it maintains\nboth a direct forest $D$ and\na graph $G$. \nEach  node of $G$ as well as each node of $D$ is associated with a family; an edge is created in $G$ between nodes/families $F$ and $F'$ if \\complink  \\, merges two clusters $g \\notin \\Ex$ and  $g' \\notin \\Ex$ \nthat, respectively, contain\npoints from  $\\Pts(F)$ and $\\Pts(F')$. \nThe graph and the forest may be updated at each iteration of Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2}.\n\nBefore giving extra details regarding Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2}, we need to explain the concept of\na pure cluster. A family $F$  is created (lines \\ref{line:initial-families} and  \\ref{line:FC-creation})\nby specifying the clusters that it contains.\n If a cluster $g$ is one of them,\n we say that $g$ is {\\em pure} w.r.t. $F$ or, alternatively,\n $F$ has the pure cluster $g$.\nMoreover, if a cluster $g$ is obtained by merging\ntwo clusters that are pure with respect to some family $F$\nthen $g$ is also pure w.r.t.  $F$. If a cluster is not\npure w.r.t. any family, we say that it is {\\em non-pure}.  \nWe use $\\pure_t(F)$ to denote the number of pure clusters w.r.t. $F$ that\nbelong to $\\C^t$.\nNote that if $pure_{t-1}(F) \\ge 2$\nthen  $\\diamset(F)$ is an upper bound on the diameter\nof the cluster that is created at iteration $t$, so that\nfamilies with at least two pure clusters play a role similar\nto that of regular families in the analysis of Algorithm \\ref{alg:FamilyGeneration1}.\n\nIn contrast to Algorithm \\ref{alg:FamilyGeneration1},\nwhere each cluster belongs to one family,\nin Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2} every cluster \nthat does not belong to $\\Ex$ is either pure w.r.t. some family $F$ in $G$ \n(this would be equivalent of belonging to $F$) or it is contained\nin $ \\bigcup_{H \\in C} \\Pts(H)$ for some connected component $C$ in $G$. \nFor our analysis, we note that $\\Pts(F)$, $\\diamset(F)$ and $|F|$ refer,\nrespectively, to the set of points of $F$, the diameter of $F$\nand the number of clusters in $F$ {\\bf at the moment} that $F$ is created. \n\nThe algorithm starts (lines \\ref{line:t0}-\\ref{line:end-init}) with the initialization\nof the set $\\Ex$, the forest $D$ and the graph $G$.\nThen, in the  loop, two clusters are merged\nfollowing the \\complink \\, rule.\n  In terms of the graph, each merge may lead to the\n  addition of new edges and also to the\nunion of two connected components.\nIn terms of the families,\na merge can reduce by one unit the number of\npure clusters of one or two families.\nIf this happens pure clusters \nmay be added to set $\\Ex$ (lines \\ref{line:addLr1} and \\ref{line:addLr2}) and this may also trigger one of the cases (a), (b) or (c).\nIf either (a) or (b) occurs a new family $F_C$, associated with the component $C$\nthat satisfies one of these cases, is created\nto replace all families in $C$ (line \\ref{line:FC-creation}).\nIf case (c) occurs the component $C$ is removed from $G$.\nThe main loop was carefully designed to guarantee that (i) at the beginning of each iteration there exists a family that has at least two pure clusters associated with it and (ii)  the diameter of  family $F_C$\n is slightly smaller than twice the sum of the diameters of the families in the \n underlying connected component $C$. \n\\begin{algorithm*}\n\\small\n\n  \\caption{{\\sc Tighter Bound for \\complink}  }\n   \\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\n\\STATE $\\C^{0} \\gets$ clustering with $n$ unitary clusters, each one containing a point of\n${\\cal X}$ \\label{line:t0} \\\\\n\n\\STATE $(T^*_1,\\ldots,T^*_k) \\gets$ a $k$-clustering with maximum diameter equal to \\OPTDIMK  \\\\\n\\STATE  For each $i$, with $|T^*_i| > 1$,  $F_i \\gets \\{ \\{x\\} | x \\in T^*_i\\}$  \\label{line:initial-families}\\\\\n\n\n\\STATE Create a forest $D$ with no edges and  vertex set  $\\{F_i|T^*_i \\mbox{ has  at least two points}\\}$  \\\\\n\n\\STATE Create a graph $G$ with no edges and  vertex set  $\\{F_i|T^*_i \\mbox{ has  at least two points}\\}$     \\label{line:end-init} \\\\\n\\STATE $\\Ex \\gets $ set of clusters $T^*_i$ with exactly one point  \\label{line:test} \\\\\n\n\\STATE  {\\bf For} $t:= 1 \\ldots n-k$  \\\\\n\\STATE\t\\hspace{0.5cm} $(g,g') \\gets$ next clusters to be merged by {\\tt Complete-Link} \\\\\n\n\\STATE\t\\hspace{0.5cm} $\\C^{t} \\gets \\C^{t-1} \\cup \\{g \\cup g'\\} -

We present an overview of the proof\n\nfull proof. \n\\begin{lemma} \n For $t \\le n-k$, at the beginning of iteration $t$ of Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2},\n each connected component $C$ of $G$ satisfies\none of the following properties:\n(i) $|C|=1$ and the only family of $C$ has at least\ntwo pure clusters  or (ii) $|C|>1$ and there exist  two  families in $C$\nsuch that\neach of them has at least two pure clusters.\n\\label{lem:2pureclusters}\n\\end{lemma}\n\\begin{proof}[Proof Sketch]\nWe first argue that if all components of $G$\nsatisfy the desired properties at the beginning of iteration $t$\nthen all components of $G$ also satisfy them at the beginning of  iteration $t+1$.\nNext, we argue that  $G$ does not have all its nodes removed\nat some iteration.\n\nAt the beginning of Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2}, all  the components in $G$ satisfy \nproperty (i) because, by line \\ref{line:end-init}, all the families $F_i$ in $G$ have  \nat least two clusters and all their clusters are pure. \n\nWhen two clusters are merged at some iteration $t$, then at most two\ndistinct families have their number of pure clusters\ndecreased by one unit (Proposition \\ref{prop:families-evol}).  As a result, one connected component, say $C$, \nwhere these families lie in the updated graph may not respect the conditions of the lemma anymore.\nHowever, in this case, we can show that either (a), (b) or (c) occurs. In the\ncase (c), the component  $C$ is removed from $G$, so we do not have a problem\nwith $C$ at the next iteration. If either (a) or (b) occurs,\n$C$ is replaced with a new component that only has the family $F_C$. \nProposition \\ref{prop:FC} shows \nthat there are two pure clusters w.r.t. $F_C$,  so this new component satisfies the condition (i). \n\nNow, assume that $G$ has all its nodes removed at\nsome iteration $t'$.\nIt is possible to conclude that at the beginning of $t'$,  $G$ has just one component, this component has just one family and this family has exactly 2 pure clusters. This together with the fact that at most $k$ clusters\nare added to $\\Ex$ (Proposition \\ref{prop:L-Bound}) allows the conclusion that there are at most $k+1$ clusters at the beginning of $t'$. But this is not a problem since $t' \\ge n-k$ in this case. \n\\end{proof}\n\nNow, we bound the diameter of the families $F_C$ at the moment they are created by Algorithm \\ref{alg:Families2}.\nTo this end, we define a spanning tree $T_C$ for\n $C$ and use its paths to bound the diameter of $F_C$.\n Consider the sequence\nof merges $m_1,\\ldots,m_{|C|-1}$, between clusters,\n that builds the connected component\n$C$, that is, right after each merge at least\ntwo families in $C$ that were not connected become connected.\nMoreover, let $g_i$ be cluster produced by merging $m_i$.\nThe nodes of $T_C$ are the families in $C$ and the edges of $T_C$ are defined  as follows:\nfor each merge $m_i$ we create an edge $e_i$ between two arbitrarily chosen families, say $F^1$ and $F^2$, among those that were not connected before merge $m_i$ and also\nhave points in $g_i$, that is, \n$\\Pts(F^1) \\cap g_i \\ne \\emptyset$ and $\\Pts(F^2) \\cap g_i \\ne \\emptyset$.\nThe weight of $e_i$ is given by the diameter of $g_i$.\nFor the following results, let \\Diam$_i$ be the $i$th smallest diameter among the families\n that belong to $C$.\n\\remove{\nThe proof of  Proposition \\ref{prop:spanning-tree} can \n The key observation is that\nthe weight of $e_i$ is not larger than the diameter of families\nthat have at least two pure clusters right before  merge $m_i$\nand it is also not larger than the diameter of families in $C$ that have not\nbeen created when the merge $m_i$ occurs. By arguing that there\nat least $|C|-i+2$ families that satisfy one of these conditions, we establish the proof.\n}\n\\begin{proposition}\n\\label{prop:spanning-tree}\nThe weight of the cheapest edge of $T_C$ is at most \\Diam$_{1}$ and,\nfor $i>1$, the weight of its $i$th cheapest edge is at most \\Diam$_{i-1}$.\n\\end{proposition}\n\\begin{proof}\n\nLet $F$ be a family that has at least two pure clusters right before the merge $m_i$\nand let $h$ and $h'$ be two pure clusters w.r.t. $F$.\nWe first note that \n$$\\diamset(g_i) \\le \\max\\{dist(x,y)|(x,y) \\in h \\times h' \\} \\le \\diamset(h \\cup h') \\le \\diamset(F),$$\nwhere the first inequality holds due to\nthe choice of {\\tt Complete-Link} and Proposition \\ref{prop:monotonic}.\nMoreover, $$\\diamset(g_i) \\le \\diamset(F')$$ for any family in $C$\nthat does not exist before the merge. In fact,\nby condition (i) of  Lemma \\ref{lem:2pureclusters}\n$F'$ is created with at least two clusters, say $h$ and $h'$, and\n$\\diamset(g_i) \\le \\diamset(h \\cup h') \\le \\diamset(F')$, where  \nthe first inequality follows from Proposition \\ref{prop:monotonic}.\nHence, we can conclude that $\\diamset(g_1) \\le \\Diam_1$ because before\nthe first merging each family in $C$ that already exists\nis an isolated node in $G$ and has at least two pure clusters (condition (i) of  Lemma \\ref{lem:2pureclusters}).\nNow, we consider the case $i>1$. \n Let $a$ be the number of families in $C$ that have at least two pure clusters right before the merge $m_i$\nand let $b$ be the number of families in $C$ that have not been created yet. \nIt is enough to show that $a+b \\ge |C|-i+2$ (claim below).\nIn fact, in this case $|C|-i+2$ families in $C$ have\ndiameter not smaller than $\\diamset(g_i)$ so that $\\diamset(g_i) \\le \\Diam_{i-1}$ \n\n\\noindent{\\bf Claim.} $a+b \\ge |C|-i+2$\n\n\\noindent {\\it Proof}. Right before $m_i$, the families in $C$ are distributed in $(|C|-b)-i+1$ connected\n components in the graph $G$.\nIf one of these components has just one family, it follows from condition (i) of Lemma \\ref{lem:2pureclusters} that this family must have at least two pure clusters.\nIf one of these components has at least two families, then\nit follows from condition (ii) of Lemma \\ref{lem:2pureclusters}\nthat there are two families in this component, each of them with at least\ntwo pure clusters.\n\nSince $i>1$,  at least one component has at least two families. Thus, there\nare at least $(|C|-b)-i+2$ families with at least two pure clusters right before $m_i$.\nWe conclude that  $a \\ge (|C|-b)-i+2$ and, hence,  \n$a+b  \\ge |C|-i+2$\n\n\\noindent {\\it End of Proof}.\n\\end{proof}\n\nThe next proposition gives an upper bound\non the diameter of $F_C$ as a\nfunction of the diameters\nof the families in the component $C$ associated with $F_C$.\nIn high-level, its proof  considers\nthe path $P$ in $T_C$ between the families where the two farthest points in $\\Pts(F_C)$ lie\nand then use the triangle inequality  to show that\nthe distance between these points is upper bounded by the sum\nof the weights of the edges in $P$ plus the sum of the diameters\nof the nodes/families in $P$.

Note that $t <|C|$. \nRecall that in the construction of  $T_C$, an edge between families $u_i$ and $u_{u+1}$\nis associated with some cluster $g$. Let \n$p'_i$ and $p_{i+1}$ be, respectively, arbitrarily chosen \npoints in $\\Pts(u_i)$ and $\\Pts(u_{i+1})$ that belong to $g$.\n Now, consider the sequence of points\n$(a=p_1,p'_1,p_2,p'_2,\\ldots,p_t, p'_t=b)$.\nWe have that \n\\begin{align*}\n\\diamset(F_C)= dist(a,b) \\le \\\\ \n\\sum_{i=1}^t dist(p_i,p'_i)+ \\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} dist(p'_i,p_{i+1}) \\le \\\\\n \\sum_{i=2}^{|C|} \\Diam_i +  \\sum_{i=1}^{|C|-2} \\Diam_i, \n\\end{align*}\nwhere the first  inequality holds due to the triangle\ninequality and for the  second one we use the fact that\n$\\sum_{i=1}^t dist(p_i,p'_i)$ can be upper bounded\nby the $|C|-1$ largest diameters of the families in $C$ and\n Proposition \\ref{prop:spanning-tree} assures that \n $\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} dist(p'_i,p_{i+1})$\ncan be upper bounded by the sum of the weights\nof the $\n|C|-2$ most expensive edges of $T_C$.\n\\noindent {\\bf Case ii)}\nThe path from $F_a$ to $F_b$ in $T_C$\nhas  $|C|-1$ edges.\n\nSince $|C|>1$ we have that $F_a \\ne F_b$.\nIt follows from Proposition \\ref{prop:LS-addition} that  there is $y \\in \\{a,b\\}$ such that\na pure cluster w.r.t. family $F_y$  is added to $\\Ex$, before the creation of $F_C$,\nby either line  \\ref{line:addLr1}\nor line  \\ref{line:addLr2}.\nWe assume w.l.o.g. that $y=a$.

At the heart of SparseTSF lies the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique, which simplifies the forecasting task by decoupling the periodicity and trend in time series data. This technique involves downsampling the original sequences to focus on cross-period trend prediction, effectively extracting periodic features while minimizing the model's complexity and parameter count. Based on this technique, the SparseTSF model uses fewer than \\textit{1k} parameters to achieve competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SparseTSF showcases remarkable generalization capabilities, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited computational resources, small samples, or low-quality data.\n",

                "abstract": "Time series are generated in diverse domains such as economic, traffic, health, and energy, where forecasting of future values has numerous important applications. Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains : traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The results offer a deeper understanding of the forecasting methods, allowing us to better select the ones that are most suitable for particular datasets and settings. Overall, TFB and this evaluation provide researchers with improved means of designing new TSF methods."

                "abstract": "Multivariate time series (MTS) prediction has been widely adopted in various scenarios. Recently, some methods have employed patching to enhance local semantics and improve model performance. However, length-fixed patch are prone to losing temporal boundary information, such as complete peaks and periods. Moreover, existing methods mainly focus on modeling long-term dependencies across patches, while paying little attention to other dimensions (e.g., short-term dependencies within patches and complex interactions among cross-variavle patches). To address these challenges, we propose a pure MLP-based HDMixer, aiming to acquire patches with richer semantic information and efficiently modeling hierarchical interactions. Specifically, we design a Length-Extendable Patcher (LEP) tailored to MTS, which enriches the boundary information of patches and alleviates semantic incoherence in series. Subsequently, we devise a Hierarchical Dependency Explorer (HDE) based on pure MLPs. This explorer effectively models short-term dependencies within patches, long-term dependencies across patches, and complex interactions among variables. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. The code is available at https://github.com/hqh0728/HDMixer."

Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios."

Deep train-from-scratch models have exhibited effective performance yet require large amounts of data, which limits real-world applicability. Recently, researchers have leveraged the representation learning transferability of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle limited non-linguistic datasets effectively. However, incorporating LLMs with time-series data presents challenges of limited adaptation due to different compositions between time-series and linguistic data, and the inability to process multi-scale temporal information. To tackle these challenges, we propose LLM4TS, a framework for time-series forecasting with pre-trained LLMs. LLM4TS consists of a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the \\textit{time-series alignment} stage to align LLMs with the nuances of time-series data, and the \\textit{forecasting fine-tuning} stage for downstream time-series forecasting tasks. Furthermore, our framework features a novel two-level aggregation method that integrates multi-scale temporal data within pre-trained LLMs, enhancing their ability to interpret time-specific information. In experiments across 7 time-series forecasting datasets, LLM4TS is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods compared with trained-from-scratch models in full-shot scenarios, and also achieves an average improvement of 6.84% in MSE in few-shot scenarios. In addition, evaluations compared with different self-supervised learning approaches highlight LLM4TS's effectiveness with representation learning in forecasting tasks."

We introduce the Placeholder-enhanced Technique (PET) to enhance the computational efficiency and predictive accuracy of Transformer in LTSF tasks. Furthermore, we delve into the impact of larger patch strategies and channel interaction strategies on Transformer's performance, specifically Long Sub-sequence Division (LSD) and Multi-channel Separation and Interaction (MSI). These strategies collectively constitute a novel model termed PETformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that PETformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used public datasets for LTSF, surpassing all existing models.

The multivariate forecasting models need to capture the relationship between the channels to accurately predict future values. However, recently, there has been an emergence of methods that employ the Channel Independent (CI) strategy. These methods view multivariate time series data as separate univariate time series and disregard the correlation between channels. Surprisingly, our empirical results have shown that models trained with the CI strategy outperform those trained with the Channel Dependent (CD) strategy, usually by a significant margin. Nevertheless, the reasons behind this phenomenon have not yet been thoroughly explored in the literature. This paper provides comprehensive empirical and theoretical analyses of the characteristics of multivariate time series datasets and the CI/CD strategy. Our results conclude that the CD approach has higher capacity but often lacks robustness to accurately predict distributionally drifted time series. In contrast, the CI approach trades capacity for robust prediction. Practical measures inspired by these analyses are proposed to address the capacity and robustness dilemma, including a modified CD method called Predict Residuals with Regularization (PRReg) that can surpass the CI strategy. We hope our findings can raise awareness among researchers about the characteristics of multivariate time series and inspire the construction of better forecasting models."

Patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and the model can attend longer history.

This paper focuses on temporal variation modeling, which is the common key problem of extensive analysis tasks. Previous methods attempt to accomplish this directly from the 1D time series, which is extremely challenging due to the intricate temporal patterns. Based on the observation of multi-periodicity in time series, we ravel out the complex temporal variations into the multiple intraperiod- and interperiod-variations. To tackle the limitations of 1D time series in representation capability, we extend the analysis of temporal variations into the 2D space by transforming the 1D time series into a set of 2D tensors based on multiple periods. This transformation can embed the intraperiod- and interperiod-variations into the columns and rows of the 2D tensors respectively, making the 2D-variations to be easily modeled by 2D kernels. Technically, we propose the TimesNet with TimesBlock as a task-general backbone for time series analysis. TimesBlock can discover the multi-periodicity adaptively and extract the complex temporal variations from transformed 2D tensors by a parameter-efficient inception block. Our proposed TimesNet achieves consistent state-of-the-art in five mainstream time series analysis tasks, including short- and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection.

In existing time series forecasting methods, the models take a sequence of numerical values as input and yield numerical values as output. The existing SOTA models are largely based on the Transformer architecture, modified with multiple encoding mechanisms to incorporate the context and semantics around the historical data. Inspired by the successes of pre-trained language foundation models, we pose a question about whether these models can also be adapted to solve time-series forecasting. Thus, we propose a new forecasting paradigm: prompt-based time series forecasting (PromptCast). In this novel task, the numerical input and output are transformed into prompts and the forecasting task is framed in a sentence-to-sentence manner, making it possible to directly apply language models for forecasting purposes. To support and facilitate the research of this task, we also present a large-scale dataset (PISA) that includes three real-world forecasting scenarios. We evaluate different SOTA numerical-based forecasting methods and language generation models. The benchmark results with various forecasting settings demonstrate the proposed PromptCast with language generation models is a promising research direction. Additionally, in comparison to conventional numerical-based forecasting, PromptCast shows a much better generalization ability under the zero-shot setting."

                "abstract": "Multivariate time series forecasting has seen widely ranging applications in various domains, including finance, traffic, energy, and healthcare. To capture the sophisticated temporal patterns, plenty of research studies designed complex neural network architectures based on many variants of RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. However, complex models are often computationally expensive and thus face a severe challenge in training and inference efficiency when applied to large-scale real-world datasets. In this paper, we introduce LightTS, a light deep learning architecture merely based on simple MLP-based structures. The key idea of LightTS is to apply an MLP-based structure on top of two delicate down-sampling strategies, including interval sampling and continuous sampling, inspired by a crucial fact that down-sampling time series often preserves the majority of its information. We conduct extensive experiments on eight widely used benchmark datasets. Compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, LightTS demonstrates better performance on five of them and comparable performance on the rest. Moreover, LightTS is highly efficient. It uses less than 5% FLOPS compared with previous SOTA methods on the largest benchmark dataset. In addition, LightTS is robust and has a much smaller variance in forecasting accuracy than previous SOTA methods in long sequence forecasting tasks."

Despite the growing performance over the past few years, we question the validity of this line of research in this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among the elements in a long sequence. However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in an ordered set of continuous points. While employing positional encoding and using tokens to embed sub-series in Transformers facilitate preserving some ordering information, the nature of the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss. \nTo validate our claim, we introduce a set of embarrassingly simple one-layer linear models named LTSF-Linear for comparison. Experimental results on nine real-life datasets show that LTSF-Linear surprisingly outperforms existing sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models in all cases, and often by a large margin. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to explore the impacts of various design elements of LTSF models on their temporal relation extraction capability. We hope this surprising finding opens up new research directions for the LTSF task. We also advocate revisiting the validity of Transformer-based solutions for other time series analysis tasks (e.g., anomaly detection) in the future."

Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3× or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data.

This paper studies the long-term forecasting problem of time series. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies. Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information utilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy, traffic, economics, weather and disease.

                "abstract": "—Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) represents a critical frontier in time series analysis, distinguished by its focus on extensive input sequences, in contrast to the constrained lengths typical of traditional approaches. While longer sequences inherently convey richer information, potentially enhancing predictive precision, prevailing techniques often respond by escalating model complexity. These intricate models can inflate into millions of parameters, incorporating parameter-intensive elements like positional encodings, feed-forward networks and self-attention mechanisms. This complexity, however, leads to prohibitive model scale, particularly given the time series data’s semantic simplicity. Motivated by the pursuit of parsimony, our research employs conditional correlation and auto-correlation as investigative tools, revealing significant redundancies within the input data. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the HDformer, a lightweight Transformer variant enhanced with hierarchical decomposition. This novel architecture not only inverts the prevailing trend toward model expansion but also accomplishes precise forecasting with drastically fewer computations and parameters. Remarkably, HDformer outperforms existing state-of-the-art LTSF models, while requiring over 99% fewer parameters. Through this work, we advocate a paradigm shift in LTSF, emphasizing the importance to tailor the model to the inherent dynamics of time series data—a timely reminder that in the realm of LTSF, bigger is not invariably better."

To address the above issues, we propose CrossGNN, a linear complexity GNN model to refine the cross-scale and cross-variable interaction for MTS. To deal with the unexpected noise in time dimension, an adaptive multi-scale identifier (AMSI) is leveraged to construct multi-scale time series with reduced noise. A Cross-Scale GNN is proposed to extract the scales with clearer trend and weaker noise. Cross-Variable GNN is proposed to utilize the homogeneity and heterogeneity between different variables. By simultaneously focusing on edges with higher saliency scores and constraining those edges with lower scores, the time and space complexity (i.e., O ( L ) ) of CrossGNN can be linear with the input sequence length L .

                "\n\n\\label{introduction}\n\nTime series forecasting holds significant value in domains such as traffic flow, product sales, and energy consumption, as accurate predictions enable decision-makers to plan proactively. Achieving precise forecasts typically relies on powerful yet complex deep learning models, such as RNNs~\\citep{RNN_NC}, TCNs~\\citep{TCN,TCN2}, and Transformers~\\citep{trans_time_survey}. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), which demands models to provide an extended predictive view for advanced planning \\citep{informer}.\n\nAlthough a longer predictive horizon offers convenience, it also introduces greater uncertainty \\citep{segrnn}. This demands models capable of extracting more extensive temporal dependencies from longer historical windows. Consequently, modeling becomes more complex to capture these long-term temporal dependencies. For instance, Transformer-based models often have millions or tens of millions of parameters, limiting their practical usability, especially in scenarios with restricted computational resources \\citep{HDformer}.\n\nIn fact, the basis for accurate long-term time series forecasting lies in the inherent periodicity and trend of the data. For example, long-term forecasts of household electricity consumption are feasible due to the clear daily and weekly patterns in such data. Particularly for daily patterns, if we \\textit{resample} the electricity consumption at a certain time of the day into a daily sequence, each subsequence exhibits similar or consistent trends. In this case, the original sequence's periodicity and trend are decomposed and transformed. That is, periodic patterns are transformed into \\textit{inter-subsequence} dynamics, while trend patterns are reinterpreted as \\textit{intra-subsequence} characteristics. This decomposition offers a novel perspective for designing lightweight LTSF models.\n\nIn this paper, we pioneer the exploration of how to utilize this inherent periodicity and decomposition in data to construct specialized lightweight time series forecasting models. Specifically, we introduce \\textbf{\\textit{SparseTSF}}, an extremely lightweight LTSF model. Technically, we propose the \\textit{Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting} technique (hereinafter referred to as Sparse technique). It first downsamples the original sequences with constant periodicity into subsequences, then performs predictions on each downsampled subsequence, simplifying the original time series forecasting task into a cross-period trend prediction task. This approach yields two benefits: (i) effective decoupling of data periodicity and trend, enabling the model to stably identify and extract periodic features while focusing on predicting trend changes, and (ii) extreme compression of the model's parameter size, significantly reducing the demand for computational resources. As shown in Figure~\\ref{fig1}, SparseTSF achieves near state-of-the-art prediction performance with less than \\textbf{\\textit{1k}} trainable parameters, which makes it \\textit{1\\(\\sim\\)4 orders of magnitude smaller} than its counterparts.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/fig1.pdf}\n    \\caption{Comparison of MSE and parameters between SparseTSF and other mainstream models on the Electricity dataset with a forecast horizon of 720.}\n    \\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn summary, our contributions in this paper are as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We propose a novel \\textit{Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting} technique, which downsamples the original sequences to focus on cross-period trend prediction, effectively extracting periodic features while minimizing the model’s complexity and parameter count.\n    \\item Based on the Sparse technique, we present the \\textit{SparseTSF} model, which requires fewer than \\textit{1k} parameters, significantly reducing the computational resource demand of forecasting models.\n    \\item The proposed SparseTSF model not only attains competitive or surpasses state-of-the-art predictive accuracy with a remarkably minimal parameter scale but also demonstrates robust generalization capabilities.\n\\end{itemize}\n"

Initially, the Transformer architecture \\citep{transformer}, known for its robust long-term dependency modeling capabilities, gained widespread attention in the LTSF domain. Models such as Informer~\\citep{informer}, Autoformer~\\citep{autoformer}, and FEDformer~\\citep{fedformer} have modified the native structure of Transformer to suit time series forecasting tasks. More recent advancements, like PatchTST~\\citep{patchtst} and PETformer~\\citep{petformer}, demonstrate that the original Transformer architecture can achieve impressive results with an appropriate patch strategy, a technique that is prevalently employed in the realm of computer vision \\citep{vit,MAE}. Besides Transformer architectures, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) are also mainstream approaches, including SCINet~\\citep{scinet}, TimesNet~\\citep{timesnet}, MICN~\\citep{micn}, TiDE~\\citep{tide}, and HDMixer~\\citep{HDMixer}. Recent studies have shown that transferring pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) to the time series domain can also yield commendable results \\citep{llm4ts, timellm, promptcast}. Moreover, recent works have revealed that RNN and GNN networks can also perform well in LTSF tasks, as exemplified by SegRNN~\\citep{segrnn} and CrossGNN~\\citep{crossgnn}.\n\n\\paragraph{Progress in Lightweight Forecasting Models}\nSince DLinear~\\citep{dlinear} demonstrated that simple models could already extract strong temporal periodic dependencies, numerous studies have been pushing LTSF models towards lightweight designs, including LightTS\\citep{lightts}, TiDE~\\citep{tide}, TSMixer~\\citep{TSMixer}, and HDformer~\\citep{HDformer}. Recently, FITS emerged as a milestone in the lightweight LTSF process, being the first to reduce the LTSF model scale to the \\textit{10k} parameter level while maintaining excellent predictive performance \\citep{fits}. FITS achieved this by transforming time-domain forecasting tasks into frequency-domain ones and using low-pass filters to reduce the required number of parameters. In this paper, our proposed SparseTSF model takes lightweight model design to the extreme. Utilizing the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique, it's the first to reduce model parameters to below \\textit{1k}.\n\n"

                "\\label{methodology}\n\\subsection{Preliminaries}\n\n\\paragraph{Long-term Time Series Forecasting}\nThe task of LTSF involves predicting future values over an extended horizon using previously observed multivariate time series (MTS) data. It is formalized as \\(\\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} = f(x_{t-L+1:t})\\), where \\(x_{t-L+1:t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times C}\\) and \\(\\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times C}\\). In this formulation, \\(L\\) represents the length of the historical observation window, \\(C\\) is the number of distinct features or channels, and \\(H\\) is the length of the forecast horizon. The main goal of LTSF is to extend the forecast horizon \\(H\\) as it provides richer and more advanced guidance in practical applications. However, an extended forecast horizon \\(H\\) also increases the complexity of the model, leading to a significant increase in parameters in mainstream models. To address this challenge, our research focuses on developing models that are not only extremely lightweight but also robust and effective.\n\n\\paragraph{Channel Independent Strategy}\nRecent advancements in the field of LTSF have seen a shift towards a Channel Independent (CI) approach, especially when dealing with multivariate time series data \\citep{CIorCD}. This strategy simplifies the forecasting process by focusing on individual univariate time series within the dataset. Instead of the traditional approach, which utilizes the entire multivariate historical data to predict future outcomes, the CI method finds a shared function \\(f: x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L} \\rightarrow \\bar{x}^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H}\\) for each univariate series. This approach provides a more targeted and simplified prediction model for each channel, reducing the complexity of accounting for inter-channel relationships.\n\nAs a result, the main goal of mainstream state-of-the-art models in recent years has shifted towards effectively predict by modeling long-term dependencies, including periodicity and trends, in univariate sequences. For instance, models like DLinear achieve this by extracting dominant periodicity from univariate sequences using a single linear layer \\citep{dlinear}. More advanced models, such as PatchTST~\\citep{patchtst} and TiDE~\\citep{tide}, employ more complex structures on single channels to extract temporal dependencies, aiming for superior predictive performance. In this paper, we adopt this CI strategy as well and focus on how to create an even more lightweight yet effective approach for capturing long-term dependencies in single-channel time series.\n\n\\subsection{SparseTSF}\n\nGiven that the data to be forecasted often exhibits constant, periodicity a priori (e.g., electricity consumption and traffic flow typically have fixed daily cycles), we propose the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique to enhance the extraction of long-term sequential dependencies while reducing the model's parameter scale. Utilizing a single linear layer to model the LTSF task within this framework leads to our SparseTSF model, as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig2}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!htb]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{figs/fig2.pdf}\n    \\caption{SparseTSF architecture.}\n    \\label{fig2}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\paragraph{Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting}\nAssuming that the time series \\(x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t}\\) has a known periodicity \\(w\\), the first step is to downsample the original series into \\(w\\) subsequences of length \\(n=\\left \\lfloor \\frac{L}{w}  \\right \\rfloor\\). A model with shared parameters is then applied to these subsequences for prediction. After prediction, the \\(w\\) subsequences, each of length \\(m=\\left \\lfloor \\frac{H}{w}  \\right \\rfloor\\), are upsampled back to a complete forecast sequence of length \\(H\\).\n\nIntuitively, this forecasting process appears as a sliding forecast with a sparse interval of \\(w\\), performed by a fully connected layer with parameter sharing within a constant period \\(w\\). This can be viewed as a model performing sparse sliding prediction across periods.\n\nTechnically, the downsampling process is equivalent to reshaping \\(x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t}\\) into a \\(n \\times w\\) matrix, which is then transposed to a \\(w \\times n\\) matrix. The sparse sliding prediction is equivalent to applying a linear layer of size \\(n \\times m\\) on the last dimension of the matrix, resulting in a \\(w \\times m\\) matrix. The upsampling step is equivalent to transposing the \\(w \\times m\\) matrix and reshaping it back into a complete forecast sequence of length \\(H\\).\n\nHowever, this approach currently still faces two issues: (i) loss of information, as only one data point per period is utilized for prediction, while the rest are ignored; and (ii) amplification of the impact of outliers, as the presence of extreme values in the downsampled subsequences can directly affect the prediction.\n\nTo address these issues, we \\textit{additionally} perform a sliding aggregation on the original sequence before executing sparse prediction, as depicted in Figure~\\ref{fig2}. Each aggregated data point incorporates information from other points within its surrounding period, addressing issue (i). Moreover, as the aggregated value is essentially a weighted average of surrounding points, it mitigates the impact of outliers, thus resolving issue (ii). Technically, this sliding aggregation can be implemented using a 1D convolution with zero-padding and a kernel size of \\( 2 \\times \\left \\lfloor \\frac{w}{2}  \\right \\rfloor\\ + 1\\). The process can be formulated as follows:\n\\begin{align}\nx^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t} = x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t} + \\text{Conv1D}(x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t})\n\\end{align}\n\\paragraph{Instance Normalization}\nTime series data often exhibit distributional shifts between training and testing datasets. Recent studies have shown that employing simple sample normalization strategies between the input and output of models can help mitigate this issue \\citep{revin, dlinear}. In our work, we also utilize a straightforward normalization strategy. Specifically, we subtract the mean of the sequence from itself before it enters the model and add it back after the model's output. This process is formulated as follows:\n\\begin{align}\nx^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t} = x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t} - \\mathbb{E}_t(x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t}),\\\\\n\\bar{x}^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H} = \\bar{x}^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H} + \\mathbb{E}_t(x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t}).\n\\end{align}\n\n\\paragraph{Loss Function}\nIn alignment with current mainstream practices in the field, we adopt the classic Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function for SparseTSF. This function measures the discrepancy between the predicted values \\(\\bar{x}^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H}\\) and the actual ground truth \\(y^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H}\\). It is formulated as:\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{C}\\sum_{i=1}^{C}\\left \\| y^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H}  \\right \\|_{2}^{2}.\n\\end{align}\n\\subsection{Theoretical Analysis}\n\\label{theoretical_analysis}\n\nIn this section, we provide a theoretical analysis of the SparseTSF model, focusing on its parameter efficiency and the effectiveness of the Sparse technique.\n\n\\subsubsection{Parameter Efficiency of SparseTSF}\n\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{theorem1}\nGiven a historical look-back window length \\(L\\), a forecast horizon \\(H\\), and a constant periodicity \\(w\\), the total number of parameters required for the SparseTSF model is \\( \\left \\lfloor \\frac{L}{w} \\right \\rfloor \\times \\left \\lfloor \\frac{H}{w} \\right \\rfloor + 2 \\times \\left \\lfloor \\frac{w}{2}  \\right \\rfloor\\ + 1 \\).\n\\end{theorem}\n\nIn LTSF tasks, the look-back window length \\(L\\) and forecast horizon \\(H\\) are usually quite large, for instance, up to 720, while the intrinsic periodicity \\(w\\) of the data is also typically large, such as 24. In this scenario, \\( \\left \\lfloor \\frac{L}{w} \\right \\rfloor \\times \\left \\lfloor \\frac{H}{w} \\right \\rfloor + 2 \\times \\left \\lfloor \\frac{w}{2} \\right \\rfloor + 1 \\ll L \\times H \\). This means that the parameter scale of the SparseTSF model is much lighter than even the simplest single-layer linear model. This demonstrates the lightweight architecture of the SparseTSF model.\n\n\\subsubsection{Effectiveness of SparseTSF}\nThe time series targeted for long-term forecasting often exhibits constant periodicity. Here, we first define the representation of such a sequence \\( X \\).\n\n\\begin{definition}\n\\label{definition}\nConsider a \\textit{univariate} time series \\( X \\) with a known period \\( w \\), which can be decomposed into a periodic component \\( P(t) \\) and a trend component \\( T(t) \\), such that \\( X(t) = P(t) + T(t) \\). Here, \\( P(t) \\) represents the periodic part and satisfies the condition:\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{periodic_func}\nP(t) = P(t + w).\n\\end{align}\n\\end{definition}\n\nFurthermore, we can derive the form of the modeling task after downsampling.\n\nIn the context of a truncated subsequence \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\) of \\( X(t) \\) and its corresponding future sequence \\( x_{t+1:t+H} \\) to be forecasted, the conventional approach involves using \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\) directly to predict \\( x_{t+1:t+H} \\), essentially estimating the function:\n\\begin{align}\nx_{t+1:t+H} = f(x_{t-L+1:t})\n\\end{align}\nHowever, with the application of the Sparse technique, this forecasting task transforms into predicting downsampled subsequences, as per Lemma~\\ref{lemma}.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{lemma}\nThe SparseTSF model reformulates the forecasting task into predicting downsampled subsequences, namely:\n\\begin{align}\nx'_{t+1:t+m} = f(x'_{t-n+1:t})\n\\end{align}\n\\end{lemma}\n\nCombining Definition~\\ref{definition} and Lemma~\\ref{lemma}, we can further deduce Theorem~\\ref{theorem2}.\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{theorem2}\nGiven a time series dataset that satisfies Definition~\\ref{definition}, the SparseTSF model's formulation becomes:\n\\begin{align}\np'_{t+1:t+m}+t'_{t+1:t+m} = f(p'_{t-n+1:t}+t'_{t-n+1:t})\n\\end{align}\nwhere, for any \\(i \\in [t-n+1:t+m]\\) and \\(j \\in [t-n+1:t+m]\\), satisfying:\n\\begin{align}\np'_i = p'_j\n\\end{align}\n\\end{theorem}\n\nTheorem~\\ref{theorem2} implies that the task of the SparseTSF model effectively transforms into predicting future \\textit{trend} components (i.e., \\(t'\\)), using the \\textit{constant} periodic components (i.e., \\(p'\\)) as a reference. This process effectively separates the periodic components, which are no longer explicitly modeled, allowing the model to focus more on the trend variations.\n\nIntuitively, We can further validate this finding from the perspective of \\textit{autocorrelation}, a powerful tool for identifying patterns such as seasonality or periodicity in time series data.\n\n\\begin{definition}[AutoCorrelation Function (ACF) \\citep{acf}]\n\\label{definition2}\nGiven a time series \\( \\{X_t\\} \\), where \\( t \\) represents discrete time points, the ACF at lag \\( k \\) is defined as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{ACF}(k) = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{N-k} (X_t - \\mu)(X_{t+k} - \\mu)}{\\sum_{t=1}^{N} (X_t - \\mu)^2}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere \\( N \\) is the total number of observations in the time series, \\( X_t \\) is the value of the series at time \\( t \\), \\( X_{t+k} \\) is the value of the series at time \\( t+k \\), and \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the series \\( \\{X_t\\} \\). \n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]  \n    \\centering\n    \\subcaptionbox{Original}{\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\linewidth]{figs/etth1a.pdf}} \\label{fig3a}\n    \\subcaptionbox{Downsampled}{\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\linewidth]{figs/etth1b.pdf}}\n    \\label{fig3b}\n    \\caption{Comparison of autocorrelation in original and downsampled subsequences for the first channel in the ETTh1 dataset.}\n    \\label{fig3}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe lag time \\( k \\) in the ACF reveals the periodic patterns in the series, that is, when \\( k \\) equals the periodic length of the series, the ACF value typically shows a significant peak. As shown in Figure~\\ref{fig3}, the original sequence exhibits clear periodicity, while the downsampled subsequences retain only trend characteristics. This demonstrates that, through its downsampling strategy, the SparseTSF model can efficiently separate and extract accurate periodic features from time series data. This not only reduces the complexity of the model but also enables it to focus on predicting trend variations, thereby exhibiting impressive performance in LTSF tasks.\nIn summary, the SparseTSF model's design, characterized by its parameter efficiency and focus on decoupling periodic features, makes it well-suited for LTSF tasks, especially in scenarios where the data exhibits clear periodic patterns. \n\n"

Furthermore, in terms of runtime metrics, Max Memory and Epoch Time, SparseTSF significantly outperforms other mainstream models, rivaling the existing lightweight models (i.e., DLinear and FITS). Herein, DLinear benefits from a shorter look-back length, achieving the lowest overhead, while FITS and SparseTSF incur additional overhead due to extra operations (i.e., Fourier transformation and resampling).\n\n\\begin{table}[!htb]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison of the scale of parameters on Electricity dataset between SparseTSF and FITS models under different configurations of look-back length and forecast horizon, where SparseTSF operates with \\(w=24\\) and FITS employs COF at the \\(2^{th}\\) harmonic.}\n\\label{parameters}\n\\begin{adjustbox}{max width=\\linewidth}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc|cccc}\n\\toprule\nModel & \\multicolumn{4}{c|}{SparseTSF (Ours)} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{FITS~\\citeyearpar{fits}} \\\\ \\midrule\n\\diagbox{Horizon}{Look-back} & 96 & 192 & 336 & 720 & 96 & 192 & 336 & 720 \\\\ \\midrule\n\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{96} & 41 & 57 & 81 & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{145} & 840 & 1,218 & 2,091 & 5,913 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{192} & 57 & 89 & 137 & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{265} & 1,260 & 1,624 & 2,542 & 6,643 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{336} & 81 & 137 & 221 & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{445} & 1,890 & 2,233 & 3,280 & 7,665 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{720} & 145 & 265 & 445 & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{925} & 3,570 & 3,857 & 5,125 & 10,512 \\\\ \\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{adjustbox}\n\\end{table}\n\nAdditionally, we conducted a comprehensive comparison with FITS, a recent milestone work in the field of LTSF model lightweight progression.

Therefore, SparseTSF marks another significant advancement in the journey towards lightweight LTSF models.\n\\subsection{Ablation Studies and Analysis}\nBeyond its ultra-lightweight characteristics, the Sparse technique also possesses a robust capability to extract periodic features, which we will delve further into in this section.\n\n\\begin{table}[!htb]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation MSE results of the Sparse technique.

Additionally, the Sparse technique can be integrated with other foundational models, including the Transformer~\\citep{transformer} and GRU~\\citep{gru} models. As demonstrated in the results of Table~\\ref{ablation}, the incorporation of the Sparse technique significantly enhances the performance of all models, including Linear, Transformer, and GRU. Specifically, the Linear model showed an average improvement of 4.7\\%, the Transformer by 21.4\\%, and the GRU by 12.4\\%. These results emphatically illustrate the efficacy of the Sparse technique. Therefore, the Sparse technique can substantially improve the performance of base models in LTSF tasks.\n\\paragraph{Representation Learning of the Sparse Technique}\nIn Section~\\ref{theoretical_analysis}, we theoretically analyzed the reasons why the Sparse technique can enhance the performance of forecasting tasks. Here, we further reveal the role of the Sparse technique from a representation learning perspective. Figure~\\ref{fig3} shows the distribution of normalized weights for both the trained Linear model and the SparseTSF model. The weight of the Linear model is an \\(L \\times H\\) matrix, which can be directly obtained. However, as the SparseTSF model is a sparse model, we need to acquire its equivalent weights. To do this, we first input \\(H\\) one-hot encoded vectors of length \\(L\\) into the SparseTSF model (when \\(L\\) equals \\(H\\), this can be simplified to a diagonal matrix, i.e., diagonal elements are 1, and other elements are 0). We then obtain and transpose the corresponding output to get the equivalent \\(L \\times H\\) weight matrix of SparseTSF. When \\(L\\) equals \\(H\\), this process is formulated as:\n\\begin{align}\n     {weight}'=\\textit{SparseTSF}(\\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 0 & \\dots  & 0\\\\\n     0 & 1 & \\dots & 0\\\\\n     \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & 0\\\\\n     0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}) ^\\top.\n\\end{align}\n\\begin{figure*}[!htb]  \n    \\centering\n    \\subcaptionbox{Linear}{\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\linewidth]{figs/weight_etth1_l.pdf}} \\label{fig4a}\n    \\subcaptionbox{SparseTSF}{\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\linewidth]{figs/weight_etth1_s.pdf}}\n    \\label{fig4b}\n    \\caption{Visualization of normalized weights of the model trained on the ETTh1 dataset with both look-back length (X-axis) and forecast horizon (Y-axis) of 96.}\n    \\label{fig4}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFrom the visualization in Figure~\\ref{fig4}, two observations can be made: (i) The Linear model can learn evenly spaced weight distribution stripes (i.e., periodic features) from the data, indicating that single linear layer can already extract the primary periodic characteristics from a univariate series with the CI strategy. These findings are consistent with previous research conclusions \\citep{dlinear}. (ii) Compared to the Linear model, SparseTSF learns more distinct evenly spaced weight distribution stripes, indicating that SparseTSF has a stronger capability in extracting periodic features. This phenomenon aligns with the conclusions of Section~\\ref{theoretical_analysis}.\n\nTherefore, the Sparse technique can enhance the model's performance in LTSF tasks by strengthening its ability to extract periodic features from data.\n\\paragraph{Impact of the Hyperparameter \\(w\\)}\n\nThe Sparse technique relies on the manual setting of the hyperparameter \\(w\\), which represents the a priori main period. Here, we delve into the influence of different values of \\(w\\) on the forecast outcomes. As indicated in the results from Table~\\ref{period}, SparseTSF exhibits optimal performance when \\(w=24\\), aligning with the intrinsic main period of the data. Conversely, when \\(w\\) diverges from 24, a slight decline in performance is observed. This suggests that the hyperparameter \\(w\\) should ideally be set consistent with the data's a priori main period.\n\n\\begin{table}[!htb]\n\\centering\n\\caption{MSE results of SparseTSF on ETTh1 with varied hyperparameters \\(w\\).}\n\\label{period}\n\\begin{adjustbox}{max width=\\linewidth}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc|ccc}\n\\toprule\nHorizon & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}SparseTSF\\\\ (\\(w\\)=6)\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}SparseTSF\\\\ (\\(w\\)=12)\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}SparseTSF\\\\ (\\(w\\)=24)\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}SparseTSF\\\\ (\\(w\\)=48)\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}FITS\\\\ \\citeyearpar{fits} \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}DLinear\\\\ \\citeyearpar{dlinear} \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}PatchTST\\\\ \\citeyearpar{patchtst} \\end{tabular} \\\\ \\midrule\n96 & 0.376 & 0.369 & \\textbf{0.359} & 0.380 & 0.375 & 0.374 & 0.370 \\\\\n192 & 0.410 & 0.402 & \\textbf{0.397} & 0.400 & 0.408 & 0.405 & 0.413 \\\\\n336 & 0.408 & 0.406 & 0.404 & \\textbf{0.399} & 0.429 & 0.429 & 0.422 \\\\\n720 & 0.427 & 0.423 & \\textbf{0.417} & 0.427 & 0.427 & 0.440 & 0.447 \\\\\\midrule\nAvg. & 0.405 & 0.400 & \\textbf{0.394} & 0.402 & 0.410 & 0.412 & 0.413 \\\\ \\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{adjustbox}\n\\end{table}\n\nIn practical scenarios, datasets requiring long-term forecasting often exhibit inherent periodicity, such as daily or weekly cycles, common in domains like electricity, transportation, energy, and consumer goods consumption.  Therefore, empirically identifying the predominant period and setting the appropriate \\(w\\) for such data is both feasible and straightforward. However, for data lacking clear periodicity and patterns, such as financial data, current LTSF models may not be effective \\citep{dlinear}. Thus, the SparseTSF model may not be the preferred choice for these types of data. Nonetheless, we will further discuss the existing limitations and potential improvements of the SparseTSF model in the Section~\\ref{limits}.\n\n\\paragraph{Generalization Ability of the SparseTSF Model}\nThe Sparse technique enhances the model's ability to extract periodic features from data. Therefore, the generalization capability of a trained SparseTSF model on different datasets with the \\textit{same principal periodicity} is promising. To investigate this, we further studied the cross-domain generalization performance of the SparseTSF model (i.e., training on a dataset from one domain and testing on a dataset from another). Specifically, we examined the performance from ETTh2 to ETTh1, which are datasets of the same type but collected from different machines, each with 7 variables. Additionally, we explored the performance from Electricity to ETTh1, where these datasets originate from different domains and have a differing number of variables (i.e., Electricity has 321 variables). On datasets with different numbers of variables, models trained with traditional non-CI strategies (like Informer) cannot transfer, whereas those trained with CI strategies (like PatchTST) can, due to the decoupling of CI strategies from channel relationships. These datasets all have a daily periodicity, i.e., a prior predominant period of \\(w=24\\).\n\n\\begin{table}[!htb]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison of generalization capabilities between SparseTSF and other mainstream models.

It is expected that performance on ETTh2 to ETTh1 would be superior to Electricity to ETTh1. Furthermore, in both scenarios, the generalization performance of SparseTSF is nearly on par with the performance of direct modeling in the SparseTSF source domain as shown in Table~\\ref{main_reslut} and surpasses other baselines that model directly in the source domain. This robustly demonstrates the generalization capability of SparseTSF, indirectly proving the Sparse technique's ability to extract stable periodic features.\n\nTherefore, the SparseTSF model exhibits outstanding generalization capabilities. This characteristic is highly beneficial for the application of the SparseTSF model in scenarios involving small samples and low-quality data.\n"

                "\n\\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}\n\\label{limits}\n\nThe SparseTSF model proposed in this paper excels in handling data with a stable main period, demonstrating enhanced feature extraction capabilities and an extremely lightweight architecture. However, there are two scenarios where SparseTSF may not be as effective:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Ultra-Long Periods}: In cases involving ultra-long periods (for example, periods exceeding 100), the Sparse technique results in overly sparse parameter connections. Consequently, SparseTSF does not perform optimally in such scenarios.\n\\item \\textbf{Multiple Periods}: SparseTSF may struggle with data that intertwines multiple periods, as the Sparse technique can only downsample and decompose one main period.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nFinally, one of our key future research directions is to further address the these potential limitations by designing additional modules to enhance SparseTSF's ability, thus achieving a balance between performance and parameter size.\n\\subsection{Differences Compared to Existing Methods}\nThe Sparse technique proposed in this paper involves downsampling/upsampling to achieve periodicity/trend decoupling. It may share a similar idea with existing methods, as downsampling/upsampling and periodic/trend decomposition techniques are prevalent in related literature nowadays.\n\n\\paragraph{SparseTSF Compared to N-HiTS}\nN-HiTS incorporates novel hierarchical interpolation and multi-rate data sampling techniques to achieve better results \\citep{Nhits}. The downsampling and upsampling techniques proposed in SparseTSF are indeed quite different from those used in N-HiTS, including:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The downsampling and upsampling in SparseTSF occur before and after the model's prediction process, respectively, whereas N-HiTS conducts these operations within internally stacked modules.\n    \\item SparseTSF's downsampling involves resampling by a factor of \\(w\\) to \\(w\\) subsequences of length \\(L/w\\), which is technically equivalent to matrix reshaping and transposition, whereas N-HiTS employs downsampling through max-pooling.\n    \\item SparseTSF's upsampling involves transposing and reshaping the predicted subsequences back to the original sequence, whereas N-HiTS achieves upsampling through interpolation.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\paragraph{SparseTSF Compared to OneShotSTL}\nSeasonal-trend decomposition (STD) is a classical and powerful tool for time series forecasting, and OneShotSTL makes a great contribution to advancing the lightweight long-term forecasting process, featuring fast, lightweight, and powerful capabilities \\citep{OneShotSTL}. However, SparseTSF differs significantly from OneShotSTL in several aspects:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item SparseTSF is a neural network model while OneShotSTL is a non-neural network method focused on online forecasting.\n    \\item OneShotSTL minimizes residuals and calculates trend and seasonal subseries separately from the original sequence with lengths of \\(L\\), whereas our SparseTSF resamples the original sequence into \\(w\\) subseries of length \\(L/w\\) with a constant period \\(w\\).\n    \\item OneShotSTL accelerates inference by optimizing the original computation for online processing, while SparseTSF achieves lightweighting by using parameter-sharing linear layers for prediction across all subseries.\n\\end{itemize}\n \n"

However, achieving precise forecasts over extended horizons is challenging due to the complexity of capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Existing models like RNNs, TCNs, and Transformers, while powerful, are computationally intensive and often have millions of parameters, limiting their practical usability in resource-constrained environments. These models struggle to effectively extract periodicity and trend from time series data, which are essential for accurate long-term forecasting. The basis for accurate LTSF lies in the inherent periodicity and trend of the data, such as daily and weekly patterns in household electricity consumption. This periodicity and trend can be decomposed and transformed into inter-subsequence dynamics and intra-subsequence characteristics, respectively. However, current models do not efficiently utilize this decomposition, leading to inefficiencies in parameter usage and computational resources.

This paper studies the long-term forecasting problem of time series. Prior Transformer-based models adopt various self-attention mechanisms to discover the long-range dependencies. However, intricate temporal patterns of the long-term future prohibit the model from finding reliable dependencies. Also, Transformers have to adopt the sparse versions of point-wise self-attentions for long series efficiency, resulting in the information utilization bottleneck. Going beyond Transformers, we design Autoformer as a novel decomposition architecture with an Auto-Correlation mechanism. We break with the pre-processing convention of series decomposition and renovate it as a basic inner block of deep models. This design empowers Autoformer with progressive decomposition capacities for complex time series. Further, inspired by the stochastic process theory, we design the Auto-Correlation mechanism based on the series periodicity, which conducts the dependencies discovery and representation aggregation at the sub-series level. Auto-Correlation outperforms self-attention in both efficiency and accuracy. In long-term forecasting, Autoformer yields state-of-the-art accuracy, with a 38% relative improvement on six benchmarks, covering five practical applications: energy, traffic, economics, weather and disease.

To address these problems, we propose to combine Transformer with the seasonal-trend decomposition method, in which the decomposition method captures the global profile of time series while Transformers capture more detailed structures. To further enhance the performance of Transformer for long-term prediction, we exploit the fact that most time series tend to have a sparse representation in well-known basis such as Fourier transform, and develop a frequency enhanced Transformer. Besides being more effective, the proposed method, termed as Frequency Enhanced Decomposed Transformer ({\\bf FEDformer}), is more efficient than standard Transformer with a linear complexity to the sequence length. Our empirical studies with six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, FEDformer can reduce prediction error by $14.8\\%$ and $22.6\\%$ for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

This paper focuses on temporal variation modeling, which is the common key problem of extensive analysis tasks. Previous methods attempt to accomplish this directly from the 1D time series, which is extremely challenging due to the intricate temporal patterns. Based on the observation of multi-periodicity in time series, we ravel out the complex temporal variations into the multiple intraperiod- and interperiod-variations. To tackle the limitations of 1D time series in representation capability, we extend the analysis of temporal variations into the 2D space by transforming the 1D time series into a set of 2D tensors based on multiple periods. This transformation can embed the intraperiod- and interperiod-variations into the columns and rows of the 2D tensors respectively, making the 2D-variations to be easily modeled by 2D kernels. Technically, we propose the TimesNet with TimesBlock as a task-general backbone for time series analysis. TimesBlock can discover the multi-periodicity adaptively and extract the complex temporal variations from transformed 2D tensors by a parameter-efficient inception block. Our proposed TimesNet achieves consistent state-of-the-art in five mainstream time series analysis tasks, including short- and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and anomaly detection.

We found, however, that there is still great room for improvement in how to preserve historical information in neural networks while avoiding overfitting to noise presented in the history. Addressing this allows better utilization of the capabilities of deep learning models. To this end, we design a \\textbf{F}requency \\textbf{i}mproved \\textbf{L}egendre \\textbf{M}emory model, or {\\bf FiLM}: it applies Legendre Polynomials projections to approximate historical information, uses Fourier projection to remove noise, and adds a low-rank approximation to speed up computation. Our empirical studies show that the proposed FiLM significantly improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art models in multivariate and univariate long-term forecasting by (\\textbf{20.3\\%}, \\textbf{22.6\\%}), respectively.

It is based on two key components: (i) segmentation of time series into subseries-level patches which are served as input tokens to Transformer; (ii) channel-independence where each channel contains a single univariate time series that shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series. Patching design naturally has three-fold benefit: local semantic information is retained in the embedding; computation and memory usage of the attention maps are quadratically reduced given the same look-back window; and the model can attend longer history. Our channel-independent patch time series Transformer (PatchTST) can improve the long-term forecasting accuracy significantly when compared with that of SOTA Transformer-based models. We also apply our model to self-supervised pre-training tasks and attain excellent fine-tuning performance, which outperforms supervised training on large datasets. Transferring of masked pre-trained representation on one dataset to others also produces SOTA forecasting accuracy.

Despite the growing performance over the past few years, we question the validity of this line of research in this work. Specifically, Transformers is arguably the most successful solution to extract the semantic correlations among the elements in a long sequence. However, in time series modeling, we are to extract the temporal relations in an ordered set of continuous points. While employing positional encoding and using tokens to embed sub-series in Transformers facilitate preserving some ordering information, the nature of the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism inevitably results in temporal information loss. \nTo validate our claim, we introduce a set of embarrassingly simple one-layer linear models named LTSF-Linear for comparison. Experimental results on nine real-life datasets show that LTSF-Linear surprisingly outperforms existing sophisticated Transformer-based LTSF models in all cases, and often by a large margin. Moreover, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to explore the impacts of various design elements of LTSF models on their temporal relation extraction capability. We hope this surprising finding opens up new research directions for the LTSF task. We also advocate revisiting the validity of Transformer-based solutions for other time series analysis tasks (e.g., anomaly detection) in the future.\n@inproceedings{dlinear,\n  title={Are transformers effective for time series forecasting?},\n  author={Zeng, Ailing and Chen, Muxi and Zhang, Lei and Xu, Qiang},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence},\n  volume={37},\n  number={9},\n  pages={11121--11128},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{fits,\n  title={FITS: Modeling Time Series with $10 k $ Parameters},\n  author={Xu, Zhijian and Zeng, Ailing and Xu, Qiang},\n  booktitle={The Twelfth International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2024}\n}\n\n% related work\nAbstract: The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.\n@article{transformer,\n  title={Attention is all you need},\n  author={Vaswani, Ashish and Shazeer, Noam and Parmar, Niki and Uszkoreit, Jakob and Jones, Llion and Gomez, Aidan N and Kaiser, {\\L}ukasz and Polosukhin, Illia},\n  journal={Advances in neural information processing systems},\n  volume={30},\n  year={2017}\n}\n\nAbstract: Recently, the superiority of Transformer for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks has been challenged, particularly since recent work has shown that simple models can outperform numerous Transformer-based approaches. This suggests that a notable gap remains in fully leveraging the potential of Transformer in LTSF tasks. Consequently, this study investigates key issues when applying Transformer to LTSF, encompassing aspects of temporal continuity, information density, and multi-channel relationships. We introduce the Placeholder-enhanced Technique (PET) to enhance the computational efficiency and predictive accuracy of Transformer in LTSF tasks. Furthermore, we delve into the impact of larger patch strategies and channel interaction strategies on Transformer's performance, specifically Long Sub-sequence Division (LSD) and Multi-channel Separation and Interaction (MSI). These strategies collectively constitute a novel model termed PETformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that PETformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on eight commonly used public datasets for LTSF, surpassing all existing models. The insights and enhancement methodologies presented in this paper serve as valuable reference points and sources of inspiration for future research endeavors.\n@article{petformer,\n  title={Petformer: Long-term time series forecasting via placeholder-enhanced transformer},\n  author={Lin, Shengsheng and Lin, Weiwei and Wu, Wentai and Wang, Songbo and Wang, Yongxiang},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.04791},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\n@article{segrnn,\n  title={Segrnn: Segment recurrent neural network for long-term time series forecasting},\n  author={Lin, Shengsheng and Lin, Weiwei and Wu, Wentai and Zhao, Feiyu and Mo, Ruichao and Zhang, Haotong},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2308.11200},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\nAbstract: One unique property of time series is that the temporal relations are largely preserved after downsampling into two sub-sequences. By taking advantage of this property, we propose a novel neural network architecture that conducts sample convolution and interaction for temporal modeling and forecasting, named SCINet. Specifically, SCINet is a recursive downsample-convolve-interact architecture. In each layer, we use multiple convolutional filters to extract distinct yet valuable temporal features from the downsampled sub-sequences or features. By combining these rich features aggregated from multiple resolutions, SCINet effectively models time series with complex temporal dynamics. Experimental results show that SCINet achieves significant forecasting accuracy improvements over both existing convolutional models and Transformer-based solutions across various real-world time series forecasting datasets.

And they do not allow for targeted modeling of local features as CNN structures do. To solve the above problems, we propose to combine local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series (e.g., fluctuations, trends). To fully exploit the underlying information in the time series, a multi-scale branch structure is adopted to model different potential patterns separately. Each pattern is extracted with down-sampled convolution and isometric convolution for local features and global correlations, respectively. In addition to being more effective, our proposed method, termed as Multi-scale Isometric Convolution Network (MICN), is more efficient with linear complexity about the sequence length with suitable convolution kernels. Our experiments on six benchmark datasets show that compared with state-of-the-art methods, MICN yields 17.2% and 21.6% relative improvements for multivariate and univariate time series, respectively.

Theoretically, we prove that the simplest linear analogue of our model can achieve near optimal error rate for linear dynamical systems (LDS) under some assumptions.

Deep train-from-scratch models have exhibited effective performance yet require large amounts of data, which limits real-world applicability. Recently, researchers have leveraged the representation learning transferability of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle limited non-linguistic datasets effectively. However, incorporating LLMs with time-series data presents challenges of limited adaptation due to different compositions between time-series and linguistic data, and the inability to process multi-scale temporal information. To tackle these challenges, we propose LLM4TS, a framework for time-series forecasting with pre-trained LLMs. LLM4TS consists of a two-stage fine-tuning strategy: the \\textit{time-series alignment} stage to align LLMs with the nuances of time-series data, and the \\textit{forecasting fine-tuning} stage for downstream time-series forecasting tasks. Furthermore, our framework features a novel two-level aggregation method that integrates multi-scale temporal data within pre-trained LLMs, enhancing their ability to interpret time-specific information. In experiments across 7 time-series forecasting datasets, LLM4TS is superior to existing state-of-the-art methods compared with trained-from-scratch models in full-shot scenarios, and also achieves an average improvement of 6.84% in MSE in few-shot scenarios. In addition, evaluations compared with different self-supervised learning approaches highlight LLM4TS's effectiveness with representation learning in forecasting tasks.\n@misc{llm4ts,\n      title={LLM4TS: Aligning Pre-Trained LLMs as Data-Efficient Time-Series Forecasters}, \n      author={Ching Chang and Wei-Yao Wang and Wen-Chih Peng and Tien-Fu Chen},\n      year={2024},\n      eprint={2308.08469},\n      archivePrefix={arXiv},\n      primaryClass={cs.LG}\n}\n\nAbstract: Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.\n@article{timellm,\n  title={Time-llm: Time series forecasting by reprogramming large language models},\n  author={Jin, Ming and Wang, Shiyu and Ma, Lintao and Chu, Zhixuan and Zhang, James Y and Shi, Xiaoming and Chen, Pin-Yu and Liang, Yuxuan and Li, Yuan-Fang and Pan, Shirui and others},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2310.01728},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\nAbstract: This paper presents a new perspective on time series forecasting. In existing time series forecasting methods, the models take a sequence of numerical values as input and yield numerical values as output. The existing SOTA models are largely based on the Transformer architecture, modified with multiple encoding mechanisms to incorporate the context and semantics around the historical data. Inspired by the successes of pre-trained language foundation models, we pose a question about whether these models can also be adapted to solve time-series forecasting. Thus, we propose a new forecasting paradigm: prompt-based time series forecasting (PromptCast). In this novel task, the numerical input and output are transformed into prompts and the forecasting task is framed in a sentence-to-sentence manner, making it possible to directly apply language models for forecasting purposes. To support and facilitate the research of this task, we also present a large-scale dataset (PISA) that includes three real-world forecasting scenarios. We evaluate different SOTA numerical-based forecasting methods and language generation models. The benchmark results with various forecasting settings demonstrate the proposed PromptCast with language generation models is a promising research direction. Additionally, in comparison to conventional numerical-based forecasting, PromptCast shows a much better generalization ability under the zero-shot setting.\n@article{promptcast,\n  title={Promptcast: A new prompt-based learning paradigm for time series forecasting},\n  author={Xue, Hao and Salim, Flora D},\n  journal={IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering},\n  year={2023},\n  publisher={IEEE}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: Recently, multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting techniques have seen rapid development and widespread applications across various fields. Transformer-based and GNN-based methods have shown promising potential due to their strong ability to model interaction of time and variables. However, by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the real-world data, we observe that the temporal fluctuations and heterogeneity between variables are not well handled by existing methods. To address the above issues, we propose CrossGNN, a linear complexity GNN model to refine the cross-scale and cross-variable interaction for MTS. To deal with the unexpected noise in time dimension, an adaptive multi-scale identifier (AMSI) is leveraged to construct multi-scale time series with reduced noise. A Cross-Scale GNN is proposed to extract the scales with clearer trend and weaker noise. Cross-Variable GNN is proposed to utilize the homogeneity and heterogeneity between different variables. By simultaneously focusing on edges with higher saliency scores and constraining those edges with lower scores, the time and space complexity (i.e., O ( L ) ) of CrossGNN can be linear with the input sequence length L . Extensive experimental results on 8 real-world MTS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossGNN compared with state-of-the-art methods.

The multivariate forecasting models need to capture the relationship between the channels to accurately predict future values. However, recently, there has been an emergence of methods that employ the Channel Independent (CI) strategy. These methods view multivariate time series data as separate univariate time series and disregard the correlation between channels. Surprisingly, our empirical results have shown that models trained with the CI strategy outperform those trained with the Channel Dependent (CD) strategy, usually by a significant margin. Nevertheless, the reasons behind this phenomenon have not yet been thoroughly explored in the literature. This paper provides comprehensive empirical and theoretical analyses of the characteristics of multivariate time series datasets and the CI/CD strategy. Our results conclude that the CD approach has higher capacity but often lacks robustness to accurately predict distributionally drifted time series. In contrast, the CI approach trades capacity for robust prediction. Practical measures inspired by these analyses are proposed to address the capacity and robustness dilemma, including a modified CD method called Predict Residuals with Regularization (PRReg) that can surpass the CI strategy. We hope our findings can raise awareness among researchers about the characteristics of multivariate time series and inspire the construction of better forecasting models.\n@article{CIorCD,\n  title={The capacity and robustness trade-off: Revisiting the channel independent strategy for multivariate time series forecasting},\n  author={Han, Lu and Ye, Han-Jia and Zhan, De-Chuan},\n  journal={IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering},\n  year={2024},\n  publisher={IEEE}\n}\n\nAbstract: Statistical properties such as mean and variance often change over time in time series, i.e., time-series data suffer from a distribution shift problem. This change in temporal distribution is one of the main challenges that prevent accurate timeseries forecasting. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective normalization method called reversible instance normalization (RevIN), a generallyapplicable normalization-and-denormalization method with learnable affine transformation. The proposed method is symmetrically structured to remove and restore the statistical information of a time-series instance, leading to significant performance improvements in time-series forecasting, as shown in Fig. 1. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RevIN via extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on various real-world datasets, addressing the distribution shift problem. ∗Both authors contributed equally.

Among multiple advantages of Transformers, the ability to capture long-range dependencies and interactions is especially attractive for time series modeling, leading to exciting progress in various time series applications. In this paper, we systematically review Transformer schemes for time series modeling by highlighting their strengths as well as limitations. In particular, we examine the development of time series Transformers in two perspectives. From the perspective of network structure, we summarize the adaptations and modifications that have been made to Transformers in order to accommodate the challenges in time series analysis. From the perspective of applications, we categorize time series Transformers based on common tasks including forecasting, anomaly detection, and classification. Empirically, we perform robust analysis, model size analysis, and seasonal-trend decomposition analysis to study how Transformers perform in time series. Finally, we discuss and suggest future directions to provide useful research guidance.\n@article{trans_time_survey,\n  title={Transformers in time series: A survey},\n  author={Wen, Qingsong and Zhou, Tian and Zhang, Chaoli and Chen, Weiqi and Ma, Ziqing and Yan, Junchi and Sun, Liang},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.07125},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: While the Transformer architecture has become the de-facto standard for natural language processing tasks, its applications to computer vision remain limited. In vision, attention is either applied in conjunction with convolutional networks, or used to replace certain components of convolutional networks while keeping their overall structure in place. We show that this reliance on CNNs is not necessary and a pure transformer applied directly to sequences of image patches can perform very well on image classification tasks. When pre-trained on large amounts of data and transferred to multiple mid-sized or small image recognition benchmarks (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, VTAB, etc.), Vision Transformer (ViT) attains excellent results compared to state-of-the-art convolutional networks while requiring substantially fewer computational resources to train.\n@article{vit,\n  title={An image is worth 16x16 words: Transformers for image recognition at scale},\n  author={Dosovitskiy, Alexey and Beyer, Lucas and Kolesnikov, Alexander and Weissenborn, Dirk and Zhai, Xiaohua and Unterthiner, Thomas and Dehghani, Mostafa and Minderer, Matthias and Heigold, Georg and Gelly, Sylvain and others},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2010.11929},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\nAbstract: This paper shows that masked autoencoders (MAE) are scalable self-supervised learners for computer vision. Our MAE approach is simple: we mask random patches of the input image and reconstruct the missing pixels. It is based on two core designs. First, we develop an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture, with an encoder that operates only on the visible subset of patches (without mask tokens), along with a lightweight decoder that reconstructs the original image from the latent representation and mask tokens. Second, we find that masking a high proportion of the input image, e.g., 75%, yields a nontrivial and meaningful self-supervisory task. Coupling these two designs enables us to train large models efficiently and effectively: we accelerate training (by 3× or more) and improve accuracy. Our scalable approach allows for learning high-capacity models that generalize well: e.g., a vanilla ViT-Huge model achieves the best accuracy (87.8%) among methods that use only ImageNet-1K data. Transfer performance in downstream tasks outperforms supervised pretraining and shows promising scaling behavior.\n@inproceedings{MAE,\n  title={Masked autoencoders are scalable vision learners},\n  author={He, Kaiming and Chen, Xinlei and Xie, Saining and Li, Yanghao and Doll{\\'a}r, Piotr and Girshick, Ross},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition},\n  pages={16000--16009},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\nAbstract: For most deep learning practitioners, sequence modeling is synonymous with recurrent networks. Yet recent results indicate that convolutional architectures can outperform recurrent networks on tasks such as audio synthesis and machine translation. Given a new sequence modeling task or dataset, which architecture should one use? We conduct a systematic evaluation of generic convolutional and recurrent architectures for sequence modeling. The models are evaluated across a broad range of standard tasks that are commonly used to benchmark recurrent networks. Our results indicate that a simple convolutional architecture outperforms canonical recurrent networks such as LSTMs across a diverse range of tasks and datasets, while demonstrating longer effective memory. We conclude that the common association between sequence modeling and recurrent networks should be reconsidered, and convolutional networks should be regarded as a natural starting point for sequence modeling tasks.

While longer sequences inherently convey richer information, potentially enhancing predictive precision, prevailing techniques often respond by escalating model complexity. These intricate models can inflate into millions of parameters, incorporating parameter-intensive elements like positional encodings, feed-forward networks and self-attention mechanisms. This complexity, however, leads to prohibitive model scale, particularly given the time series data’s semantic simplicity. Motivated by the pursuit of parsimony, our research employs conditional correlation and auto-correlation as investigative tools, revealing significant redundancies within the input data. Leveraging these insights, we introduce the HDformer, a lightweight Transformer variant enhanced with hierarchical decomposition. This novel architecture not only inverts the prevailing trend toward model expansion but also accomplishes precise forecasting with drastically fewer computations and parameters. Remarkably, HDformer outperforms existing state-of-the-art LTSF models, while requiring over 99% fewer parameters. Through this work, we advocate a paradigm shift in LTSF, emphasizing the importance to tailor the model to the inherent dynamics of time series data—a timely reminder that in the realm of LTSF, bigger is not invariably better.\n@article{HDformer,\n  title={The bigger the better? rethinking the effective model scale in long-term time series forecasting},\n  author={Deng, Jinliang and Song, Xuan and Tsang, Ivor W and Xiong, Hui},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2401.11929},\n  year={2024}\n}\n\nAbstract: Multivariate time series forecasting has seen widely ranging applications in various domains, including finance, traffic, energy, and healthcare. To capture the sophisticated temporal patterns, plenty of research studies designed complex neural network architectures based on many variants of RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. However, complex models are often computationally expensive and thus face a severe challenge in training and inference efficiency when applied to large-scale real-world datasets. In this paper, we introduce LightTS, a light deep learning architecture merely based on simple MLP-based structures. The key idea of LightTS is to apply an MLP-based structure on top of two delicate down-sampling strategies, including interval sampling and continuous sampling, inspired by a crucial fact that down-sampling time series often preserves the majority of its information. We conduct extensive experiments on eight widely used benchmark datasets. Compared with the existing state-of-the-art methods, LightTS demonstrates better performance on five of them and comparable performance on the rest. Moreover, LightTS is highly efficient. It uses less than 5% FLOPS compared with previous SOTA methods on the largest benchmark dataset. In addition, LightTS is robust and has a much smaller variance in forecasting accuracy than previous SOTA methods in long sequence forecasting tasks.\n@article{lightts,\n  title={Less is more: Fast multivariate time series forecasting with light sampling-oriented mlp structures},\n  author={Zhang, Tianping and Zhang, Yizhuo and Cao, Wei and Bian, Jiang and Yi, Xiaohan and Zheng, Shun and Li, Jian},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2207.01186},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\n\n@article{gru,\n  title={Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation},\n  author={Cho, Kyunghyun and Van Merri{\\\"e}nboer, Bart and Gulcehre, Caglar and Bahdanau, Dzmitry and Bougares, Fethi and Schwenk, Holger and Bengio, Yoshua},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1406.1078},\n  year={2014}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: A ordered sequence of events or observations having a time component is called as a time series.

Therefore, they cannot always efficiently support real-time analysis that demands low processing delay. To address this challenge, we propose OneShotSTL, an efficient and accurate algorithm that can decompose time series online with an update time complexity of\n O\n (1). OneShotSTL is more than 1, 000 times faster than the batch methods, with accuracy comparable to the best counterparts.

Recently, some methods have employed patching to enhance local semantics and improve model performance. However, length-fixed patch are prone to losing temporal boundary information, such as complete peaks and periods. Moreover, existing methods mainly focus on modeling long-term dependencies across patches, while paying little attention to other dimensions (e.g., short-term dependencies within patches and complex interactions among cross-variavle patches). To address these challenges, we propose a pure MLP-based HDMixer, aiming to acquire patches with richer semantic information and efficiently modeling hierarchical interactions. Specifically, we design a Length-Extendable Patcher (LEP) tailored to MTS, which enriches the boundary information of patches and alleviates semantic incoherence in series. Subsequently, we devise a Hierarchical Dependency Explorer (HDE) based on pure MLPs.

Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains : traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The results offer a deeper understanding of the forecasting methods, allowing us to better select the ones that are most suitable for particular datasets and settings. Overall, TFB and this evaluation provide researchers with improved means of designing new TSF methods.\n@article{TFB,\n  title={TFB: Towards Comprehensive and Fair Benchmarking of Time Series Forecasting Methods},\n  author={Qiu, Xiangfei and Hu, Jilin and Zhou, Lekui and Wu, Xingjian and Du, Junyang and Zhang, Buang and Guo, Chenjuan and Zhou, Aoying and Jensen, Christian S and Sheng, Zhenli and others},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2403.20150},\n  year={2024}\n}The above content represents the relevant literature in this field.

However, achieving precise forecasts over extended horizons is challenging due to the complexity of capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Existing models like RNNs, TCNs, and Transformers, while powerful, are computationally intensive and often have millions of parameters, limiting their practical usability in resource-constrained environments. These models struggle to effectively extract periodicity and trend from time series data, which are essential for accurate long-term forecasting. The basis for accurate LTSF lies in the inherent periodicity and trend of the data, such as daily and weekly patterns in household electricity consumption. This periodicity and trend can be decomposed and transformed into inter-subsequence dynamics and intra-subsequence characteristics, respectively. However, current models do not efficiently utilize this decomposition, leading to inefficiencies in parameter usage and computational resources. This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel, extremely lightweight model that leverages the inherent periodicity and trend in time series data to achieve competitive or superior performance with minimal computational resources.\n\n## Main Idea\n\nThe paper introduces SparseTSF, a novel lightweight model for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) that utilizes the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique.

Furthermore, SparseTSF showcases remarkable generalization capabilities, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited computational resources, small samples, or low-quality data.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\n\n\\label{introduction}\n\nTime series forecasting holds significant value in domains such as traffic flow, product sales, and energy consumption, as accurate predictions enable decision-makers to plan proactively. Achieving precise forecasts typically relies on powerful yet complex deep learning models, such as RNNs~\\citep{RNN_NC}, TCNs~\\citep{TCN,TCN2}, and Transformers~\\citep{trans_time_survey}. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), which demands models to provide an extended predictive view for advanced planning \\citep{informer}.\n\nAlthough a longer predictive horizon offers convenience, it also introduces greater uncertainty \\citep{segrnn}. This demands models capable of extracting more extensive temporal dependencies from longer historical windows. Consequently, modeling becomes more complex to capture these long-term temporal dependencies. For instance, Transformer-based models often have millions or tens of millions of parameters, limiting their practical usability, especially in scenarios with restricted computational resources \\citep{HDformer}.\n\nIn fact, the basis for accurate long-term time series forecasting lies in the inherent periodicity and trend of the data. For example, long-term forecasts of household electricity consumption are feasible due to the clear daily and weekly patterns in such data. Particularly for daily patterns, if we \\textit{resample} the electricity consumption at a certain time of the day into a daily sequence, each subsequence exhibits similar or consistent trends. In this case, the original sequence's periodicity and trend are decomposed and transformed. That is, periodic patterns are transformed into \\textit{inter-subsequence} dynamics, while trend patterns are reinterpreted as \\textit{intra-subsequence} characteristics. This decomposition offers a novel perspective for designing lightweight LTSF models.\n\nIn this paper, we pioneer the exploration of how to utilize this inherent periodicity and decomposition in data to construct specialized lightweight time series forecasting models. Specifically, we introduce \\textbf{\\textit{SparseTSF}}, an extremely lightweight LTSF model. Technically, we propose the \\textit{Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting} technique (hereinafter referred to as Sparse technique). It first downsamples the original sequences with constant periodicity into subsequences, then performs predictions on each downsampled subsequence, simplifying the original time series forecasting task into a cross-period trend prediction task. This approach yields two benefits: (i) effective decoupling of data periodicity and trend, enabling the model to stably identify and extract periodic features while focusing on predicting trend changes, and (ii) extreme compression of the model's parameter size, significantly reducing the demand for computational resources. As shown in Figure~\\ref{fig1}, SparseTSF achieves near state-of-the-art prediction performance with less than \\textbf{\\textit{1k}} trainable parameters, which makes it \\textit{1\\(\\sim\\)4 orders of magnitude smaller} than its counterparts.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/fig1.pdf}\n    \\caption{Comparison of MSE and parameters between SparseTSF and other mainstream models on the Electricity dataset with a forecast horizon of 720.}\n    \\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn summary, our contributions in this paper are as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We propose a novel \\textit{Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting} technique, which downsamples the original sequences to focus on cross-period trend prediction, effectively extracting periodic features while minimizing the model’s complexity and parameter count.\n    \\item Based on the Sparse technique, we present the \\textit{SparseTSF} model, which requires fewer than \\textit{1k} parameters, significantly reducing the computational resource demand of forecasting models.\n    \\item The proposed SparseTSF model not only attains competitive or surpasses state-of-the-art predictive accuracy with a remarkably minimal parameter scale but also demonstrates robust generalization capabilities.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\\label{related_work}\n\n\\paragraph{Development of Long-term Time Series Forecasting}\nThe LTSF tasks, which aim at predicting over an extended horizon, are inherently more challenging. Initially, the Transformer architecture \\citep{transformer}, known for its robust long-term dependency modeling capabilities, gained widespread attention in the LTSF domain. Models such as Informer~\\citep{informer}, Autoformer~\\citep{autoformer}, and FEDformer~\\citep{fedformer} have modified the native structure of Transformer to suit time series forecasting tasks. More recent advancements, like PatchTST~\\citep{patchtst} and PETformer~\\citep{petformer}, demonstrate that the original Transformer architecture can achieve impressive results with an appropriate patch strategy, a technique that is prevalently employed in the realm of computer vision \\citep{vit,MAE}. Besides Transformer architectures, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) are also mainstream approaches, including SCINet~\\citep{scinet}, TimesNet~\\citep{timesnet}, MICN~\\citep{micn}, TiDE~\\citep{tide}, and HDMixer~\\citep{HDMixer}. Recent studies have shown that transferring pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) to the time series domain can also yield commendable results \\citep{llm4ts, timellm, promptcast}. Moreover, recent works have revealed that RNN and GNN networks can also perform well in LTSF tasks, as exemplified by SegRNN~\\citep{segrnn} and CrossGNN~\\citep{crossgnn}.\n\n\\paragraph{Progress in Lightweight Forecasting Models}\nSince DLinear~\\citep{dlinear} demonstrated that simple models could already extract strong temporal periodic dependencies, numerous studies have been pushing LTSF models towards lightweight designs, including LightTS\\citep{lightts}, TiDE~\\citep{tide}, TSMixer~\\citep{TSMixer}, and HDformer~\\citep{HDformer}. Recently, FITS emerged as a milestone in the lightweight LTSF process, being the first to reduce the LTSF model scale to the \\textit{10k} parameter level while maintaining excellent predictive performance \\citep{fits}. FITS achieved this by transforming time-domain forecasting tasks into frequency-domain ones and using low-pass filters to reduce the required number of parameters. In this paper, our proposed SparseTSF model takes lightweight model design to the extreme. Utilizing the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique, it's the first to reduce model parameters to below \\textit{1k}.\n\n\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\n\\label{methodology}\n\\subsection{Preliminaries}\n\n\\paragraph{Long-term Time Series Forecasting}\nThe task of LTSF involves predicting future values over an extended horizon using previously observed multivariate time series (MTS) data. It is formalized as \\(\\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} = f(x_{t-L+1:t})\\), where \\(x_{t-L+1:t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times C}\\) and \\(\\bar{x}_{t+1:t+H} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H \\times C}\\). In this formulation, \\(L\\) represents the length of the historical observation window, \\(C\\) is the number of distinct features or channels, and \\(H\\) is the length of the forecast horizon. The main goal of LTSF is to extend the forecast horizon \\(H\\) as it provides richer and more advanced guidance in practical applications. However, an extended forecast horizon \\(H\\) also increases the complexity of the model, leading to a significant increase in parameters in mainstream models. To address this challenge, our research focuses on developing models that are not only extremely lightweight but also robust and effective.\n\n\\paragraph{Channel Independent Strategy}\nRecent advancements in the field of LTSF have seen a shift towards a Channel Independent (CI) approach, especially when dealing with multivariate time series data \\citep{CIorCD}. This strategy simplifies the forecasting process by focusing on individual univariate time series within the dataset. Instead of the traditional approach, which utilizes the entire multivariate historical data to predict future outcomes, the CI method finds a shared function \\(f: x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L} \\rightarrow \\bar{x}^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{H}\\) for each univariate series. This approach provides a more targeted and simplified prediction model for each channel, reducing the complexity of accounting for inter-channel relationships.\n\nAs a result, the main goal of mainstream state-of-the-art models in recent years has shifted towards effectively predict by modeling long-term dependencies, including periodicity and trends, in univariate sequences. For instance, models like DLinear achieve this by extracting dominant periodicity from univariate sequences using a single linear layer \\citep{dlinear}. More advanced models, such as PatchTST~\\citep{patchtst} and TiDE~\\citep{tide}, employ more complex structures on single channels to extract temporal dependencies, aiming for superior predictive performance. In this paper, we adopt this CI strategy as well and focus on how to create an even more lightweight yet effective approach for capturing long-term dependencies in single-channel time series.\n\n\\subsection{SparseTSF}\n\nGiven that the data to be forecasted often exhibits constant, periodicity a priori (e.g., electricity consumption and traffic flow typically have fixed daily cycles), we propose the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique to enhance the extraction of long-term sequential dependencies while reducing the model's parameter scale. Utilizing a single linear layer to model the LTSF task within this framework leads to our SparseTSF model, as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig2}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[!htb]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.9\\linewidth]{figs/fig2.pdf}\n    \\caption{SparseTSF architecture.}\n    \\label{fig2}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\paragraph{Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting}\nAssuming that the time series \\(x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t}\\) has a known periodicity \\(w\\), the first step is to downsample the original series into \\(w\\) subsequences of length \\(n=\\left \\lfloor \\frac{L}{w}  \\right \\rfloor\\). A model with shared parameters is then applied to these subsequences for prediction. After prediction, the \\(w\\) subsequences, each of length \\(m=\\left \\lfloor \\frac{H}{w}  \\right \\rfloor\\), are upsampled back to a complete forecast sequence of length \\(H\\).\n\nIntuitively, this forecasting process appears as a sliding forecast with a sparse interval of \\(w\\), performed by a fully connected layer with parameter sharing within a constant period \\(w\\). This can be viewed as a model performing sparse sliding prediction across periods.\n\nTechnically, the downsampling process is equivalent to reshaping \\(x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t}\\) into a \\(n \\times w\\) matrix, which is then transposed to a \\(w \\times n\\) matrix. The sparse sliding prediction is equivalent to applying a linear layer of size \\(n \\times m\\) on the last dimension of the matrix, resulting in a \\(w \\times m\\) matrix. The upsampling step is equivalent to transposing the \\(w \\times m\\) matrix and reshaping it back into a complete forecast sequence of length \\(H\\).\n\nHowever, this approach currently still faces two issues: (i) loss of information, as only one data point per period is utilized for prediction, while the rest are ignored; and (ii) amplification of the impact of outliers, as the presence of extreme values in the downsampled subsequences can directly affect the prediction.\n\nTo address these issues, we \\textit{additionally} perform a sliding aggregation on the original sequence before executing sparse prediction, as depicted in Figure~\\ref{fig2}. Each aggregated data point incorporates information from other points within its surrounding period, addressing issue (i). Moreover, as the aggregated value is essentially a weighted average of surrounding points, it mitigates the impact of outliers, thus resolving issue (ii). Technically, this sliding aggregation can be implemented using a 1D convolution with zero-padding and a kernel size of \\( 2 \\times \\left \\lfloor \\frac{w}{2}  \\right \\rfloor\\ + 1\\). The process can be formulated as follows:\n\\begin{align}\nx^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t} = x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t} + \\text{Conv1D}(x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t})\n\\end{align}\n\\paragraph{Instance Normalization}\nTime series data often exhibit distributional shifts between training and testing datasets. Recent studies have shown that employing simple sample normalization strategies between the input and output of models can help mitigate this issue \\citep{revin, dlinear}. In our work, we also utilize a straightforward normalization strategy. Specifically, we subtract the mean of the sequence from itself before it enters the model and add it back after the model's output. This process is formulated as follows:\n\\begin{align}\nx^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t} = x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t} - \\mathbb{E}_t(x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t}),\\\\\n\\bar{x}^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H} = \\bar{x}^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H} + \\mathbb{E}_t(x^{(i)}_{t-L+1:t}).\n\\end{align}\n\n\\paragraph{Loss Function}\nIn alignment with current mainstream practices in the field, we adopt the classic Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function for SparseTSF. This function measures the discrepancy between the predicted values \\(\\bar{x}^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H}\\) and the actual ground truth \\(y^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H}\\). It is formulated as:\n\\begin{align}\n\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{1}{C}\\sum_{i=1}^{C}\\left \\| y^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H} - \\bar{x}^{(i)}_{t+1:t+H}  \\right \\|_{2}^{2}.\n\\end{align}\n\\subsection{Theoretical Analysis}\n\\label{theoretical_analysis}\n\nIn this section, we provide a theoretical analysis of the SparseTSF model, focusing on its parameter efficiency and the effectiveness of the Sparse technique.\n\n\\subsubsection{Parameter Efficiency of SparseTSF}\n\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{theorem1}\nGiven a historical look-back window length \\(L\\), a forecast horizon \\(H\\), and a constant periodicity \\(w\\), the total number of parameters required for the SparseTSF model is \\( \\left \\lfloor \\frac{L}{w} \\right \\rfloor \\times \\left \\lfloor \\frac{H}{w} \\right \\rfloor + 2 \\times \\left \\lfloor \\frac{w}{2}  \\right \\rfloor\\ + 1 \\).\n\\end{theorem}\n\nIn LTSF tasks, the look-back window length \\(L\\) and forecast horizon \\(H\\) are usually quite large, for instance, up to 720, while the intrinsic periodicity \\(w\\) of the data is also typically large, such as 24. In this scenario, \\( \\left \\lfloor \\frac{L}{w} \\right \\rfloor \\times \\left \\lfloor \\frac{H}{w} \\right \\rfloor + 2 \\times \\left \\lfloor \\frac{w}{2} \\right \\rfloor + 1 \\ll L \\times H \\). This means that the parameter scale of the SparseTSF model is much lighter than even the simplest single-layer linear model. This demonstrates the lightweight architecture of the SparseTSF model.\n\n\\subsubsection{Effectiveness of SparseTSF}\nThe time series targeted for long-term forecasting often exhibits constant periodicity. Here, we first define the representation of such a sequence \\( X \\).\n\n\\begin{definition}\n\\label{definition}\nConsider a \\textit{univariate} time series \\( X \\) with a known period \\( w \\), which can be decomposed into a periodic component \\( P(t) \\) and a trend component \\( T(t) \\), such that \\( X(t) = P(t) + T(t) \\). Here, \\( P(t) \\) represents the periodic part and satisfies the condition:\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{periodic_func}\nP(t) = P(t + w).\n\\end{align}\n\\end{definition}\n\nFurthermore, we can derive the form of the modeling task after downsampling.\n\nIn the context of a truncated subsequence \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\) of \\( X(t) \\) and its corresponding future sequence \\( x_{t+1:t+H} \\) to be forecasted, the conventional approach involves using \\( x_{t-L+1:t} \\) directly to predict \\( x_{t+1:t+H} \\), essentially estimating the function:\n\\begin{align}\nx_{t+1:t+H} = f(x_{t-L+1:t})\n\\end{align}\nHowever, with the application of the Sparse technique, this forecasting task transforms into predicting downsampled subsequences, as per Lemma~\\ref{lemma}.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\n\\label{lemma}\nThe SparseTSF model reformulates the forecasting task into predicting downsampled subsequences, namely:\n\\begin{align}\nx'_{t+1:t+m} = f(x'_{t-n+1:t})\n\\end{align}\n\\end{lemma}\n\nCombining Definition~\\ref{definition} and Lemma~\\ref{lemma}, we can further deduce Theorem~\\ref{theorem2}.\n\\begin{theorem}\n\\label{theorem2}\nGiven a time series dataset that satisfies Definition~\\ref{definition}, the SparseTSF model's formulation becomes:\n\\begin{align}\np'_{t+1:t+m}+t'_{t+1:t+m} = f(p'_{t-n+1:t}+t'_{t-n+1:t})\n\\end{align}\nwhere, for any \\(i \\in [t-n+1:t+m]\\) and \\(j \\in [t-n+1:t+m]\\), satisfying:\n\\begin{align}\np'_i = p'_j\n\\end{align}\n\\end{theorem}\n\nTheorem~\\ref{theorem2} implies that the task of the SparseTSF model effectively transforms into predicting future \\textit{trend} components (i.e., \\(t'\\)), using the \\textit{constant} periodic components (i.e., \\(p'\\)) as a reference. This process effectively separates the periodic components, which are no longer explicitly modeled, allowing the model to focus more on the trend variations.\n\nIntuitively, We can further validate this finding from the perspective of \\textit{autocorrelation}, a powerful tool for identifying patterns such as seasonality or periodicity in time series data.\n\n\\begin{definition}[AutoCorrelation Function (ACF) \\citep{acf}]\n\\label{definition2}\nGiven a time series \\( \\{X_t\\} \\), where \\( t \\) represents discrete time points, the ACF at lag \\( k \\) is defined as:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\text{ACF}(k) = \\frac{\\sum_{t=1}^{N-k} (X_t - \\mu)(X_{t+k} - \\mu)}{\\sum_{t=1}^{N} (X_t - \\mu)^2}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere \\( N \\) is the total number of observations in the time series, \\( X_t \\) is the value of the series at time \\( t \\), \\( X_{t+k} \\) is the value of the series at time \\( t+k \\), and \\( \\mu \\) is the mean of the series \\( \\{X_t\\} \\). \n\\end{definition}\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htb]  \n    \\centering\n    \\subcaptionbox{Original}{\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\linewidth]{figs/etth1a.pdf}} \\label{fig3a}\n    \\subcaptionbox{Downsampled}{\\includegraphics[width=0.48\\linewidth]{figs/etth1b.pdf}}\n    \\label{fig3b}\n    \\caption{Comparison of autocorrelation in original and downsampled subsequences for the first channel in the ETTh1 dataset.}\n    \\label{fig3}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe lag time \\( k \\) in the ACF reveals the periodic patterns in the series, that is, when \\( k \\) equals the periodic length of the series, the ACF value typically shows a significant peak. As shown in Figure~\\ref{fig3}, the original sequence exhibits clear periodicity, while the downsampled subsequences retain only trend characteristics. This demonstrates that, through its downsampling strategy, the SparseTSF model can efficiently separate and extract accurate periodic features from time series data. This not only reduces the complexity of the model but also enables it to focus on predicting trend variations, thereby exhibiting impressive performance in LTSF tasks.\nIn summary, the SparseTSF model's design, characterized by its parameter efficiency and focus on decoupling periodic features, makes it well-suited for LTSF tasks, especially in scenarios where the data exhibits clear periodic patterns. \n\n\n\n```\n\n## Experimental Setup\n\n```json\n[{\"name\": \"Main Results\", \"description\": \"The main experiment compares the performance of SparseTSF with other state-of-the-art and representative methods in the field on four mainstream LTSF datasets: ETTh1, ETTh2, Electricity, and Traffic.

It is observable that SparseTSF ranks within the top two in all scenarios, achieving or closely approaching state-of-the-art levels with a significantly smaller parameter scale. This emphatically demonstrates the superiority of the Sparse technique proposed in this paper. Specifically, the Sparse technique is capable of more effectively extracting the periodicity and trends from data, thereby enabling exceptional predictive performance in long horizon scenarios. Additionally, the standard deviation of SparseTSF's results is notably small. In most cases, the standard deviation across 5 runs is within 0.001, which strongly indicates the robustness of the SparseTSF model.\n\\subsection{Efficiency Advantages of SparseTSF}\n\nBeyond its powerful predictive performance, another significant benefit of the SparseTSF model is its extreme lightweight nature.

It is evident that SparseTSF significantly outperforms other models in terms of static metrics like the number of parameters and MACs, being over ten times smaller than the next best model. This characteristic allows SparseTSF to be deployed on devices with very limited computational resources. Furthermore, in terms of runtime metrics, Max Memory and Epoch Time, SparseTSF significantly outperforms other mainstream models, rivaling the existing lightweight models (i.e., DLinear and FITS). Herein, DLinear benefits from a shorter look-back length, achieving the lowest overhead, while FITS and SparseTSF incur additional overhead due to extra operations (i.e., Fourier transformation and resampling).\n\n\\begin{table}[!htb]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison of the scale of parameters on Electricity dataset between SparseTSF and FITS models under different configurations of look-back length and forecast horizon, where SparseTSF operates with \\(w=24\\) and FITS employs COF at the \\(2^{th}\\) harmonic.}\n\\label{parameters}\n\\begin{adjustbox}{max width=\\linewidth}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc|cccc}\n\\toprule\nModel & \\multicolumn{4}{c|}{SparseTSF (Ours)} & \\multicolumn{4}{c}{FITS~\\citeyearpar{fits}} \\\\ \\midrule\n\\diagbox{Horizon}{Look-back} & 96 & 192 & 336 & 720 & 96 & 192 & 336 & 720 \\\\ \\midrule\n\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{96} & 41 & 57 & 81 & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{145} & 840 & 1,218 & 2,091 & 5,913 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{192} & 57 & 89 & 137 & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{265} & 1,260 & 1,624 & 2,542 & 6,643 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{336} & 81 & 137 & 221 & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{445} & 1,890 & 2,233 & 3,280 & 7,665 \\\\\n\\multicolumn{1}{c|}{720} & 145 & 265 & 445 & \\multicolumn{1}{c|}{925} & 3,570 & 3,857 & 5,125 & 10,512 \\\\ \\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{adjustbox}\n\\end{table}\n\nAdditionally, we conducted a comprehensive comparison with FITS, a recent milestone work in the field of LTSF model lightweight progression.

Therefore, SparseTSF marks another significant advancement in the journey towards lightweight LTSF models.\n\\subsection{Ablation Studies and Analysis}\nBeyond its ultra-lightweight characteristics, the Sparse technique also possesses a robust capability to extract periodic features, which we will delve further into in this section.\n\n\\begin{table}[!htb]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Ablation MSE results of the Sparse technique.

Additionally, the Sparse technique can be integrated with other foundational models, including the Transformer~\\citep{transformer} and GRU~\\citep{gru} models. As demonstrated in the results of Table~\\ref{ablation}, the incorporation of the Sparse technique significantly enhances the performance of all models, including Linear, Transformer, and GRU. Specifically, the Linear model showed an average improvement of 4.7\\%, the Transformer by 21.4\\%, and the GRU by 12.4\\%. These results emphatically illustrate the efficacy of the Sparse technique. Therefore, the Sparse technique can substantially improve the performance of base models in LTSF tasks.\n\\paragraph{Representation Learning of the Sparse Technique}\nIn Section~\\ref{theoretical_analysis}, we theoretically analyzed the reasons why the Sparse technique can enhance the performance of forecasting tasks. Here, we further reveal the role of the Sparse technique from a representation learning perspective. Figure~\\ref{fig3} shows the distribution of normalized weights for both the trained Linear model and the SparseTSF model. The weight of the Linear model is an \\(L \\times H\\) matrix, which can be directly obtained. However, as the SparseTSF model is a sparse model, we need to acquire its equivalent weights. To do this, we first input \\(H\\) one-hot encoded vectors of length \\(L\\) into the SparseTSF model (when \\(L\\) equals \\(H\\), this can be simplified to a diagonal matrix, i.e., diagonal elements are 1, and other elements are 0). We then obtain and transpose the corresponding output to get the equivalent \\(L \\times H\\) weight matrix of SparseTSF. When \\(L\\) equals \\(H\\), this process is formulated as:\n\\begin{align}\n     {weight}'=\\textit{SparseTSF}(\\begin{bmatrix}\n     1 & 0 & \\dots  & 0\\\\\n     0 & 1 & \\dots & 0\\\\\n     \\dots & \\dots & \\dots & 0\\\\\n     0 & 0 & 0 & 1\\\\\n    \\end{bmatrix}) ^\\top.\n\\end{align}\n\\begin{figure*}[!htb]  \n    \\centering\n    \\subcaptionbox{Linear}{\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\linewidth]{figs/weight_etth1_l.pdf}} \\label{fig4a}\n    \\subcaptionbox{SparseTSF}{\\includegraphics[width=0.4\\linewidth]{figs/weight_etth1_s.pdf}}\n    \\label{fig4b}\n    \\caption{Visualization of normalized weights of the model trained on the ETTh1 dataset with both look-back length (X-axis) and forecast horizon (Y-axis) of 96.}\n    \\label{fig4}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nFrom the visualization in Figure~\\ref{fig4}, two observations can be made: (i) The Linear model can learn evenly spaced weight distribution stripes (i.e., periodic features) from the data, indicating that single linear layer can already extract the primary periodic characteristics from a univariate series with the CI strategy. These findings are consistent with previous research conclusions \\citep{dlinear}. (ii) Compared to the Linear model, SparseTSF learns more distinct evenly spaced weight distribution stripes, indicating that SparseTSF has a stronger capability in extracting periodic features. This phenomenon aligns with the conclusions of Section~\\ref{theoretical_analysis}.\n\nTherefore, the Sparse technique can enhance the model's performance in LTSF tasks by strengthening its ability to extract periodic features from data.\n\\paragraph{Impact of the Hyperparameter \\(w\\)}\n\nThe Sparse technique relies on the manual setting of the hyperparameter \\(w\\), which represents the a priori main period. Here, we delve into the influence of different values of \\(w\\) on the forecast outcomes. As indicated in the results from Table~\\ref{period}, SparseTSF exhibits optimal performance when \\(w=24\\), aligning with the intrinsic main period of the data. Conversely, when \\(w\\) diverges from 24, a slight decline in performance is observed. This suggests that the hyperparameter \\(w\\) should ideally be set consistent with the data's a priori main period.\n\n\\begin{table}[!htb]\n\\centering\n\\caption{MSE results of SparseTSF on ETTh1 with varied hyperparameters \\(w\\).}\n\\label{period}\n\\begin{adjustbox}{max width=\\linewidth}\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cccc|ccc}\n\\toprule\nHorizon & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}SparseTSF\\\\ (\\(w\\)=6)\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}SparseTSF\\\\ (\\(w\\)=12)\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}SparseTSF\\\\ (\\(w\\)=24)\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}SparseTSF\\\\ (\\(w\\)=48)\\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}FITS\\\\ \\citeyearpar{fits} \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}DLinear\\\\ \\citeyearpar{dlinear} \\end{tabular} & \\begin{tabular}[c]{@{}c@{}}PatchTST\\\\ \\citeyearpar{patchtst} \\end{tabular} \\\\ \\midrule\n96 & 0.376 & 0.369 & \\textbf{0.359} & 0.380 & 0.375 & 0.374 & 0.370 \\\\\n192 & 0.410 & 0.402 & \\textbf{0.397} & 0.400 & 0.408 & 0.405 & 0.413 \\\\\n336 & 0.408 & 0.406 & 0.404 & \\textbf{0.399} & 0.429 & 0.429 & 0.422 \\\\\n720 & 0.427 & 0.423 & \\textbf{0.417} & 0.427 & 0.427 & 0.440 & 0.447 \\\\\\midrule\nAvg. & 0.405 & 0.400 & \\textbf{0.394} & 0.402 & 0.410 & 0.412 & 0.413 \\\\ \\bottomrule\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{adjustbox}\n\\end{table}\n\nIn practical scenarios, datasets requiring long-term forecasting often exhibit inherent periodicity, such as daily or weekly cycles, common in domains like electricity, transportation, energy, and consumer goods consumption.  Therefore, empirically identifying the predominant period and setting the appropriate \\(w\\) for such data is both feasible and straightforward. However, for data lacking clear periodicity and patterns, such as financial data, current LTSF models may not be effective \\citep{dlinear}. Thus, the SparseTSF model may not be the preferred choice for these types of data. Nonetheless, we will further discuss the existing limitations and potential improvements of the SparseTSF model in the Section~\\ref{limits}.\n\n\\paragraph{Generalization Ability of the SparseTSF Model}\nThe Sparse technique enhances the model's ability to extract periodic features from data. Therefore, the generalization capability of a trained SparseTSF model on different datasets with the \\textit{same principal periodicity} is promising. To investigate this, we further studied the cross-domain generalization performance of the SparseTSF model (i.e., training on a dataset from one domain and testing on a dataset from another). Specifically, we examined the performance from ETTh2 to ETTh1, which are datasets of the same type but collected from different machines, each with 7 variables. Additionally, we explored the performance from Electricity to ETTh1, where these datasets originate from different domains and have a differing number of variables (i.e., Electricity has 321 variables). On datasets with different numbers of variables, models trained with traditional non-CI strategies (like Informer) cannot transfer, whereas those trained with CI strategies (like PatchTST) can, due to the decoupling of CI strategies from channel relationships. These datasets all have a daily periodicity, i.e., a prior predominant period of \\(w=24\\).\n\n\\begin{table}[!htb]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison of generalization capabilities between SparseTSF and other mainstream models.

It is expected that performance on ETTh2 to ETTh1 would be superior to Electricity to ETTh1. Furthermore, in both scenarios, the generalization performance of SparseTSF is nearly on par with the performance of direct modeling in the SparseTSF source domain as shown in Table~\\ref{main_reslut} and surpasses other baselines that model directly in the source domain. This robustly demonstrates the generalization capability of SparseTSF, indirectly proving the Sparse technique's ability to extract stable periodic features.\n\nTherefore, the SparseTSF model exhibits outstanding generalization capabilities. This characteristic is highly beneficial for the application of the SparseTSF model in scenarios involving small samples and low-quality data.\n\n\n\\section{Discussion}\n\n\n\\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}\n\\label{limits}\n\nThe SparseTSF model proposed in this paper excels in handling data with a stable main period, demonstrating enhanced feature extraction capabilities and an extremely lightweight architecture. However, there are two scenarios where SparseTSF may not be as effective:\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\textbf{Ultra-Long Periods}: In cases involving ultra-long periods (for example, periods exceeding 100), the Sparse technique results in overly sparse parameter connections. Consequently, SparseTSF does not perform optimally in such scenarios.\n\\item \\textbf{Multiple Periods}: SparseTSF may struggle with data that intertwines multiple periods, as the Sparse technique can only downsample and decompose one main period.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nFinally, one of our key future research directions is to further address the these potential limitations by designing additional modules to enhance SparseTSF's ability, thus achieving a balance between performance and parameter size.\n\\subsection{Differences Compared to Existing Methods}\nThe Sparse technique proposed in this paper involves downsampling/upsampling to achieve periodicity/trend decoupling. It may share a similar idea with existing methods, as downsampling/upsampling and periodic/trend decomposition techniques are prevalent in related literature nowadays.\n\n\\paragraph{SparseTSF Compared to N-HiTS}\nN-HiTS incorporates novel hierarchical interpolation and multi-rate data sampling techniques to achieve better results \\citep{Nhits}. The downsampling and upsampling techniques proposed in SparseTSF are indeed quite different from those used in N-HiTS, including:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item The downsampling and upsampling in SparseTSF occur before and after the model's prediction process, respectively, whereas N-HiTS conducts these operations within internally stacked modules.\n    \\item SparseTSF's downsampling involves resampling by a factor of \\(w\\) to \\(w\\) subsequences of length \\(L/w\\), which is technically equivalent to matrix reshaping and transposition, whereas N-HiTS employs downsampling through max-pooling.\n    \\item SparseTSF's upsampling involves transposing and reshaping the predicted subsequences back to the original sequence, whereas N-HiTS achieves upsampling through interpolation.\n\\end{itemize}\n\\paragraph{SparseTSF Compared to OneShotSTL}\nSeasonal-trend decomposition (STD) is a classical and powerful tool for time series forecasting, and OneShotSTL makes a great contribution to advancing the lightweight long-term forecasting process, featuring fast, lightweight, and powerful capabilities \\citep{OneShotSTL}. However, SparseTSF differs significantly from OneShotSTL in several aspects:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item SparseTSF is a neural network model while OneShotSTL is a non-neural network method focused on online forecasting.\n    \\item OneShotSTL minimizes residuals and calculates trend and seasonal subseries separately from the original sequence with lengths of \\(L\\), whereas our SparseTSF resamples the original sequence into \\(w\\) subseries of length \\(L/w\\) with a constant period \\(w\\).\n    \\item OneShotSTL accelerates inference by optimizing the original computation for online processing, while SparseTSF achieves lightweighting by using parameter-sharing linear layers for prediction across all subseries.\n\\end{itemize}\n \n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\n\\label{conclusion}\nIn this paper, we introduce the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique and the corresponding SparseTSF model. Through detailed theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrated the lightweight nature of the SparseTSF model and its capability to extract periodic features effectively. Achieving competitive or even surpassing the performance of current state-of-the-art models with a minimal parameter scale, SparseTSF emerges as a strong contender for deployment in computation resource-constrained environments. Additionally, SparseTSF exhibits potent generalization capabilities, opening new possibilities for applications in transferring to small samples and low-quality data scenarios. SparseTSF stands as another milestone in the journey towards lightweight models in the field of long-term time series forecasting. Finally, we aim to further tackle the challenges associated with extracting features from ultra-long-periodic and multi-periodic data in the future, striving to achieve an optimal balance between model performance and parameter size.\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n"

In this paper, we consider the task of learning in episodic RMAB with unknown transition functions and adversarial rewards, which can change arbitrarily across episodes. Further, we consider a challenging but natural bandit feedback setting that only adversarial rewards of activated arms are revealed to the decision maker (DM). The goal of the DM is to maximize its total adversarial rewards during the learning process while the instantaneous activation constraint must be satisfied in each decision epoch. We develop a novel reinforcement learning algorithm with two key contributors: a novel biased adversarial reward estimator to deal with bandit feedback and unknown transitions, and a low-complexity index policy to satisfy the instantaneous activation constraint.

                "abstract": "Restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) have been widely used to model sequential decision making problems with constraints. The decision maker (DM) aims to maximize the expected total reward over an infinite horizon under an “instantaneous activation constraint” that at most B arms can be activated at any decision epoch, where the state of each arm evolves stochastically according to a Markov decision process (MDP). However, this basic model fails to provide any fairness guarantee among arms. In this paper, we introduce RMAB-F, a new RMAB model with “long-term fairness constraints”, where the objective now is to maximize the longterm reward while a minimum long-term activation fraction for each arm must be satisfied. For the online RMAB-F setting (i.e., the underlying MDPs associated with each arm are unknown to the DM), we develop a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm named Fair-UCRL. We prove that Fair-UCRL ensures probabilistic sublinear bounds on both the reward regret and the fairness violation regret. Compared with off-the-shelf RL methods, our Fair-UCRL is much more computationally efficient since it contains a novel exploitation that leverages a low-complexity index policy for making decisions. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of our Fair-UCRL."

To overcome this difficulty, we propose a low-complexity fluid Whittle index policy, which jointly determines dimensioning and content caching. We show that this policy is asymptotically optimal. We further develop a lightweight reinforcement learning augmented algorithm dubbed fW-UCB when the content request and delivery rates are unavailable. fW-UCB is shown to achieve a sub-linear regret as it fully exploits the structure of the near-optimal fluid Whittle index policy and hence can be easily implemented. Extensive simulations using real traces support our theoretical results."

This is because it has been shown that adversarial transition functions make no-regret learning impossible. Despite such impossibility results, in this work, we develop algorithms that can handle both adversarial losses and adversarial transitions, with regret increasing smoothly in the degree of maliciousness of the adversary. More concretely, we first propose an algorithm that enjoys $\\widetilde{{O}}(\\sqrt{T} + C^{\\textsf{P}})$ regret where $C^{\\textsf{P}}$ measures how adversarial the transition functions are and can be at most ${O}(T)$. While this algorithm itself requires knowledge of $C^{\\textsf{P}}$, we further develop a black-box reduction approach that removes this requirement. Moreover, we also show that further refinements of the algorithm not only maintains the same regret bound, but also simultaneously adapts to easier environments (where losses are generated in a certain stochastically constrained manner as in Jin et al. [2021]) and achieves $\\widetilde{{O}}(U + \\sqrt{UC^{\\textsf{L}}} + C^{\\textsf{P}})$ regret, where $U$ is some standard gap-dependent coefficient and $C^{\\textsf{L}}$ is the amount of corruption on losses."

We propose the observe-then-decide regime and improve the existing decide-then-observe regime, while the two settings differ in how the observations and feedback about the reward and resource consumption functions are given to the decision-maker. We develop an online dual mirror descent algorithm that achieves near-optimal regret bounds for both settings.

Rewards and constraints can be selected either stochastically or adversarially, and the transition function is not known to the learner. While online learning in classical unconstrained MDPs has received considerable attention over the last years, the setting of CMDPs is still largely unexplored. This is surprising, since in real-world applications, such as, e.g., autonomous driving, automated bidding, and recommender systems, there are usually additional constraints and specifications that an agent has to obey during the learning process. In this paper, we provide the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for CMDPs with long-term constraints. Our algorithm is capable of handling settings in which rewards and constraints are selected either stochastically or adversarially, without requiring any knowledge of the underling process. Moreover, our algorithm matches state-of-the-art regret and constraint violation bounds for settings in which constraints are selected stochastically, while it is the first to provide guarantees in the case in which they are chosen adversarially."

The key challenge is to jointly optimize the video bitrate adaptation and resource allocation such that the users' cumulative quality of experience is maximized. This problem is a finite-horizon restless multi-armed multi-action bandit problem and is provably hard to solve. To overcome this challenge, we propose a computationally appealing index policy entitled Quality Index Policy, which is well-defined without the Whittle indexability condition and is provably asymptotically optimal without the global attractor condition. These two conditions are widely needed in the design of most existing index policies, which are difficult to establish in general. Since the wireless access edge network environment is highly dynamic with system parameters unknown and time-varying, we further develop an index-aware reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm dubbed QA-UCB. We show that QA-UCB achieves a sub-linear regret with a low-complexity since it fully exploits the structure of the Quality Index Policy for making decisions. Extensive simulations using real-world traces demonstrate significant gains of proposed policies over conventional approaches. We note that the proposed framework for designing index policy and index-aware RL algorithm is of independent interest and could be useful for other large-scale multi-user problems."

It is an extremely useful model for monitoring beneficiaries and executing timely interventions to ensure maximum benefit in public health settings (e.g., ensuring patients take medicines in tuberculosis settings, ensuring pregnant mothers listen to automated calls about good pregnancy practices). Due to the limited resources, typically certain communities or regions are starved of interventions that can have follow-on effects. To avoid starvation in the executed interventions across individuals/regions/communities, we first provide a soft fairness constraint and then provide an approach to enforce the soft fairness constraint in RMABs. The soft fairness constraint requires that an algorithm never probabilistically favor one arm over another if the long-term cumulative reward of choosing the latter arm is higher. Our approach incorporates softmax based value iteration method in the RMAB setting to design selection algorithms that manage to satisfy the proposed fairness constraint. Our method, referred to as SoftFair, also provides theoretical performance guarantees and is asymptotically optimal. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our approaches on simulated benchmarks and show that the soft fairness constraint can be handled without a significant sacrifice on value."

Due to its local-search nature, however, theoretical guarantees on global optimality often rely on extra assumptions on the Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that bypass the challenge of global exploration. To eliminate the need of such assumptions, in this work, we develop a general solution that adds dilated bonuses to the policy update to facilitate global exploration. To showcase the power and generality of this technique, we apply it to several episodic MDP settings with adversarial losses and bandit feedback, improving and generalizing the state-of-the-art. Specifically, in the tabular case, we obtain $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret where $T$ is the number of episodes, improving the $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}({T}^{2/3})$ regret bound by Shani et al.

We thus introduce ProbFair, a probabilistically fair policy that maximizes total expected reward and satisfies the budget constraint while ensuring a strictly positive lower bound on the probability of being pulled at each timestep. We evaluate our algorithm on a real-world application, where interventions support continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy adherence among patients, as well as on a broader class of synthetic transition matrices. We find that ProbFair preserves utility while providing fairness guarantees."

We consider both a fixed population of bandits as well as a dynamic population where bandits can depart and arrive. As an example of a dynamic population of bandits, we analyze a multi-class M/M/S+M queue for which we show asymptotic optimality of an index policy. \nWe combine fluid-scaling techniques with linear programming results to prove that when bandits are indexable, Whittle's index policy is included in our class of priority policies. We thereby generalize a result of Weber and Weiss (1990) about asymptotic optimality of Whittle's index policy to settings with (i) several classes of bandits, (ii) arrivals of new bandits, and (iii) multiple actions. \nIndexability of the bandits is not required for our results to hold.

The increasing volume of literature calls for better understanding of the characteristics of current spectrum utilization as well as better tools for analysis. A number of measurement studies have been conducted recently, revealing previously unknown features. On the other hand, analytical studies largely continues to rely on standard models like the two-state Markov (Gilbert-Elliot) model. In this paper, we present an alternative, stochastic differential equation (SDE) based spectrum utilization model that captures dynamic changes in channel conditions induced by primary users' activities. The SDE model is in closed form, can generate spectrum dynamics as a temporal process, and is shown to provides very good fit for real spectrum measurement data. We show how synthetic spectrum data can be generated in a straightforward manner using this model to enable realistic simulation studies. Moreover, we show that the SDE model can be viewed as a more general modeling framework (continuous in time and continuous in value) than commonly used discrete Markovian models: it is defined by only a few parameters but can be used to obtain the transition matrix of any N-state Markov model. This is verified by comparing the two-state GE model generated by the SDE model and that trained directly from the data. We show that the GE model is a good fit for the (quantized) data, thereby a fine choice when binary descriptions of the channel condition is sufficient. However, when highly resolution (in channel condition) is needed, the SDE model is much more accurate than an N-state model, and is much easier to train and store."

Such results are rather scarce in the literature since proving them requires a large deal of technical effort and significant modifications to the standard, more intuitive algorithms that come only with guarantees that hold on expectation. One of these modifications is forcing the learner to sample arms from the uniform distribution at least Ω( √T) times over T rounds, which can adversely affect performance if many of the arms are suboptimal. While it is widely conjectured that this property is essential for proving high-probability regret bounds, we show in this paper that it is possible to achieve such strong results without this undesirable exploration component. Our result relies on a simple and intuitive loss-estimation strategy called Implicit exploration (IX) that allows a remarkably clean analysis.

                "abstract": "We investigate a resource allocation problem in a multi-class server with convex holding costs and user impatience under the average cost criterion. In general, the optimal policy has a complex dependency on all the input parameters and state information. Our main contribution is to derive index policies that can serve as heuristics and are shown to give good performance. Our index policy attributes to each class an index, which depends on the number of customers currently present in that class. The index values are obtained by solving a relaxed version of the optimal stochastic control problem and combining results from restless multi-armed bandits and queueing theory. They can be expressed as a function of the steady-state distribution probabilities of a one-dimensional birth-and-death process. For linear holding cost, the index can be calculated in closed-form and turns out to be independent of the arrival rates and the number of customers present. In the case of no abandonments and linear holding cost, our index coincides with the cμ-rule, which is known to be optimal in this simple setting. For general convex holding cost we derive properties of the index value in limiting regimes: we consider the behavior of the index (i) as the number of customers in a class grows large, which allows us to derive the asymptotic structure of the index policies, and (ii) as the abandonment rate vanishes, which allows us to retrieve an index policy proposed for the multi-class M/M/1 queue with convex holding cost and no abandonments. In fact, in a multi-server environment it follows from recent advances that the index policy is asymptotically optimal for linear holding cost. To obtain further insights into the index policy, we consider the fluid version of the relaxed problem and derive a closed-form expression for the fluid index. The latter coincides with the stochastic model in case of linear holding costs. For arbitrary convex holding cost the fluid index can be seen as the Gcμθ-rule, that is, including abandonments into the generalized cμ-rule (Gcμ-rule). Numerical experiments show that our index policies become optimal as the load in the system increases."

In this problem, an agent has to traverse through a finite directed acyclic graph with random transitions while maximizing the obtained rewards along the way. We assume that the reward function can change arbitrarily between consecutive episodes, and is entirely revealed to the agent at the end of each episode. Previous work was concerned with the case when the stochastic dynamics is known ahead of time, whereas the main novelty of this paper is that this assumption is lifted. We propose an algorithm called “follow the perturbed optimistic policy” that combines ideas from the “follow the perturbed leader” method for online learning of arbitrary sequences and “upper confidence reinforcement learning”, an algorithm for regret minimization in Markovian decision processes (with a fixed reward function). We prove that the expected cumulative regret of our algorithm is of order L|X||A| p T up to logarithmic factors, where L is the length of the longest path in the graph,X is the state space, A is the action space and T is the number of episodes. To our knowledge this is the first algorithm that learns and controls stochastic and adversarial components in an online fashion at the same time."

Most especially we have in mind the allocation of a divisible resource (manpower, money, equipment) to a collection of objects (projects) requiring it in cases where its over-concentration would usually be far from optimal. The resulting project indices are functions of both a resource level and a state. They have a simple interpretation as a fair charge for increasing the resource available to the project from the specified resource level when in the specified state. We illustrate ideas by reference to two model classes which are of independent interest. In the first, a pool of servers is assigned dynamically to a collection of service teams, each of which mans a service station. We demonstrate indexability under a natural assumption that the service rate delivered is increasing and concave in the team size. The second model class is a generalization of the spinning plates model for the optimal deployment of a divisible investment resource to a collection of reward generating assets. Asset indexability is established under appropriately drawn laws of diminishing returns for resource deployment. For both model classes numerical studies provide evidence that the proposed greedy index heuristic performs strongly."

A timely response to this increased activity, Martin L. Puterman's new work provides a uniquely up-to-date, unified, and rigorous treatment of the theoretical, computational, and applied research on Markov decision process models. It discusses all major research directions in the field, highlights many significant applications of Markov decision processes models, and explores numerous important topics that have previously been neglected or given cursory coverage in the literature. Markov Decision Processes focuses primarily on infinite horizon discrete time models and models with discrete time spaces while also examining models with arbitrary state spaces, finite horizon models, and continuous-time discrete state models. The book is organized around optimality criteria, using a common framework centered on the optimality (Bellman) equation for presenting results. The results are presented in a \"theorem-proof\" format and elaborated on through both discussion and examples, including results that are not available in any other book. A two-state Markov decision process model, presented in Chapter 3, is analyzed repeatedly throughout the book and demonstrates many results and algorithms. Markov Decision Processes covers recent research advances in such areas as countable state space models with average reward criterion, constrained models, and models with risk sensitive optimality criteria. It also explores several topics that have received little or no attention in other books, including modified policy iteration, multichain models with average reward criterion, and sensitive optimality.

The projects are ‘restless' in that the state of a project evolves in time, whether or not it is allocated effort. The evolution of the state of each project follows a Markov rule, but transitions and rewards depend on whether or not the project receives effort. The objective is to maximize the expected time-average reward under a constraint that exactly m of the n projects receive effort at any one time. We show that as m and n tend to ∞ with m/n fixed, the per-project reward of the optimal policy is asymptotically the same as that achieved by a policy which operates under the relaxed constraint that an average of m projects be active. The relaxed constraint was considered by Whittle (1988) who described how to use a Lagrangian multiplier approach to assign indices to the projects. He conjectured that the policy of allocating effort to the m projects of greatest index is asymptotically optimal as m and n tend to∞. We show that the conjecture is true if the differential equation describing the fluid approximation to the index policy has a globally stable equilibrium point. This need not be the case, and we present an example for which the index policy is not asymptotically optimal. However, numerical work suggests that such counterexamples are extremely rare and that the size of the suboptimality which one might expect is minuscule."

Since ﬁnding the optimal control is typically intractable for restless bandits, existing learning algorithms are often computationally expensive or with a regret bound that is exponential in the number of arms and states. In this paper, we advocate index-aware reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to design RL algorithms operating on a much smaller dimensional subspace by exploiting the inherent structure in restless bandits. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst propose novel index policies to address dimensionality concerns, which are provably optimal. We then leverage the indices to develop two low-complexity index-aware RL algorithms, namely, (i) GM-R2MAB , which has access to a generative model; and (ii) UC-R2MAB , which learns the model using an upper conﬁdence style online exploitation method. We prove that both algorithms achieve a sub-linear regret that is only polynomial in the number of arms and states.

This renders them unable to capture critical complexities faced by planners in real domains, such as a system manager balancing maintenance, repair, and job scheduling, or a health worker deciding among treatments for a given patient. Limited previous work on Multi-action MARBs has only been specialized to sub-problems. Here we derive multiple algorithms for use on general Multi-action MARBs using Lagrangian relaxation techniques, leading to the following contributions: (i) We develop BLam, a bound optimization algorithm which leverages problem convexity to quickly and provably converge to the well-performing Lagrange policy; (ii) We develop SampleLam, a fast sampling technique for estimating the Lagrange policy, and derive a concentration bound to investigate its convergence properties; (iii) We derive best and worst case computational complexities for our algorithms as well as our main competitor; (iv) We provide experimental results comparing our algorithms to baselines on simulated distributions, including one motivated by a real-world community health intervention task. Our approach achieves significant, up to ten-fold speedups over more general methods without sacrificing performance and is widely applicable across general Multi-action MARBs.

                "\nRestless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) \\citep{whittle1988restless} has been widely used to study sequential decision making problems with an \\textit{``instantaneous activation constraint''} that at most $B$ out of $N$ arms can be activated at any decision epoch, ranging from wireless scheduling \\citep{sheng2014data,cohen2014restless,xiong2022index}, \nresource allocation \\citep{glazebrook2011general,larranaga2014index,xiong2023reinforcement,xiong2022whittle}, \nto healthcare \\citep{killian2021beyond}.  %Specifically, the decision maker (DM) can pull $B$ out of $N$ arms at each decision epoch. \nEach arm is described by a Markov decision process (MDP) \\citep{puterman1994markov}, and evolves stochastically according to two different transition kernels, depending on whether the arm is activated or not. Rewards are generated with each transition. The goal of the decision maker (DM) is to maximize the total expected reward over a finite-horizon \\citep{xiong2022AAAI} or an infinite-horizon \\citep{wang2020restless,avrachenkov2022whittle,xiong2022Neurips,xiong2023finite,wang2024online} under the instantaneous activation constraint. \nThe majority of the literature on RMAB consider a stochastic environment, where both the rewards and dynamics of the environments are assumed to be stationary over time. However, in real-world applications such as online advertising and revenue management, rewards\\footnote{Although most existing literature on adversarial learning use the term ``loss'' instead of ``reward'', we choose to use the latter, or more specifically ``adversarial reward''\nin this paper to be consistent with RMAB literature. One can translate between rewards and losses by taking negation.} are not necessarily stationary but can change arbitrarily between episodes \\citep{lee2023online}. To this end, we study the problem of learning \\textit{a finite-horizon adversarial RMAB (\\armab) with unknown transitions} over $T$ episodes. In each episode, all arms start from a fixed initial state, and the DM repeats the followings for a fixed number of $H$ decision epochs: determine whether or not to activate each arm while the instantaneous activation constraint must be satisfied, receive adversarial rewards from each arm, which transits to the next state according to some unknown transition functions. Specifically, we consider a challenging but natural \\textit{bandit feedback} setting, where the adversarial rewards in each decision epoch are only revealed to the DM when the state-action pairs are visited. The goal of the DM is to minimize its regret, which is the difference between its total adversarial rewards and the total rewards received by an optimal fixed policy. \n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison with existing works, where $T$ is the number of episodes and $H$ is the length of each episode. }\n\\scalebox{0.85}{\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nPaper & Model & Setting &Feedback & Constraint & Algorithm & Regret \\\\\\hline\n\\hline \\cite{rosenberg2019online}& MDP & Adversarial& {Full} & \\ding{55} & OMD & $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$\\\\ \n\\cite{rosenberg2019b} & MDP & Adversarial& {Bandi}t & \\ding{55}& OMD & $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^{2/3}T^{3/4})$\\\\\n\\cite{jin2020learning} & MDP &  Adversarial&{Bandit} & \\ding{55} & OMD & $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$ \\\\ \n\\cite{luo2021policy} & MDP & Adversarial& {Bandit} & \\ding{55} & Policy Optimization & $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^2\\sqrt{T})$\\\\\n\\hline\n\\cite{qiu2020upper} & CMDP & Adversarial&{Full} & {Average} & Primal-dual& $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$\\\\\n\\cite{germano2023best} & CMDP & Adversarial& {Full} & {Average} & Primal-dual& $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(HT^{3/4})$\\\\\n\\hline\n\\cite{wang2020restless} & RMAB & Stochastic&{Full} & Hard & Generative model& $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^{2/3}T^{2/3})$\\\\\n\\cite{xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips} & RMAB & Stochastic&{Full} & Hard & Index-based& $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{HT})$\\\\ \\hline\n\\textbf{This Work} & \\textbf{RMAB} & \\textbf{Adversarial}& \\textbf{Bandit} & \\textbf{Hard} & \\textbf{Index-based OMD}&${\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})}$\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\label{table:1}\n\\end{table*}\nTo achieve this goal, we develop an episodic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm named \\ucarmab. First, to handle unknown transitions of each arm, we construct confidence sets to guarantee the true ones lie in these sets with high probability (Section~\\ref{sec:confidence-set}). Second, to handle adversarial rewards, we apply Online Mirror Descent (OMD) to solve a relaxed problem, rather than directly on \\armab, in terms of occupancy measures (Section~\\ref{sec:OMD}). This is due to the fact that \\armab is known to be computationally intractable even in the offline setting \\citep{papadimitriou1994complexity}. We note that OMD has also been used in  adversarial MDP \\citep{rosenberg2019online, jin2020learning} and CMDP \\citep{qiu2020upper}. However, they considered a stationary occupancy measure due to the existing of stationary policies, which is not the case for our finite-horizon RMAB with instantaneous activation constraint. This requires us to leverage a time-dependent occupancy measure. \nThird, a key difference compared to stochastic RMAB \\citep{wang2020restless,xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips} is that with bandit feedback and to apply the above OMD, we must construct adversarial reward estimators since the rewards of arms are not completely revealed to the DM. We address this challenge by developing a novel biased overestimated reward estimator (Section~\\ref{sec:estimator}) based on the observations of counts for each state-action pairs.  Finally, to handle the instantaneous activation constraint in \\armab, we develop a low-complexity index policy (Section~\\ref{sec:index}) based on the solutions from the OMD in Section~\\ref{sec:OMD}. This is another key difference compared to adversarial MDP or CMDP, which requires us to explicitly characterize the regret due to the implementation of such an index policy.\nWe prove that \\ucarmab achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$ regret, where $T$ is the number of episodes and $H$ is the episode length. Although our regret bound exhibits a gap (i.e., $\\sqrt{H}$ times larger) to that of stochastic RMAB \\citep{xiong2022AAAI, xiong2022Neurips}, to our best knowledge, our result is the first to achieve $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for adversarial RMAB with bandit feedback and unknown transition functions, a harder problem compared to stochastic RMABs. \n \n\n\\textbf{Notations.}  We use calligraphy letter $\\mathcal{A}$ to denote a finite set with cardinality $|\\mathcal{A}|$, and $[N]$ to denote the set of integers $\\{1,\\cdots, N\\}$.\n\n\n"

Under a similar setting, a policy optimization method is developed in \\citet{luo2021policy} with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^2|\\cS|\\sqrt{|\\cA|T})$ regret. \nAnother line of recent works further consider the settings of linear function approximation \\citep{neu2021online}, the best-of-both-world \\citep{jin2021best}, delay bandit feedback \\citep{jin2022near} and adversarial transition functions \\citep{jin2023no}. \n\n\\textbf{Adversarial Constrained MDP (CMDP).} CMDP \\citep{altman1999constrained} plays an important role in control and planning, which aims to maximize a reward over all available policies subject to constraints that enforce the fairness or safety of the policies. \\citet{qiu2020upper} is one of the first to study CMDP with adversarial losses and unknown transition function. A primal-dual algorithm was proposed with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H|\\cS|\\sqrt{|\\cA|T})$ regret and constraint violation. \\citet{germano2023best} further considered both adversarial losses and constraints, and proposed a best-of-both-world algorithm, which achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(HT^{3/4})$ regret and constraint violation. \n\n\\textbf{RMAB.} RMAB was first introduced in \\citet{whittle1988restless}, and has been widely studied, see \\citet{nino2023markovian} and references therein. In particular, RL algorithms have been proposed for RMAB with unknown transitions. Colored-UCRL2 is the state-of-the-art method for {online RMAB with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{HT})$ regret. To address the exponential computational complexity of colored-UCRL2, low-complexity RL algorithms have been developed. For example, \\citet{wang2020restless} proposed a generative model-based algorithm with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^{2/3}T^{2/3})$ regret, and \\citet{xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips} designed index-aware RL algorithms for both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average reward settings with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{HT})$ regret\\footnote{For a fair comparison, the total time horizon for stochastic RMAB \\citep{wang2020restless,xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips} is set to be $HT$.}. However, most of the existing literature on RMAB focus on the stochastic setting, where the reward functions are stochastically sampled from a fixed distribution, either known or unknown. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to study RMAB in adversarial settings with unknown transition functions and bandit feedback. \n\n\n"

                "Model and Problem Formulation",
                "\nWe formally define the adversarial RMAB, and introduce the online settings considered in this paper.\n\n\\subsection{\\armab: Adversarial RMAB}\n\nConsider an episodic adversarial RMAB with $N$ arms. Each arm $n\\in[N]$ is associated with a  unichain MDP denoted by a tuple $(\\cS, \\cA, P_n, \\{r_n^t, \\forall t\\in[T]\\}, H)$. $\\cS$ is a finite state space, and $\\cA:=\\{0,1\\}$ is the set of binary actions. Using the standard terminology from RMAB literature, an arm is \\textit{passive} when action $a=0$ is applied to it, and \\textit{active} otherwise. $P_n:\\cS\\times\\cA\\times\\cS\\mapsto[0,1]$ is the transition kernel with $P_n(s^\\prime|s,a)$ being the probability of transition to state $s^\\prime$ from state $s$ by taking action $a$. $T$ is the number of episodes, each of which consists of $H$ decision epochs.  $r_n^t: \\cS\\times\\cA\\mapsto [0,1]$ is the adversarial reward function in episode $t$. For simplicity, let $r_n(s,0)=0, \\forall s\\in\\cS, n\\in[N]$.  We do not make any statistical assumption on the adversarial reward functions, \\textit{which can be chosen arbitrarily}\\footnote{\nHowever, in stochastic RMAB, rewards follow a stochastic distribution, which is fixed between episodes. This leads to a different objective in adversarial RMAB as the DM must adapt to dynamic and potentially hostile reward structures while striving to find an optimal policy across all episodes.}. \n\nAt decision epoch $h\\in[H]$ in episode $t\\in[T]$, an arm can be either active or passive. A policy determines what action to apply to each arm at $h$ under the instantaneous activation constraint that at most $B$ arms can be activated. Denote such a feasible policy in episode $t$ as $\\pi^t$, and let $\\{(S_n^{t,h}, A_n^{t,h})\\in\\cS\\times \\cA, \\forall t\\in[T], h\\in[H], n\\in[N]\\}$ be the random tuple generated according to transition functions $\\{P_n, \\forall n\\in[N]\\}$ and $\\pi^t$. \nThe corresponding expected reward in episode $t$ is \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:reward-ept}\n   R_t (\\pi^t)\\!:= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\sum_{n=1}^N \\!r_n^t(S_n^{t,h},A_n^{t,h})\\Big|\\{P_n, \\!\\forall n\\}, \\pi^t\\right].\n\\end{align}\nThe DM's goal is to find a policy $\\pi$ for all $T$ episodes which maximizes the total expected adversarial reward under the instantaneous active constraint, i.e., \n\\begin{align}\n\\armab: \\max_{\\pi}~ &R(T, \\pi):=\\sum_{t=1}^T  R_t(\\pi)\\allowdisplaybreaks\\nonumber\\\\ \n\\text{s.t.}~ & \\sum_{n=1}^N A_n^{t,h}\\leq B, \\forall h\\in [H] ,t\\in [T].\n    \\label{eq:orginal_P}\n\\end{align}\nIt is known that even when the transition kernel of each arm and the adversarial reward functions in each episode are revealed to the DM at the very beginning, {finding an optimal policy over $T$ episodes, denoted as $\\pi^{opt}$ for \\armab~(\\ref{eq:orginal_P})} is PSPACE-hard \\citep{papadimitriou1994complexity}. The fundamental challenge lies in the explosion of state space and the curse of dimensionality prevents computing optimal policies. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that transition kernels are often unknown in practice, and {adversarial reward functions are only revealed to the DM at the end of each episode in adversarial settings (see Section~\\ref{sec:online-setting}).} \n\\begin{remark}\nMost existing works on adversarial MDP \\citep{rosenberg2019online,rosenberg2019b, jin2020learning} and CMDP  \\citep{qiu2020upper, germano2023best} assume that the state space is loop-free. In other words, the state space $\\cS$ can be divided into $L$ distinct layers, i.e., $\\cS:=\\cS_1\\cup\\ldots\\cup\\cS_L$ with a singleton initial layer $\\cS_1=\\{s_1\\}$, a terminal layer $\\cS_L=\\{s_L\\}$, and $\\cS_\\ell \\cap \\cS_j=\\emptyset, j\\neq \\ell.$ Transitions only occur between consecutive layers, i.e., $P(s^\\prime|s,a)>0$ if $s^\\prime \\in \\cS_{\\ell+1}, s\\in\\cS_\\ell, \\forall \\ell\\in[L]$. \nOn one hand, many practical problems do not have a loop-free MDP. On the other hand, this assumption requires any non-loop-free MDP to extend its state space $L$ times to be transformed into a loop-free MDP with a fixed length $L$. This often enlarges the regret bound at least $L$ times. In this paper, we consider a general MDP  without such a restrictive loop-free assumption. \n\\end{remark}\n\n\\subsection{Online Setting and Learning Regret}\\label{sec:online-setting}\n\\begin{algorithm}[t]\n\t\\caption{{Online Interactions between the DM and the Adversarial RMAB Environment}}\n\t\\label{alg:importance-policy}\n\t\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\t\t\\REQUIRE State space $\\cS$, action space $\\cA$, and unknown transition functions $\\{\\cP_n, \\forall n\\}$;\n  \\FOR{$t=1$ to $T$}\n\\STATE {All arms start in state $S_n^{0}, \\forall n$;}\n\\STATE Adversary decides the reward function $\\{r_n^t, \\forall n\\}$, and the DM decides a policy $\\pi^t$; \n  \\FOR{$h=1$ to $H$}\n  \\STATE DM chooses actions $\\{A_{n}^{t,h}, \\forall n\\}$ under the instantaneous activation constraint; observes adversarial reward $\\{r_n^t(S_n^{t,h}, A_n^{t,h}),\\forall n\\}$; \\STATE Arm $n, \\forall n$ moves to the next state $S_n^{t,h+1}\\sim P_n(\\cdot|S_n^{t,h},A_n^{t,h})$ ;\n  \\STATE DM observes states $\\{S_n^{t,h+1}, \\forall n\\}$.\n  \\ENDFOR\n\t \\ENDFOR \n\t\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\nWe focus on the online adversarial settings where the underlying MDPs are unknown to the DM, and the adversarial reward is of bandit-feedback\\footnote{We use the term ``bandit-feedback'' as in \\citet{rosenberg2019b, jin2020learning} to denote that only the adversarial rewards of visited state-action pairs are revealed to the DM. }.\nThe interaction between the DM and the \\armab environment is presented in Algorithm~\\ref{alg:importance-policy}. Only the state and action spaces are known to the DM in advance, and the interaction proceeds in $T$ episodes. At the beginning of episode $t$, the adversary determines the adversarial reward functions, each arm $n$ starts from a fixed state $S_n^0, \\forall n\\in[N]$, and the DM determines a policy $\\pi^t$ and then executes this policy for each decision epoch $h\\in[H]$ in this episode. Specifically, at decision epoch $h$, the DM chooses actions $\\{A_{n}^{t,h}, \\forall n\\in \\cN\\}$ for each arm according to $\\pi^t(\\cdot|S_n^{t,h})$ under the instantaneous activation constraint, i.e., $\\sum_{n=1}^N A_{n}^{t,h}=B$, and each arm then moves to the next state $S_n^{t,h+1}$ sampled from $P_n(\\cdot|S_n^{t,h},A_n^{t,h})$. The DM records the trajectory of the current episode $t$ and the adversarial rewards in each decision epoch are \\textit{only revealed to the DM when the state-action pairs are visited due to bandit-feedback.} \n \n\nThe DM's goal is to minimize its regret, as defined by\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:regret}\n    \\Delta(T):=R(T, \\pi^{opt})-\\sum_{t=1}^T R_t(\\pi^t), \n\\end{align}\nwhere $R(T, \\pi^{opt})$ is the total expected adversarial rewards under the offline optimal policy $\\pi^{opt}$ by solving~(\\ref{eq:orginal_P}), and $R_t(\\pi^t)$ is defined in~(\\ref{eq:reward-ept}). We simply refer to \\armab as in the online setting in the rest of this paper. \nAlthough the above definition is similar to that in stochastic settings, the fundamental difference is that the offline policy $\\pi^{opt}$ is only optimal when it is defined over all $T$ episodes, and it is not guaranteed to be optimal in each episode, which is the case for stochastic setting. This is because the adversarial rewards can change arbitrarily between episodes rather than following some fixed (unknown) distribution as in the stochastic setting. This fundamental difference will necessitate new techniques in terms of regret characterization, which we will discuss in details in Section~\\ref{sec:analysis}. \n\n"

                "\nWe show that it is possible to design a RL algorithm to solve the regret minimization problem \\eqref{eq:regret} for the computationally intractable \\armab. Specifically, we leverage the popular UCRL-based algorithm to the online adversarial RMAB setting, and\ndevelop an episodic RL algorithm named \\ucarmab.  There are four key components of our algorithm: (1) maintaining a confidence set of the transition functions; (2) using online mirror descent (OMD) to solve a relaxed version of \\armab in terms of occupancy measure to deal with adversarial rewards; (3) constructing an adversarial reward estimator to deal with bandit feedback;  and (4) designing a low-complexity index policy to ensure that the instantaneous activation constraint is satisfied in each decision epoch.  We summarize our \\ucarmab in Algorithm \\ref{alg:UCB}, which operates in an episodic manner with a total of $T$ episodes and each episode including $H$ decision epochs. For simplicity, let $\\tau_t:= H(t-1)+1$ be the starting time of the $t$-th episode. \n\\begin{algorithm}[t]\n\t\\caption{\\ucarmab}\n\t\\label{alg:UCB}\n\t\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n     \\REQUIRE  Initialize $C_n^{1}(s,a)=0,$  $\\hat{P}_n^{1}(s^\\prime|s,a)=1/|\\cS|$\t\n\t\t\\FOR{$t=1,2,\\cdots,T$}\n\t \\STATE Construct $\\cP_n^{t}(s,a)$   according to \\eqref{eq:confidence_ball} at $\\tau_t$; \t\t\n  \\STATE Construct the adversarial reward estimator $\\hat{r}_n^t(s,a), \\forall s, a, n$ according to \\eqref{eq:reward_estimator};\n  \\STATE Obtain a relaxed \\armab \\eqref{eq:relaxed_constraint} in terms of occupancy measure, and solve \\eqref{eq:UCB_extended} with OMD; \n  \\STATE Construct an index policy $\\pi^{t}$ according to~(\\ref{eq:importance-index}). \n\t\t\\ENDFOR\n\t\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\n\\subsection{Confidence Sets}\\label{sec:confidence-set}\n\nAs discussed in Section~\\ref{sec:model}, \\armab has two components: a stochastic transition function, and an adversarial reward function for each arm. Since transition functions are unknown to the DM, we maintain confidence sets via past sample trajectories, which contain true transition functions $P_n, \\forall n$ with high probability. Specifically, \\ucarmab maintains two counts for each arm $n$.  Let $C_n^{t-1}(s,a), \\forall n\\in[N]$ be the number of visits to state-action pairs $(s,a)$ until $\\tau_t$, and $C_n^{t-1}(s,a, s^\\prime), \\forall n\\in[N]$ be the number of transitions from $s$ to $s^\\prime$ under action $a$. At episode $t$, \\ucarmab updates these two counts as: $\\forall (s,a,s^\\prime)\\in\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{S}$\n\\begin{align*}\n    C_n^{t}(s,a)&=C_n^{t-1}(s,a)+\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\mathds{1}(S_n^{t,h}=s,A_n^{t,h}=a),\\displaybreak[0]\\\\\n    C_n^{t}(s,a, s^\\prime)&=C_n^{t-1}(s,a, s^\\prime)\\displaybreak[1]\\\\\n    &+\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\mathds{1}(S_n^{t,h+1}=s^\\prime|S_n^{t,h}=s,A_n^{t,h}=a).\n\\end{align*}\n\\ucarmab estimates the true transition function by the corresponding empirical average as:\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:empirical_est_P}\n\\hat{P}_n^{t}(s^\\prime|s,a)=\\frac{C_n^{t-1}(s,a,s^\\prime)}{\\max\\{C_n^{t-1}(s,a),1\\}},\n\\end{align}\nand then defines confidence sets at episode $t$ as \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:confidence_ball} \n \\cP_n^{t}(s,a)&:=\\{\\tilde{P}_n^t(s^\\prime|s,a),\\forall s^\\prime:\\nonumber\\\\\n &\\quad\\quad|\\tilde{P}_n^t(s^\\prime|s,\\!a)\\!-\\!\\hat{P}_n^{t}(s^\\prime|s,\\!a)|\\!\\leq\\! \\delta_n^{t}(s,\\!a)\\},\n\\end{align}\nwhere the confidence width $\\delta_n^{t}(s,a)$ is built according to the Hoeffding inequality \\citep{maurer2009empirical} as: for $\\epsilon\\in(0,1)$ \n\\begin{align}\n\\delta_n^{t}(s,a)\\!=\\!\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2C_n^{t-1}(s,a)}\\!\\log\\!\\Big(\\frac{4|\\cS||\\cA|N(t\\!-\\!1)H}{\\epsilon}\\Big)}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nWith probability at least $1-2\\epsilon$, the true transition functions are within the confidence sets, i.e., $P_n\\in \\cP_n^{t}$, $\\forall n\\in[N], t\\in[T].$\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\n\\subsection{Solving Relaxed \\armab with OMD}\\label{sec:OMD}\nRecall that solving \\armab is computationally expensive even in the offline setting \\citep{papadimitriou1994complexity}. To tackle this challenge, we first relax the instantaneous activation constraint, i.e., the activation constraint is satisfied on average, and obtain the following relaxed problem of \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:relaxed_constraint}\n\\max_{\\pi}~ &R(T, \\pi):=\\sum_{t=1}^T  R_t(\\pi)\\displaybreak[0]\\nonumber\\\\ \n   \\text{s.t.}~ & \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[\\sum_{n=1}^N A_n^{t,h}\\right]\\leq B, ~h\\in[H], t\\in[T]. \n\\end{align}\nIt turns out that this relaxed \\armab can be equivalently transformed into a linear programming (LP) using occupancy measure \\citep{altman1999constrained}. \nMore specifically, the occupancy measure $\\mu$ of a policy $\\pi$ for a finite-horizon MDP is defined as the expected number of visits to a state-action pair $(s, a)$ at each decision epoch $h$.  Formally,\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:OM}\n\\mu^\\pi=& \\Big\\{\\mu_n(s,a;h)=\\mathbb{P}(S_n^h=s, A_n^h=a)\\nonumber\\\\\n&\\qquad: \\forall n\\in[N], s\\in\\cS, a\\in\\cA, h\\in[H] \\Big\\}.\n\\end{align}\nIt can be easily checked that occupancy measures satisfy the following two properties. First, \n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{s\\in\\cS}\\sum_{a\\in\\cA}\\mu_n(s,a;h)=1, \\forall n\\in[N], h\\in[H],\n\\end{align}\nwith $0\\leq \\mu_n(s,a;h)\\leq 1$.  Hence the occupancy measure $\\mu_n$, $\\forall n$ is a probability measure. Second, the fluid balance exists in occupancy measure transitions as\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\!\\!\\mu_n(s,a;h)\\!=\\!\\!\\sum_{s^\\prime}\\!\\sum_{ a^\\prime}\\!\\mu_n(s^\\prime,\\!a^\\prime; h\\!-\\!1)P_n(s^\\prime,\\!a^\\prime,\\!s).\n\\end{align}\nFor ease of presentation, we relegate the details of the equivalent LP of~(\\ref{eq:relaxed_constraint}) to the supplementary materials.\n\n\\begin{remark}\\label{remark:OM}\nOccupancy measure has been widely used in adversarial MDP \\cite{rosenberg2019online, jin2020learning} and CMDP \\cite{qiu2020upper}. Since there exists a stationary policy in these settings, the regret minimization problem in \\citet{rosenberg2019online, jin2020learning, qiu2020upper} can be equivalently reduced to an online linear optimization in terms of the stationary occupancy measure. Unlike these works, there is no such stationary policy for our considered finite-horizon RMAB with the instantaneous activation constraint, and hence we cannot reduce our regret~(\\ref{eq:regret}) into a linear optimization using stationary occupancy measure. To address this additional challenge, we leverage the time-dependent occupancy measure~(\\ref{eq:OM}), and the regret minimization calls for different proof techniques (see Section~\\ref{sec:analysis} for details). \n\\end{remark}\n \nUnfortunately, we cannot solve this LP since we have no knowledge about the true transition functions and adversarial rewards. Similar to the stochastic setting \\cite{xiong2022AAAI, xiong2022Neurips} and with the confidence sets defined in Section~\\ref{sec:confidence-set}, we can further rewrite this LP as an extended LP by leveraging the \\textit{state-action-state occupancy measure} $z_n^t(s, a, s^\\prime; h)$ defined as $z_n^t(s, a, s^\\prime; h)=P_n(s^\\prime|s,a)\\mu_n^t(s,a;h)$ to express the confidence intervals of the transition probabilities. Unlike \\citet{xiong2022AAAI, xiong2022Neurips}, the adversarial rewards can change arbitrarily between episodes, and hence we also need to guarantee that the updated occupancy measure in episode $t$ does not deviate too much away from the previously chosen occupancy measure in episode $t-1$. Thus, we further incorporate $D(z^t||z^{t-1})$ into the objective function, which is the unnormalized Kullback-Leible (KL) divergence between two occupancy measures, which is defined as\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:KL_divergence}\n\\hspace{-0.3cm}D(z^t||z^{t-1})&:=\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\sum_{s,a,s^\\prime}z^t(s,a,s^\\prime;h)\\ln\\frac{z^t(s,a,s^\\prime;h)}{z^{t-1}(s,a,s^\\prime;h)}\\nonumber\\\\\n&\\qquad-z^t(s,a,s^\\prime;h)+z^{t-1}(s,a,s^\\prime;h).\n\\end{align}\nThe DM needs to solve a non-linear problem over $z^t:=\\{z_n^t(s, a, s^\\prime; h), \\forall n\\in[N]\\}$ for a given parameter $\\eta>0$:  \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:UCB_extended}\n\\max_{z^t}&\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\!\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\!\\sum_{(s,a,s^\\prime)}\\!\\!\\! \\eta z_n^t(s,a, s^\\prime;h)\\hat{r}_n^{t-1}(s,a)\\!-\\!D(z^t||z^{t-1})\\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\\n\\mbox{ s.t.} &\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\sum_{(s,a,s^\\prime)} az_n^t(s,a,s^\\prime; h) \\le B ,\\quad~\\forall h\\in[H], \\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\\n&{\\sum_{a, s^\\prime}} z_n^t(s,a,s^\\prime;h)\\!=\\!\\!\\!\\sum_{s^\\prime, a^\\prime}\\!z_n^t(s^\\prime, a^\\prime, s; h-1),\\forall h\\!\\in\\![H],  \\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\ \n&~\\frac{z_n^t(s,a,s^\\prime;h)}{\\sum_y z_n^t(s,a,y;h)}-(\\hat{P}_n^t(s^\\prime|s,a)+\\delta_n^t(s,a))\\leq 0, \\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\ \n&-\\frac{z_n^t(s,a,s^\\prime;h)}{\\sum_y z_n^t(s,a,y;h)}\\!+\\!(\\hat{P}_n^t(s^\\prime|s,a)\\!-\\!\\delta_n^t(s,a))\\!\\leq\\! 0, \\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\ \n& z_n^t(s,a, s^\\prime;h)\\!\\geq\\! 0,  \\forall s,s^\\prime\\!\\in\\mathcal{S}, a\\!\\in\\!\\mathcal{A},\\forall n\\!\\in\\![N], \n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\hat{r}_n^{t-1}(s,a)$ is the estimated adversarial reward due to bandit feedback, and we formally define it in Section~\\ref{sec:estimator}. \n\nThis problem has $O(|\\mathcal{S}|^2|\\mathcal{A}|HN)$ constraints and decision variables. Inspired by \\citet{rosenberg2019online}, we solve~(\\ref{eq:UCB_extended}) via OMD to choose the occupancy measure for each episode $t$. We first solve a unconstrained problem by setting $\\tilde{z}^{t}(s,a,s^\\prime; h)=z^{t-1}(s,a,s^\\prime;h)e^{\\eta \\hat{r}^{t-1}(s,a)}$. Then we project the unconstrained maximizer $\\tilde{z}^{t}$ into the feasible set $\\cZ^t$, which is defined by the constraints in \\eqref{eq:UCB_extended}. This can be reduced to a convex optimization problem, and can be efficiently solved using iterative methods \\citep{boyd2004convex}. For ease of readability, we relegate the details of solving \\eqref{eq:UCB_extended} to the supplementary materials.  Denote the optimal solution to~(\\ref{eq:UCB_extended}) as $z^{t,\\star}$. \n\n\n\\subsection{Adversarial Reward Estimators}\\label{sec:estimator} \nSince we consider a challenging bandit feedback setting, where the adversarial rewards in each decision epoch are revealed to the DM only when the state-action pairs are visited, we need to construct adversarial reward estimators based on observations. Specifically, we build upon the inverse importance-weighted estimators based on the observation of counts for each state-action pairs. Given the trajectory for episode $t$, a straightforward estimator is \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:unbias}\n\\frac{r_n(s,a)}{\\max\\{c_n^t(s,a),1\\}/H}\\mathds{1}(\\exists h, S_n^{t,h}=s, A_n^{t,h}=a), \n\\end{align}\nwhere $c_n^t(s,a):=\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\mathds{1}(S_n^{t,h}=s,A_n^{t,h}=a)$ is the number of visits to state-action pair $(s,a)$ in episode $t$. For simplicity, we denote $\\bar{r}_n^{t}(s,a):=\\frac{r_n(s,a)}{\\max\\{c_n^t(s,a),1\\}/H}$. Clearly, $\\bar{r}_n^{t}(s,a)\\mathds{1}(\\exists h, S_n^{t,h}=s, A_n^{t,h}=a)$ is an unbiased estimator of ${r}_n^{t}(s,a)$ from the above definition. A key difference between the unbiased estimator in \\eqref{eq:unbias} and those in previous works on adversarial MDPs  \\citep{jin2020learning, rosenberg2019online} lies in the construction of the denominator in \\eqref{eq:unbias}. Specifically, \\citet{jin2020learning, rosenberg2019online} considered MDPs with a underlying stationary policy, and hence the evolution of the dynamics in the considered MDPs will converge to this stationary policy. This enables the construction of the denominator in the estimator using the occupancy measure for each for each state-action pair under such a policy. In contrast, it is known that the dynamics in RMAB cannot converge to the stationary policy due to the fact that RMABs implement an index policy (see Section~\\ref{sec:index}) to deal with the instantaneous activation constraint, and it is only provably in the asymptotic regime \\cite{weber1990index,verloop2016asymptotically}. This render the approaches in  \\citet{jin2020learning, rosenberg2019online} not applicable to ours, and necessitates different methods to construct the estimator as in \\eqref{eq:unbias}. \n\n\nSince we consider the bandit feedback, we further leverage the idea of implicit exploration as inspired by \\citet{neu2015explore,jin2020learning} to further encourage exploration. Specifically, we further increase $\\bar{r}_n^{t}(s,a)$ with a bonus term $\\delta_n^t(s,a)$ to obtain a biased estimator $(\\bar{r}_n^{t}(s,a)+\\delta_n^t(s,a))\\mathds{1}(\\exists h, S_n^{t,h}=s, A_n^{t,h}=a)$. Since $r_n^t(s,a)\\in[0,1]$ and to guarantee that this biased estimator is an overestimate, we further add the term $1-\\mathds{1}(\\exists h, S_n^{t,h}=s, A_n^{t,h}=a)$. Thus, our final adversarial reward estimator is $\\hat{r}_n^{t}(s,a)$\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:reward_estimator}\n    =&\\min\\Big((\\bar{r}_n^{t}(s,a)+\\delta_n^t(s,a)) \\mathds{1}(\\exists h, S_n^{t,h}=s, A_n^{t,h}=a), 1\\Big) \\nonumber\\\\\n    &\\qquad\\qquad+ 1-\\mathds{1}(\\exists h, S_n^{t,h}=s, A_n^{t,h}=a).\n\\end{align}\nGiven the above constructions, it is clear that $\\hat{r}_n^{t}(s,a)$ is a biased estimator upper-bounded by $1$ and is overestimating  $r_n^t(s,a), \\forall s, a, n, t$ with high probability. Using overestimates for adversarial learning with bandit feedback can be viewed as an optimism principle to encourage exploration. This is beneficial for the regret characterization as the deterministic overestimation as in \\citet{jin2020learning} to guarantee a tighter regret bound.\n\n\\begin{remark}\nThe reward estimator in stochastic RMAB \\citep{xiong2022AAAI, xiong2022Neurips} is simply defined as the sample mean using all trajectories up to episode $t$, which cannot be applied to our adversarial RMAB. This is due to the fact that the rewards are assumed to be drawn from an unknown but fixed distribution across all episodes for stochastic RMAB, while rewards can change arbitrarily between episodes for adversarial RMAB. The bandit-feedback setting further differentiates our adversarial RMAB from classical stochastic ones. Finally, we note that \\citet{jin2020learning} considered the bandit feedback for adversarial MDP, and also constructed an adversarial loss/reward estimator. Since the regret minimization problem in \\citet{jin2020learning} can be reduced to an online linear optimization using stationary occupancy measure (see Remark~\\ref{remark:OM}), the estimator can be constructed directly using the stationary occupancy measure.  Since there is no such stationary policy for our finite-horizon adversarial RMAB, this makes the estimator in \\citet{jin2020learning} not directly applicable to ours, and necessitates different construction techniques as discussed above. \n\\end{remark}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{Adversarial_RMAB_flow.pdf}\n    \\caption{The workflow of \\ucarmab and its regret analysis.

Inspired by \\citet{xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips}, we further construct an index policy on top of $z^{t,\\star}$ that is feasible for \\armab. Specifically, since $\\cA:=\\{0,1\\}$, i.e., an arm can be either active or passive at each decision epoch $h$, we define the index assigned to arm $n$ in state $S_n^{t, h}=s$ at decision epoch $h$ of episode $t$ to be as \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:importance-index}\n\\mathcal{I}_n^t(s;h):=\\frac{\\sum_{s^\\prime}z_n^{t,\\star}(s,1,s^\\prime;h)}{\\sum_{b,s^\\prime}z_n^{t,\\star}(s,b,s^\\prime;h)},\\quad \\forall n\\in[N].\n\\end{align}\nWe call this the reward-maximizing index (RMI) since $\\mathcal{I}_n^t(s;h)$ indicates the probability of activating arm $n$ in state $s$ at decision epoch $h$ of episode $t$ towards maximizing the total expected adversarial rewards. To this end, we rank all arms according to their indices in a non-increasing order, and activate the set of $B$ highest indexed arms at each decision epoch $h$. All remaining arms are kept passive at decision epoch $h$. We denote the resultant RMI policy as $\\pi^{t}:=\\{\\pi_{n}^{t}, \\forall n\\}$, and execute it in episode $t$.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:asympt_opt}\nThe RMI policy is asymptotically optimal when both the number of arms and instantaneous activation constraint are enlarged by $\\rho$ times with $\\rho\\rightarrow\\infty$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\n\n"

The first term is the regret due to the OMD online optimization for occupancy measure updates (Section~\\ref{sec:OMD}). The second term represents the regret due to bandit-feedback of adversarial rewards (Section~\\ref{sec:estimator}). The third term comes from the implementation of our RMI policy for \\armab (to satisfy the instantaneous activation constraint,  Section~\\ref{sec:index}). Clearly, the regret of \\ucarmab is in the order of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$. This is the same as that for adversarial MDP \\citep{rosenberg2019online, jin2020learning} and CMDP \\citep{qiu2020upper}. However, none of them consider an instantaneous activation constraint as in our \\armab, which requires us to design a low-complexity index policy, and explicitly characterize its impact on the regret.  Although our regret bound exhibits a gap (i.e., $\\sqrt{H}$ times larger) to that of stochastic RMAB \\citep{xiong2022AAAI, xiong2022Neurips}, to the best of our knowledge, our result is the first to achieve $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Recall that comparing to the stochastic RMAB, we are considering a harder problem with a challenging setting, i.e., the rewards can change arbitrarily between episodes rather than following a fixed distribution, and with bandit feedback where only the adversarial reward of visited state-action pairs are revealed to the DM. This challenging setting thus requires us to design a novel adversarial reward estimator coupled with the OMD online optimization procedure. \n\\subsection{Proof Sketch}\nAs discussed earlier, \\armab~(\\ref{eq:orginal_P}) is computationally intractable, and hence we cannot directly solve it and transform the regret minimization in~(\\ref{eq:regret}) into an online linear optimization problem. This makes existing regret analysis for adversarial MDP  \\citep{rosenberg2019online, jin2020learning} and CMDP \\citep{qiu2020upper} not directly applicable to ours, and necessitates different proof techniques.  To address this challenge and inspired by stochastic RMAB \\citep{xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips}, we instead work on the relaxed problem~(\\ref{eq:relaxed_constraint}), which achieves a provably upper bound on the adversarial rewards of \\armab~(\\ref{eq:orginal_P}).  In other words, the occupancy measure-based solutions to~(\\ref{eq:relaxed_constraint}) provide an upper bound of the optimal adversarial reward $R( T, \\pi^{opt})$ achieved by the offline optimal policy $\\pi^{opt}$ of \\armab \\eqref{eq:orginal_P}. We state this result formally in the following lemma. \n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:upperbound}\nThere exists a set of occupancy measures $\\mu_{\\pi}^*:=\\{\\mu^*_n(s,a;h), \\forall n\\in[N], s\\in\\cS, a\\in\\cA, h\\in[h]\\}$ under policy $\\pi^*$  that optimally solve the equivalent LP of the relaxed problem~(\\ref{eq:relaxed_constraint}). In addition, $\\sum_{t=1}^T \\langle{\\mu_\\pi^*}, r^t\\rangle$ is no less than $R( T, \\pi^{opt})$, where $r^t:=\\{r_n^t(s,a), \\forall n, s, a\\}$. \n\\end{lemma}\n\nThe proof of Theorem~\\ref{thm:regret} then starts with a regret decomposition. Unlike stochastic RMAB \\citep{xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips}, we cannot simply decompose the regret over episodes. This is because in our \\armab, the adversarial rewards can change arbitrarily between episodes, and the offline optimal policy $\\pi^{opt}$ is only optimal when it is defined over all $T$ episodes and it is not guaranteed to be optimal in each episode (see Section~\\ref{sec:model}). As a result, the regret analysis for stochastic RMAB \\citep{xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips} is not applicable to ours. To address this challenge, we instead decompose the regret in terms of its coming sources.  Specifically, we first need to characterize the regret due to solving the relaxed problem with OMD in terms of occupancy measure (Section~\\ref{sec:OMD}). We then bound the regret due to the biased overestimated reward estimator (Section~\\ref{sec:estimator}). Finally, we bound the regret of implementing our RMI policy (Section~\\ref{sec:index}). We visualize these three steps in Figure \\ref{fig:Flowchart} and provide a proof sketch herein. Combining them together gives rise to our main theoretical results in Theorem~\\ref{thm:regret}.  \n\n\n\\textbf{Regret decomposition.} We formally state our regret decomposition in the following lemma.  \n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lemma:regret_decomp}\n{Denote $\\pi^{*}$ as the optimal policy  to equivalent LP of the relaxed problem~(\\ref{eq:relaxed_constraint}) and $\\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}$ are polices executed on the MDPs at each episode with transition kernels selected from the confidence set defined in \\eqref{eq:confidence_ball}.}\nLet $R(T, \\pi^{*}, \\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\})$ be the total adversarial rewards achieved by policy $\\pi^*$ with overestimated rewards $\\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\}$. Denote \n$R(T, \\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}, \\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\})$ and  $R( T, \\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}, \\{r_n^t, \\forall n, t\\})$ as the total adversarial rewards achieved by policy $\\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}$ with overestimated rewards $\\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\}$ and true reward $\\{{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\}$, respectively.\nThe regret in \\eqref{eq:regret} can be upper bounded as\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:lemma2}\n    &\\Delta(T)\\!\\leq {\\underset{Term_0\\leq 0}{\\underbrace{R(T, \\pi^{opt})-R( T, \\pi^{*}, \\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\}), \\forall n, t\\})}}}\\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\\n    &+\\underset{Term_1}{\\underbrace{R( T, \\pi^{*}, \\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\})\\!-\\!R( T, \\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}, \\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\})}}\\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\\n    &+\\!\\underset{Term_2}{\\underbrace{R( T, \\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}, \\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n,t\\})\\!-\\!R( T, \\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}, \\{{r}_n^t, \\forall n,t\\})}}\\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\\n    &+\\underset{Term_3}{\\underbrace{R( T, \\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}, \\{{r}_n^t, \\forall n,t\\})-\\sum_{t=1}^T R_t(\\pi^t)}}. \\allowdisplaybreaks\n\\end{align}\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\n Specifically, $Term_0\\leq 0$ holds  due to Lemma \\ref{lem:upperbound} and the overestimation of adversarial rewards.  $Term_1$ is the performance gap between the optimal policy $\\pi^*$ of the relaxed problem~\\eqref{eq:relaxed_constraint} and the OMD updated policy $\\{\\tilde{\\pi}^{t}, \\forall t\\}$ under the plausible MDP selected from the confidence set in \\eqref{eq:confidence_ball}. Since we leverage the OMD to update the occupancy measures, to bound $Term_1$, the key is to connect items in $Term_1$ with the occupancy measure, which leverages the result in Lemma \\ref{lem:upperbound}. $Term_2$ is the regret due to the overestimation of the adversarial reward estimator, i.e., $\\hat{r}_n^t\\geq r_n^t, \\forall n, t$.  $Term_3$ is the performance gap between the policy $\\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}$ in the optimistic plausible MDP and the learned RMI index policy $\\{\\pi^t, \\forall t\\}$ for the true MDP. We bound it based on the count of visits of each state-action pair. \n\n\\textbf{Bounding $Term_1$.} We first bound $Term_1$, i.e., the regret due to OMD online optimization.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:term1}\nWith probability $1-2\\epsilon$, \nwe have $Term_1\\leq \\frac{NH\\ln(|\\cS|^2|\\cA|)}{\\eta}+\\eta{NH(T+1)}.$\n\\end{lemma}\n\nBounding $Term_1$ is equivalent to bound the inner product $\\sum_{t=1}^T\\sum_{n=1}^N\\langle \\mu_n^* - z_n^t, \\hat{r}_n^t \\rangle$, with $z_n^t, \\forall n \\in[N]$ being controlled by the OMD updates, a proper $\\eta$ (as given in Theorem~\\ref{thm:regret}) is required to guarantee $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$ regret. \n\\textbf{Bounding $Term_2$.} We then bound $Term_2$, i.e., the regret due to bandit-feedback adversarial reward.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:term2}\nWith probability $1-3\\epsilon$, we have $Term_2\\leq H\\sqrt{2NT\\ln\\frac{4|\\cS||\\cA|NT}{\\epsilon}}+HN\\sqrt{NT\\ln \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}}.$\nBounding $Term_2$ requires us to bound the inner product\n$\\sum_{t=1}^T\\sum_{n=1}^N\\langle  z_n^t, \\hat{r}_n^t-r_n^t \\rangle$, which is dominated by the gap of $\\hat{r}_n^t-r_n^t$. An overestimation can guarantee that $\\langle  z_n^t, \\hat{r}_n^t-r_n^t \\rangle\\geq 0, \\forall n\\in[N], t\\in[T].$\n\\textbf{Bounding $Term_3$.} Finally, we bound $Term_3$, i.e., the regret due to RMI index policy. \n \n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:term3}\nWith probability $1-2\\epsilon$,  we have $Term_3\\leq\\Big(\\sqrt{2\\ln\\frac{4|\\cS||\\cA|NTH}{\\epsilon}}+2B\\Big)\\sqrt{|\\cS||\\cA|NTH}.$\nSince the adversarial rewards (i.e., $\\hat{r}_n^t$) do not impact $Term_3$, we decompose  $Term_3$ into each episode.  The key  is to characterize the number of visits of each state-action pair, which is related to the instantaneous activation constraint $B$ and has a $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(B\\sqrt{TH})$ regret.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{minipage}{.24\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{AdversarialReward.pdf}\n\\subcaption{Accumulated Reward.}\n \\label{fig:reward}\n\\end{minipage}\\hfill\n\\begin{minipage}{.24\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{AdversarialRegret.pdf}\n\\subcaption{Accumulated Regret.}\n \\label{fig:regret}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{The learning performance comparison for case study-CPAP.}\n        \\label{fig:examples}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{minipage}{.24\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{Casestudy_reward.pdf}\n\\subcaption{Accumulated reward.}\n \\label{fig:reward2}\n\\end{minipage}\\hfill\n\\begin{minipage}{.24\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{Casestudy_regret.pdf}\n\\subcaption{Accumulated regret.}\n \\label{fig:regret2}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{The learning performance comparison for case study-A Deadline Scheduling Problem.}\n        \\label{fig:examples2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n"

However, SOTA Whittle-index-based approaches to this planning problem either do not consider fairness among arms, or incentivize fairness without guaranteeing it. We thus introduce ProbFair, a probabilistically fair policy that maximizes total expected reward and satisfies the budget constraint while ensuring a strictly positive lower bound on the probability of being pulled at each timestep. We evaluate our algorithm on a real-world application, where interventions support continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy adherence among patients, as well as on a broader class of synthetic transition matrices. We find that ProbFair preserves utility while providing fairness guarantees.\n@inproceedings{herlihy2023planning,\n  title={Planning to fairly allocate: Probabilistic fairness in the restless bandit setting},\n  author={Herlihy, Christine and Prins, Aviva and Srinivasan, Aravind and Dickerson, John P},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 29th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining},\n  pages={732--740},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\n@book{altman1999constrained,\n  title={Constrained Markov decision processes},\n  author={Altman, Eitan},\n  volume={7},\n  year={1999},\n  publisher={CRC Press}\n}\n\n@book{puterman1994markov,\n  title={{Markov Decision Processes: Discrete Stochastic Dynamic Programming}},\n  author={Puterman, Martin L},\n  year={1994},\n  publisher={John Wiley \\& Sons}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{rosenberg2019online,\n  title={{Online Convex Optimization in Adversarial Markov Decision Processes}},\n  author={Rosenberg, Aviv and Mansour, Yishay},\n  booktitle={Proc. of ICML},\n  year={2019}\n}\n\n\n@article{whittle1988restless,\n  title={{Restless Bandits: Activity Allocation in A Changing World}},\n  author={Whittle, Peter},\n  journal={Journal of applied probability},\n  pages={287--298},\n  year={1988},\n  publisher={JSTOR}\n}\n\n@article{weber1990index,\n  title={{On An Index Policy for Restless Bandits}},\n  author={Weber, Richard R and Weiss, Gideon},\n  journal={Journal of applied probability},\n  pages={637--648},\n  year={1990},\n  publisher={JSTOR}\n}\n\nAbstract: We consider online learning in episodic loop-free Markov decision processes (MDPs), where the loss function can change arbitrarily between episodes, and the transition function is not known to the learner.

Here the loss function can vary arbitrarily across the episodes, whereas both the loss received and the budget consumption are revealed at the end of each episode.

The state of each arm evolves according to a controlled Markov decision process (MDP), and the reward of pulling an arm depends on both the current state and action of the corresponding MDP. Since finding the optimal policy is typically intractable, we propose a computationally appealing index policy entitled Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy for the finite-horizon R(MA)^2B. Our index policy is well-defined without the requirement of indexability condition and is provably asymptotically optimal as the number of arms tends to infinity. We then adopt a learning perspective where the system parameters are unknown, and propose R(MA)^2B-UCB, a generative model based reinforcement learning augmented algorithm that can fully exploit the structure of Occupancy-Measured-Reward Index Policy. Compared to existing algorithms, R(MA)^2B-UCB performs close to offline optimum, and achieves a sub-linear regret and a low computational complexity all at once.

A restless bandit is a controllable stochastic process whose state evolution depends on whether or not the bandit is made active. Since finding the optimal control is typically intractable, we propose a class of priority policies that are proved to be asymptotically optimal under a global attractor property and a technical condition. We consider both a fixed population of bandits as well as a dynamic population where bandits can depart and arrive. As an example of a dynamic population of bandits, we analyze a multi-class M/M/S+M queue for which we show asymptotic optimality of an index policy. \nWe combine fluid-scaling techniques with linear programming results to prove that when bandits are indexable, Whittle's index policy is included in our class of priority policies. We thereby generalize a result of Weber and Weiss (1990) about asymptotic optimality of Whittle's index policy to settings with (i) several classes of bandits, (ii) arrivals of new bandits, and (iii) multiple actions. \nIndexability of the bandits is not required for our results to hold. For non-indexable bandits we describe how to select priority policies from the class of asymptotically optimal policies and present numerical evidence that, outside the asymptotic regime, the performance of our proposed priority policies is nearly optimal.\n@article{verloop2016asymptotically,\n  title={Asymptotically optimal priority policies for indexable and nonindexable restless bandits},\n  author={Verloop, Ina Maria},\n  year={2016}\n}\n\n@article{neu2021online,\n  title={Online learning in MDPs with linear function approximation and bandit feedback.},\n  author={Neu, Gergely and Olkhovskaya, Julia},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={34},\n  pages={10407--10417},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\nAbstract: We study the online restless bandit problem, where the state of each arm evolves according to a Markov chain, and the reward of pulling an arm depends on both the pulled arm and the current state of the corresponding Markov chain. In this paper, we propose Restless-UCB, a learning policy that follows the explore-then-commit framework. In Restless-UCB, we present a novel method to construct offline instances, which only requires $O(N)$ time-complexity ($N$ is the number of arms) and is exponentially better than the complexity of existing learning policy. We also prove that Restless-UCB achieves a regret upper bound of $\\tilde{O}((N+M^3)T^{2\\over 3})$, where $M$ is the Markov chain state space size and $T$ is the time horizon. Compared to existing algorithms, our result eliminates the exponential factor (in $M,N$) in the regret upper bound, due to a novel exploitation of the sparsity in transitions in general restless bandit problems. As a result, our analysis technique can also be adopted to tighten the regret bounds of existing algorithms. Finally, we conduct experiments based on real-world dataset, to compare the Restless-UCB policy with state-of-the-art benchmarks. Our results show that Restless-UCB outperforms existing algorithms in regret, and significantly reduces the running time.\n@article{wang2020restless,\n  title={Restless-UCB, an efficient and low-complexity algorithm for online restless bandits},\n  author={Wang, Siwei and Huang, Longbo and Lui, John},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={33},\n  pages={11878--11889},\n  year={2020}\n}\nAbstract: We consider the best-of-both-worlds problem for learning an episodic Markov Decision Process through T episodes, with the goal of achieving (cid:101) O ( √ T ) regret when the losses are adversarial and simultaneously O (polylog( T )) regret when the losses are (almost) stochastic. Recent work by [Jin and Luo, 2020] achieves this goal when the ﬁxed transition is known, and leaves the case of unknown transition as a major open question. In this work, we resolve this open problem by using the same Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) framework together with a set of new techniques. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst propose a loss-shifting trick in the FTRL analysis, which greatly simpliﬁes the approach of [Jin and Luo, 2020] and already improves their results for the known transition case. Then, we extend this idea to the unknown transition case and develop a novel analysis which upper bounds the transition estimation error by (a fraction of) the regret itself in the stochastic setting, a key property to ensure O (polylog( T )) regret.\n@article{jin2021best,\n  title={The best of both worlds: stochastic and adversarial episodic mdps with unknown transition},\n  author={Jin, Tiancheng and Huang, Longbo and Luo, Haipeng},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={34},\n  pages={20491--20502},\n  year={2021}\n}\nAbstract: Existing online learning algorithms for adversarial Markov Decision Processes achieve ${O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret after $T$ rounds of interactions even if the loss functions are chosen arbitrarily by an adversary, with the caveat that the transition function has to be fixed. This is because it has been shown that adversarial transition functions make no-regret learning impossible. Despite such impossibility results, in this work, we develop algorithms that can handle both adversarial losses and adversarial transitions, with regret increasing smoothly in the degree of maliciousness of the adversary. More concretely, we first propose an algorithm that enjoys $\\widetilde{{O}}(\\sqrt{T} + C^{\\textsf{P}})$ regret where $C^{\\textsf{P}}$ measures how adversarial the transition functions are and can be at most ${O}(T)$. While this algorithm itself requires knowledge of $C^{\\textsf{P}}$, we further develop a black-box reduction approach that removes this requirement. Moreover, we also show that further refinements of the algorithm not only maintains the same regret bound, but also simultaneously adapts to easier environments (where losses are generated in a certain stochastically constrained manner as in Jin et al. [2021]) and achieves $\\widetilde{{O}}(U + \\sqrt{UC^{\\textsf{L}}} + C^{\\textsf{P}})$ regret, where $U$ is some standard gap-dependent coefficient and $C^{\\textsf{L}}$ is the amount of corruption on losses.\n@article{jin2023no,\n  title={No-Regret Online Reinforcement Learning with Adversarial Losses and Transitions},\n  author={Jin, Tiancheng and Liu, Junyan and Rouyer, Chlo{\\'e} and Chan, William and We, Chen-Yu and Luo, Haipeng},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2305.17380},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\nAbstract: The standard assumption in reinforcement learning (RL) is that agents observe feedback for their actions immediately. However, in practice feedback is often observed in delay. This paper studies online learning in episodic Markov decision process (MDP) with unknown transitions, adversarially changing costs, and unrestricted delayed bandit feedback. More precisely, the feedback for the agent in episode $k$ is revealed only in the end of episode $k + d^k$, where the delay $d^k$ can be changing over episodes and chosen by an oblivious adversary. We present the first algorithms that achieve near-optimal $\\sqrt{K + D}$ regret, where $K$ is the number of episodes and $D = \\sum_{k=1}^K d^k$ is the total delay, significantly improving upon the best known regret bound of $(K + D)^{2/3}$.\n@article{jin2022near,\n  title={Near-optimal regret for adversarial mdp with delayed bandit feedback},\n  author={Jin, Tiancheng and Lancewicki, Tal and Luo, Haipeng and Mansour, Yishay and Rosenberg, Aviv},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={35},\n  pages={33469--33481},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\nAbstract: We consider online learning in a special class of episodic Markovian decision processes, namely, loop-free stochastic shortest path problems. In this problem, an agent has to traverse through a finite directed acyclic graph with random transitions while maximizing the obtained rewards along the way. We assume that the reward function can change arbitrarily between consecutive episodes, and is entirely revealed to the agent at the end of each episode. Previous work was concerned with the case when the stochastic dynamics is known ahead of time, whereas the main novelty of this paper is that this assumption is lifted. We propose an algorithm called “follow the perturbed optimistic policy” that combines ideas from the “follow the perturbed leader” method for online learning of arbitrary sequences and “upper confidence reinforcement learning”, an algorithm for regret minimization in Markovian decision processes (with a fixed reward function). We prove that the expected cumulative regret of our algorithm is of order L|X||A| p T up to logarithmic factors, where L is the length of the longest path in the graph,X is the state space, A is the action space and T is the number of episodes.

Due to its local-search nature, however, theoretical guarantees on global optimality often rely on extra assumptions on the Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) that bypass the challenge of global exploration. To eliminate the need of such assumptions, in this work, we develop a general solution that adds dilated bonuses to the policy update to facilitate global exploration. To showcase the power and generality of this technique, we apply it to several episodic MDP settings with adversarial losses and bandit feedback, improving and generalizing the state-of-the-art. Specifically, in the tabular case, we obtain $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret where $T$ is the number of episodes, improving the $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}({T}^{2/3})$ regret bound by Shani et al. (2020). When the number of states is infinite, under the assumption that the state-action values are linear in some low-dimensional features, we obtain $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}({T}^{2/3})$ regret with the help of a simulator, matching the result of Neu and Olkhovskaya (2020) while importantly removing the need of an exploratory policy that their algorithm requires.

Since ﬁnding the optimal control is typically intractable for restless bandits, existing learning algorithms are often computationally expensive or with a regret bound that is exponential in the number of arms and states. In this paper, we advocate index-aware reinforcement learning (RL) solutions to design RL algorithms operating on a much smaller dimensional subspace by exploiting the inherent structure in restless bandits. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst propose novel index policies to address dimensionality concerns, which are provably optimal. We then leverage the indices to develop two low-complexity index-aware RL algorithms, namely, (i) GM-R2MAB , which has access to a generative model; and (ii) UC-R2MAB , which learns the model using an upper conﬁdence style online exploitation method. We prove that both algorithms achieve a sub-linear regret that is only polynomial in the number of arms and states. A key differentiator between our algorithms and existing ones stems from the fact that our RL algorithms contain a novel exploitation that leverages our proposed provably optimal index policies for decision-makings.\n@article{xiong2022Neurips,\n  title={Learning infinite-horizon average-reward restless multi-action bandits via index awareness},\n  author={Xiong, Guojun and Wang, Shufan and Li, Jian},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={35},\n  pages={17911--17925},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\nAbstract: Whittle index policy is a heuristic to the intractable restless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) problem. Although it is provably asymptotically optimal, finding Whittle indices remains difficult. In this paper, we present Neural-Q-Whittle, a Whittle index based Q-learning algorithm for RMAB with neural network function approximation, which is an example of nonlinear two-timescale stochastic approximation with Q-function values updated on a faster timescale and Whittle indices on a slower timescale. Despite the empirical success of deep Q-learning, the non-asymptotic convergence rate of Neural-Q-Whittle, which couples neural networks with two-timescale Q-learning largely remains unclear. This paper provides a finite-time analysis of Neural-Q-Whittle, where data are generated from a Markov chain, and Q-function is approximated by a ReLU neural network. Our analysis leverages a Lyapunov drift approach to capture the evolution of two coupled parameters, and the nonlinearity in value function approximation further requires us to characterize the approximation error.

The decision maker (DM) aims to maximize the expected total reward over an infinite horizon under an “instantaneous activation constraint” that at most B arms can be activated at any decision epoch, where the state of each arm evolves stochastically according to a Markov decision process (MDP). However, this basic model fails to provide any fairness guarantee among arms. In this paper, we introduce RMAB-F, a new RMAB model with “long-term fairness constraints”, where the objective now is to maximize the longterm reward while a minimum long-term activation fraction for each arm must be satisfied. For the online RMAB-F setting (i.e., the underlying MDPs associated with each arm are unknown to the DM), we develop a novel reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm named Fair-UCRL. We prove that Fair-UCRL ensures probabilistic sublinear bounds on both the reward regret and the fairness violation regret. Compared with off-the-shelf RL methods, our Fair-UCRL is much more computationally efficient since it contains a novel exploitation that leverages a low-complexity index policy for making decisions. Experimental results further demonstrate the effectiveness of our Fair-UCRL.\n@inproceedings{wang2024online,\n  title={Online Restless Multi-Armed Bandits with Long-Term Fairness Constraints},\n  author={Wang, Shufan and Xiong, Guojun and Li, Jian},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence},\n  volume={38},\n  number={14},\n  pages={15616--15624},\n  year={2024}\n}\n\nAbstract: We study the dynamic cache dimensioning problem, where the objective is to decide how much storage to place in the cache to minimize the total costs with respect to the storage and content delivery latency. We formulate this problem as a Markov decision process, which turns out to be a restless multi-armed bandit problem and is provably hard to solve. For given dimensioning decisions, it is possible to develop solutions based on the celebrated Whittle index policy. However, Whittle index policy has not been studied for dynamic cache dimensioning, mainly because cache dimensioning needs to be repeatedly solved and jointly optimized with content caching. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a low-complexity fluid Whittle index policy, which jointly determines dimensioning and content caching. We show that this policy is asymptotically optimal. We further develop a lightweight reinforcement learning augmented algorithm dubbed fW-UCB when the content request and delivery rates are unavailable. fW-UCB is shown to achieve a sub-linear regret as it fully exploits the structure of the near-optimal fluid Whittle index policy and hence can be easily implemented. Extensive simulations using real traces support our theoretical results.\n@article{xiong2023reinforcement,\n  title={Reinforcement learning for dynamic dimensioning of cloud caches: A restless bandit approach},\n  author={Xiong, Guojun and Wang, Shufan and Yan, Gang and Li, Jian},\n  journal={IEEE/ACM Transactions on Networking},\n  year={2023},\n  publisher={IEEE}\n}\n\nAbstract: We study adaptive video streaming for multiple users in wireless access edge networks with unreliable channels. The key challenge is to jointly optimize the video bitrate adaptation and resource allocation such that the users' cumulative quality of experience is maximized. This problem is a finite-horizon restless multi-armed multi-action bandit problem and is provably hard to solve. To overcome this challenge, we propose a computationally appealing index policy entitled Quality Index Policy, which is well-defined without the Whittle indexability condition and is provably asymptotically optimal without the global attractor condition. These two conditions are widely needed in the design of most existing index policies, which are difficult to establish in general. Since the wireless access edge network environment is highly dynamic with system parameters unknown and time-varying, we further develop an index-aware reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm dubbed QA-UCB. We show that QA-UCB achieves a sub-linear regret with a low-complexity since it fully exploits the structure of the Quality Index Policy for making decisions. Extensive simulations using real-world traces demonstrate significant gains of proposed policies over conventional approaches. We note that the proposed framework for designing index policy and index-aware RL algorithm is of independent interest and could be useful for other large-scale multi-user problems.\n@inproceedings{xiong2022index,\n  title={Index-aware reinforcement learning for adaptive video streaming at the wireless edge},\n  author={Xiong, Guojun and Qin, Xudong and Li, Bin and Singh, Rahul and Li, Jian},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the Twenty-Third International Symposium on Theory, Algorithmic Foundations, and Protocol Design for Mobile Networks and Mobile Computing},\n  pages={81--90},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\n@article{xiong2022whittle,\n  title={Whittle index based q-learning for wireless edge caching with linear function approximation},\n  author={Xiong, Guojun and Wang, Shufan and Li, Jian and Singh, Rahul},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2202.13187},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\nAbstract: We study online learning in episodic constrained Markov decision processes (CMDPs), where the goal of the learner is to collect as much reward as possible over the episodes, while guaranteeing that some long-term constraints are satisfied during the learning process. Rewards and constraints can be selected either stochastically or adversarially, and the transition function is not known to the learner. While online learning in classical unconstrained MDPs has received considerable attention over the last years, the setting of CMDPs is still largely unexplored. This is surprising, since in real-world applications, such as, e.g., autonomous driving, automated bidding, and recommender systems, there are usually additional constraints and specifications that an agent has to obey during the learning process. In this paper, we provide the first best-of-both-worlds algorithm for CMDPs with long-term constraints. Our algorithm is capable of handling settings in which rewards and constraints are selected either stochastically or adversarially, without requiring any knowledge of the underling process. Moreover, our algorithm matches state-of-the-art regret and constraint violation bounds for settings in which constraints are selected stochastically, while it is the first to provide guarantees in the case in which they are chosen adversarially.\n@article{germano2023best,\n  title={A Best-of-Both-Worlds Algorithm for Constrained MDPs with Long-Term Constraints},\n  author={Germano, Jacopo and Stradi, Francesco Emanuele and Genalti, Gianmarco and Castiglioni, Matteo and Marchesi, Alberto and Gatti, Nicola},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2304.14326},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\nAbstract: This work addresses the problem of regret minimization in non-stochastic multi-armed bandit problems, focusing on performance guarantees that hold with high probability. Such results are rather scarce in the literature since proving them requires a large deal of technical effort and significant modifications to the standard, more intuitive algorithms that come only with guarantees that hold on expectation. One of these modifications is forcing the learner to sample arms from the uniform distribution at least Ω( √T) times over T rounds, which can adversely affect performance if many of the arms are suboptimal. While it is widely conjectured that this property is essential for proving high-probability regret bounds, we show in this paper that it is possible to achieve such strong results without this undesirable exploration component. Our result relies on a simple and intuitive loss-estimation strategy called Implicit exploration (IX) that allows a remarkably clean analysis. To demonstrate the flexibility of our technique, we derive several improved high-probability bounds for various extensions of the standard multi-armed bandit framework. Finally, we conduct a simple experiment that illustrates the robustness of our implicit exploration technique.\n@article{neu2015explore,\n  title={Explore no more: Improved high-probability regret bounds for non-stochastic bandits},\n  author={Neu, Gergely},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={28},\n  year={2015}\n}\n\nAbstract: This textbook is based on lectures given by the authors at MIPT (Moscow), HSE (Moscow), FEFU (Vladivostok), V.I.

Each restless arm is endowed with a state that evolves independently according to a Markov decision process regardless of being activated or not. In this paper, we consider the task of learning in episodic RMAB with unknown transition functions and adversarial rewards, which can change arbitrarily across episodes. Further, we consider a challenging but natural bandit feedback setting that only adversarial rewards of activated arms are revealed to the decision maker (DM). The goal of the DM is to maximize its total adversarial rewards during the learning process while the instantaneous activation constraint must be satisfied in each decision epoch. We develop a novel reinforcement learning algorithm with two key contributors: a novel biased adversarial reward estimator to deal with bandit feedback and unknown transitions, and a low-complexity index policy to satisfy the instantaneous activation constraint. We show $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound for our algorithm, where $T$ is the number of episodes and $H$ is the episode length. To our best knowledge, this is the first algorithm to ensure  $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for adversarial RMAB in our considered challenging settings.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\nRestless multi-armed bandits (RMAB) \\citep{whittle1988restless} has been widely used to study sequential decision making problems with an \\textit{``instantaneous activation constraint''} that at most $B$ out of $N$ arms can be activated at any decision epoch, ranging from wireless scheduling \\citep{sheng2014data,cohen2014restless,xiong2022index}, \nresource allocation \\citep{glazebrook2011general,larranaga2014index,xiong2023reinforcement,xiong2022whittle}, \nto healthcare \\citep{killian2021beyond}.  %Specifically, the decision maker (DM) can pull $B$ out of $N$ arms at each decision epoch. \nEach arm is described by a Markov decision process (MDP) \\citep{puterman1994markov}, and evolves stochastically according to two different transition kernels, depending on whether the arm is activated or not. Rewards are generated with each transition. The goal of the decision maker (DM) is to maximize the total expected reward over a finite-horizon \\citep{xiong2022AAAI} or an infinite-horizon \\citep{wang2020restless,avrachenkov2022whittle,xiong2022Neurips,xiong2023finite,wang2024online} under the instantaneous activation constraint. \nThe majority of the literature on RMAB consider a stochastic environment, where both the rewards and dynamics of the environments are assumed to be stationary over time. However, in real-world applications such as online advertising and revenue management, rewards\\footnote{Although most existing literature on adversarial learning use the term ``loss'' instead of ``reward'', we choose to use the latter, or more specifically ``adversarial reward''\nin this paper to be consistent with RMAB literature. One can translate between rewards and losses by taking negation.} are not necessarily stationary but can change arbitrarily between episodes \\citep{lee2023online}. To this end, we study the problem of learning \\textit{a finite-horizon adversarial RMAB (\\armab) with unknown transitions} over $T$ episodes. In each episode, all arms start from a fixed initial state, and the DM repeats the followings for a fixed number of $H$ decision epochs: determine whether or not to activate each arm while the instantaneous activation constraint must be satisfied, receive adversarial rewards from each arm, which transits to the next state according to some unknown transition functions. Specifically, we consider a challenging but natural \\textit{bandit feedback} setting, where the adversarial rewards in each decision epoch are only revealed to the DM when the state-action pairs are visited. The goal of the DM is to minimize its regret, which is the difference between its total adversarial rewards and the total rewards received by an optimal fixed policy. \n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Comparison with existing works, where $T$ is the number of episodes and $H$ is the length of each episode. }\n\\scalebox{0.85}{\n\\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\nPaper & Model & Setting &Feedback & Constraint & Algorithm & Regret \\\\\\hline\n\\hline \\cite{rosenberg2019online}& MDP & Adversarial& {Full} & \\ding{55} & OMD & $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$\\\\ \n\\cite{rosenberg2019b} & MDP & Adversarial& {Bandi}t & \\ding{55}& OMD & $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^{2/3}T^{3/4})$\\\\\n\\cite{jin2020learning} & MDP &  Adversarial&{Bandit} & \\ding{55} & OMD & $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$ \\\\ \n\\cite{luo2021policy} & MDP & Adversarial& {Bandit} & \\ding{55} & Policy Optimization & $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^2\\sqrt{T})$\\\\\n\\hline\n\\cite{qiu2020upper} & CMDP & Adversarial&{Full} & {Average} & Primal-dual& $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$\\\\\n\\cite{germano2023best} & CMDP & Adversarial& {Full} & {Average} & Primal-dual& $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(HT^{3/4})$\\\\\n\\hline\n\\cite{wang2020restless} & RMAB & Stochastic&{Full} & Hard & Generative model& $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^{2/3}T^{2/3})$\\\\\n\\cite{xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips} & RMAB & Stochastic&{Full} & Hard & Index-based& $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{HT})$\\\\ \\hline\n\\textbf{This Work} & \\textbf{RMAB} & \\textbf{Adversarial}& \\textbf{Bandit} & \\textbf{Hard} & \\textbf{Index-based OMD}&${\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})}$\\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\label{table:1}\n\\end{table*}\nTo achieve this goal, we develop an episodic reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm named \\ucarmab. First, to handle unknown transitions of each arm, we construct confidence sets to guarantee the true ones lie in these sets with high probability (Section~\\ref{sec:confidence-set}). Second, to handle adversarial rewards, we apply Online Mirror Descent (OMD) to solve a relaxed problem, rather than directly on \\armab, in terms of occupancy measures (Section~\\ref{sec:OMD}). This is due to the fact that \\armab is known to be computationally intractable even in the offline setting \\citep{papadimitriou1994complexity}. We note that OMD has also been used in  adversarial MDP \\citep{rosenberg2019online, jin2020learning} and CMDP \\citep{qiu2020upper}. However, they considered a stationary occupancy measure due to the existing of stationary policies, which is not the case for our finite-horizon RMAB with instantaneous activation constraint. This requires us to leverage a time-dependent occupancy measure. \nThird, a key difference compared to stochastic RMAB \\citep{wang2020restless,xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips} is that with bandit feedback and to apply the above OMD, we must construct adversarial reward estimators since the rewards of arms are not completely revealed to the DM. We address this challenge by developing a novel biased overestimated reward estimator (Section~\\ref{sec:estimator}) based on the observations of counts for each state-action pairs.  Finally, to handle the instantaneous activation constraint in \\armab, we develop a low-complexity index policy (Section~\\ref{sec:index}) based on the solutions from the OMD in Section~\\ref{sec:OMD}. This is another key difference compared to adversarial MDP or CMDP, which requires us to explicitly characterize the regret due to the implementation of such an index policy.\nWe prove that \\ucarmab achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$ regret, where $T$ is the number of episodes and $H$ is the episode length. Although our regret bound exhibits a gap (i.e., $\\sqrt{H}$ times larger) to that of stochastic RMAB \\citep{xiong2022AAAI, xiong2022Neurips}, to our best knowledge, our result is the first to achieve $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret for adversarial RMAB with bandit feedback and unknown transition functions, a harder problem compared to stochastic RMABs. \n \n\n\\textbf{Notations.}  We use calligraphy letter $\\mathcal{A}$ to denote a finite set with cardinality $|\\mathcal{A}|$, and $[N]$ to denote the set of integers $\\{1,\\cdots, N\\}$.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\nWe discuss our related work from three categories: MDP, CMDP and RMAB. In particular, we mainly focus on the adversarial settings for the former two. \n\n\\textbf{Adversarial MDP.} \\citet{even2009online} proposed the adversarial MDP model with arbitrarily changed loss functions and a fixed stochastic transition function. The first to consider unknown transition function with full information feedback is \\citet{neu2012adversarial}, which proposed a Follow-the-Perturbed-Optimistic algorithm with an $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H|\\cS||\\cA|\\sqrt{T})$ regret.  \\citet{rosenberg2019online} improved the bound to $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H|\\cS|\\sqrt{|\\cA|T})$ through a UCRL2-based online optimization algorithm.  A more challenging bandit feedback setting was considered in \\citet{rosenberg2019b}, which achieves an $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^{3/2}|\\cS||\\cA|^{1/4}T^{3/4})$ regret. \\citet{jin2020learning} further achieves an improved $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H|\\cS|\\sqrt{|\\cA|T})$ regret via a novel reward estimator and a modified radius of upper confidence ball. Under a similar setting, a policy optimization method is developed in \\citet{luo2021policy} with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^2|\\cS|\\sqrt{|\\cA|T})$ regret. \nAnother line of recent works further consider the settings of linear function approximation \\citep{neu2021online}, the best-of-both-world \\citep{jin2021best}, delay bandit feedback \\citep{jin2022near} and adversarial transition functions \\citep{jin2023no}. \n\n\\textbf{Adversarial Constrained MDP (CMDP).} CMDP \\citep{altman1999constrained} plays an important role in control and planning, which aims to maximize a reward over all available policies subject to constraints that enforce the fairness or safety of the policies. \\citet{qiu2020upper} is one of the first to study CMDP with adversarial losses and unknown transition function. A primal-dual algorithm was proposed with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H|\\cS|\\sqrt{|\\cA|T})$ regret and constraint violation. \\citet{germano2023best} further considered both adversarial losses and constraints, and proposed a best-of-both-world algorithm, which achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(HT^{3/4})$ regret and constraint violation. \n\n\\textbf{RMAB.} RMAB was first introduced in \\citet{whittle1988restless}, and has been widely studied, see \\citet{nino2023markovian} and references therein. In particular, RL algorithms have been proposed for RMAB with unknown transitions. Colored-UCRL2 is the state-of-the-art method for {online RMAB with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{HT})$ regret. To address the exponential computational complexity of colored-UCRL2, low-complexity RL algorithms have been developed. For example, \\citet{wang2020restless} proposed a generative model-based algorithm with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H^{2/3}T^{2/3})$ regret, and \\citet{xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips} designed index-aware RL algorithms for both finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average reward settings with $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{HT})$ regret\\footnote{For a fair comparison, the total time horizon for stochastic RMAB \\citep{wang2020restless,xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips} is set to be $HT$.}. However, most of the existing literature on RMAB focus on the stochastic setting, where the reward functions are stochastically sampled from a fixed distribution, either known or unknown. To our best knowledge, this work is the first to study RMAB in adversarial settings with unknown transition functions and bandit feedback. \n\n\n\n\n\\section{Model and Problem Formulation}\n\n\nWe formally define the adversarial RMAB, and introduce the online settings considered in this paper.\n\n\\subsection{\\armab: Adversarial RMAB}\n\nConsider an episodic adversarial RMAB with $N$ arms. Each arm $n\\in[N]$ is associated with a  unichain MDP denoted by a tuple $(\\cS, \\cA, P_n, \\{r_n^t, \\forall t\\in[T]\\}, H)$. $\\cS$ is a finite state space, and $\\cA:=\\{0,1\\}$ is the set of binary actions. Using the standard terminology from RMAB literature, an arm is \\textit{passive} when action $a=0$ is applied to it, and \\textit{active} otherwise. $P_n:\\cS\\times\\cA\\times\\cS\\mapsto[0,1]$ is the transition kernel with $P_n(s^\\prime|s,a)$ being the probability of transition to state $s^\\prime$ from state $s$ by taking action $a$. $T$ is the number of episodes, each of which consists of $H$ decision epochs.  $r_n^t: \\cS\\times\\cA\\mapsto [0,1]$ is the adversarial reward function in episode $t$. For simplicity, let $r_n(s,0)=0, \\forall s\\in\\cS, n\\in[N]$.  We do not make any statistical assumption on the adversarial reward functions, \\textit{which can be chosen arbitrarily}\\footnote{\nHowever, in stochastic RMAB, rewards follow a stochastic distribution, which is fixed between episodes. This leads to a different objective in adversarial RMAB as the DM must adapt to dynamic and potentially hostile reward structures while striving to find an optimal policy across all episodes.}. \n\nAt decision epoch $h\\in[H]$ in episode $t\\in[T]$, an arm can be either active or passive. A policy determines what action to apply to each arm at $h$ under the instantaneous activation constraint that at most $B$ arms can be activated. Denote such a feasible policy in episode $t$ as $\\pi^t$, and let $\\{(S_n^{t,h}, A_n^{t,h})\\in\\cS\\times \\cA, \\forall t\\in[T], h\\in[H], n\\in[N]\\}$ be the random tuple generated according to transition functions $\\{P_n, \\forall n\\in[N]\\}$ and $\\pi^t$. \nThe corresponding expected reward in episode $t$ is \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:reward-ept}\n   R_t (\\pi^t)\\!:= \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\sum_{n=1}^N \\!r_n^t(S_n^{t,h},A_n^{t,h})\\Big|\\{P_n, \\!\\forall n\\}, \\pi^t\\right].\n\\end{align}\nThe DM's goal is to find a policy $\\pi$ for all $T$ episodes which maximizes the total expected adversarial reward under the instantaneous active constraint, i.e., \n\\begin{align}\n\\armab: \\max_{\\pi}~ &R(T, \\pi):=\\sum_{t=1}^T  R_t(\\pi)\\allowdisplaybreaks\\nonumber\\\\ \n\\text{s.t.}~ & \\sum_{n=1}^N A_n^{t,h}\\leq B, \\forall h\\in [H] ,t\\in [T].\n    \\label{eq:orginal_P}\n\\end{align}\nIt is known that even when the transition kernel of each arm and the adversarial reward functions in each episode are revealed to the DM at the very beginning, {finding an optimal policy over $T$ episodes, denoted as $\\pi^{opt}$ for \\armab~(\\ref{eq:orginal_P})} is PSPACE-hard \\citep{papadimitriou1994complexity}. The fundamental challenge lies in the explosion of state space and the curse of dimensionality prevents computing optimal policies. Exacerbating this challenge is the fact that transition kernels are often unknown in practice, and {adversarial reward functions are only revealed to the DM at the end of each episode in adversarial settings (see Section~\\ref{sec:online-setting}).} \n\\begin{remark}\nMost existing works on adversarial MDP \\citep{rosenberg2019online,rosenberg2019b, jin2020learning} and CMDP  \\citep{qiu2020upper, germano2023best} assume that the state space is loop-free. In other words, the state space $\\cS$ can be divided into $L$ distinct layers, i.e., $\\cS:=\\cS_1\\cup\\ldots\\cup\\cS_L$ with a singleton initial layer $\\cS_1=\\{s_1\\}$, a terminal layer $\\cS_L=\\{s_L\\}$, and $\\cS_\\ell \\cap \\cS_j=\\emptyset, j\\neq \\ell.$ Transitions only occur between consecutive layers, i.e., $P(s^\\prime|s,a)>0$ if $s^\\prime \\in \\cS_{\\ell+1}, s\\in\\cS_\\ell, \\forall \\ell\\in[L]$. \nOn one hand, many practical problems do not have a loop-free MDP. On the other hand, this assumption requires any non-loop-free MDP to extend its state space $L$ times to be transformed into a loop-free MDP with a fixed length $L$. This often enlarges the regret bound at least $L$ times. In this paper, we consider a general MDP  without such a restrictive loop-free assumption. \n\\end{remark}\n\n\\subsection{Online Setting and Learning Regret}\\label{sec:online-setting}\n\\begin{algorithm}[t]\n\t\\caption{{Online Interactions between the DM and the Adversarial RMAB Environment}}\n\t\\label{alg:importance-policy}\n\t\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n\t\t\\REQUIRE State space $\\cS$, action space $\\cA$, and unknown transition functions $\\{\\cP_n, \\forall n\\}$;\n  \\FOR{$t=1$ to $T$}\n\\STATE {All arms start in state $S_n^{0}, \\forall n$;}\n\\STATE Adversary decides the reward function $\\{r_n^t, \\forall n\\}$, and the DM decides a policy $\\pi^t$; \n  \\FOR{$h=1$ to $H$}\n  \\STATE DM chooses actions $\\{A_{n}^{t,h}, \\forall n\\}$ under the instantaneous activation constraint; observes adversarial reward $\\{r_n^t(S_n^{t,h}, A_n^{t,h}),\\forall n\\}$; \\STATE Arm $n, \\forall n$ moves to the next state $S_n^{t,h+1}\\sim P_n(\\cdot|S_n^{t,h},A_n^{t,h})$ ;\n  \\STATE DM observes states $\\{S_n^{t,h+1}, \\forall n\\}$.\n  \\ENDFOR\n\t \\ENDFOR \n\t\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\nWe focus on the online adversarial settings where the underlying MDPs are unknown to the DM, and the adversarial reward is of bandit-feedback\\footnote{We use the term ``bandit-feedback'' as in \\citet{rosenberg2019b, jin2020learning} to denote that only the adversarial rewards of visited state-action pairs are revealed to the DM. }.\nThe interaction between the DM and the \\armab environment is presented in Algorithm~\\ref{alg:importance-policy}. Only the state and action spaces are known to the DM in advance, and the interaction proceeds in $T$ episodes. At the beginning of episode $t$, the adversary determines the adversarial reward functions, each arm $n$ starts from a fixed state $S_n^0, \\forall n\\in[N]$, and the DM determines a policy $\\pi^t$ and then executes this policy for each decision epoch $h\\in[H]$ in this episode. Specifically, at decision epoch $h$, the DM chooses actions $\\{A_{n}^{t,h}, \\forall n\\in \\cN\\}$ for each arm according to $\\pi^t(\\cdot|S_n^{t,h})$ under the instantaneous activation constraint, i.e., $\\sum_{n=1}^N A_{n}^{t,h}=B$, and each arm then moves to the next state $S_n^{t,h+1}$ sampled from $P_n(\\cdot|S_n^{t,h},A_n^{t,h})$. The DM records the trajectory of the current episode $t$ and the adversarial rewards in each decision epoch are \\textit{only revealed to the DM when the state-action pairs are visited due to bandit-feedback.} \n \n\nThe DM's goal is to minimize its regret, as defined by\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:regret}\n    \\Delta(T):=R(T, \\pi^{opt})-\\sum_{t=1}^T R_t(\\pi^t), \n\\end{align}\nwhere $R(T, \\pi^{opt})$ is the total expected adversarial rewards under the offline optimal policy $\\pi^{opt}$ by solving~(\\ref{eq:orginal_P}), and $R_t(\\pi^t)$ is defined in~(\\ref{eq:reward-ept}). We simply refer to \\armab as in the online setting in the rest of this paper. \nAlthough the above definition is similar to that in stochastic settings, the fundamental difference is that the offline policy $\\pi^{opt}$ is only optimal when it is defined over all $T$ episodes, and it is not guaranteed to be optimal in each episode, which is the case for stochastic setting. This is because the adversarial rewards can change arbitrarily between episodes rather than following some fixed (unknown) distribution as in the stochastic setting. This fundamental difference will necessitate new techniques in terms of regret characterization, which we will discuss in details in Section~\\ref{sec:analysis}. \n\n\n\n```\n\n## Experimental Setup\n\n```json\n[{\"name\": \"Comparison with Existing Works\", \"description\": \"The paper compares the proposed algorithm with existing works in terms of model, setting, feedback, constraint, algorithm, and regret.

Specifically, we leverage the popular UCRL-based algorithm to the online adversarial RMAB setting, and\ndevelop an episodic RL algorithm named \\ucarmab.  There are four key components of our algorithm: (1) maintaining a confidence set of the transition functions; (2) using online mirror descent (OMD) to solve a relaxed version of \\armab in terms of occupancy measure to deal with adversarial rewards; (3) constructing an adversarial reward estimator to deal with bandit feedback;  and (4) designing a low-complexity index policy to ensure that the instantaneous activation constraint is satisfied in each decision epoch.  We summarize our \\ucarmab in Algorithm \\ref{alg:UCB}, which operates in an episodic manner with a total of $T$ episodes and each episode including $H$ decision epochs. For simplicity, let $\\tau_t:= H(t-1)+1$ be the starting time of the $t$-th episode. \n\\begin{algorithm}[t]\n\t\\caption{\\ucarmab}\n\t\\label{alg:UCB}\n\t\\begin{algorithmic}[1]\n     \\REQUIRE  Initialize $C_n^{1}(s,a)=0,$  $\\hat{P}_n^{1}(s^\\prime|s,a)=1/|\\cS|$\t\n\t\t\\FOR{$t=1,2,\\cdots,T$}\n\t \\STATE Construct $\\cP_n^{t}(s,a)$   according to \\eqref{eq:confidence_ball} at $\\tau_t$; \t\t\n  \\STATE Construct the adversarial reward estimator $\\hat{r}_n^t(s,a), \\forall s, a, n$ according to \\eqref{eq:reward_estimator};\n  \\STATE Obtain a relaxed \\armab \\eqref{eq:relaxed_constraint} in terms of occupancy measure, and solve \\eqref{eq:UCB_extended} with OMD; \n  \\STATE Construct an index policy $\\pi^{t}$ according to~(\\ref{eq:importance-index}). \n\t\t\\ENDFOR\n\t\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\n\\subsection{Confidence Sets}\\label{sec:confidence-set}\n\nAs discussed in Section~\\ref{sec:model}, \\armab has two components: a stochastic transition function, and an adversarial reward function for each arm. Since transition functions are unknown to the DM, we maintain confidence sets via past sample trajectories, which contain true transition functions $P_n, \\forall n$ with high probability. Specifically, \\ucarmab maintains two counts for each arm $n$.  Let $C_n^{t-1}(s,a), \\forall n\\in[N]$ be the number of visits to state-action pairs $(s,a)$ until $\\tau_t$, and $C_n^{t-1}(s,a, s^\\prime), \\forall n\\in[N]$ be the number of transitions from $s$ to $s^\\prime$ under action $a$. At episode $t$, \\ucarmab updates these two counts as: $\\forall (s,a,s^\\prime)\\in\\mathcal{S}\\times\\mathcal{A}\\times\\mathcal{S}$\n\\begin{align*}\n    C_n^{t}(s,a)&=C_n^{t-1}(s,a)+\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\mathds{1}(S_n^{t,h}=s,A_n^{t,h}=a),\\displaybreak[0]\\\\\n    C_n^{t}(s,a, s^\\prime)&=C_n^{t-1}(s,a, s^\\prime)\\displaybreak[1]\\\\\n    &+\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\mathds{1}(S_n^{t,h+1}=s^\\prime|S_n^{t,h}=s,A_n^{t,h}=a).\n\\end{align*}\n\\ucarmab estimates the true transition function by the corresponding empirical average as:\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:empirical_est_P}\n\\hat{P}_n^{t}(s^\\prime|s,a)=\\frac{C_n^{t-1}(s,a,s^\\prime)}{\\max\\{C_n^{t-1}(s,a),1\\}},\n\\end{align}\nand then defines confidence sets at episode $t$ as \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:confidence_ball} \n \\cP_n^{t}(s,a)&:=\\{\\tilde{P}_n^t(s^\\prime|s,a),\\forall s^\\prime:\\nonumber\\\\\n &\\quad\\quad|\\tilde{P}_n^t(s^\\prime|s,\\!a)\\!-\\!\\hat{P}_n^{t}(s^\\prime|s,\\!a)|\\!\\leq\\! \\delta_n^{t}(s,\\!a)\\},\n\\end{align}\nwhere the confidence width $\\delta_n^{t}(s,a)$ is built according to the Hoeffding inequality \\citep{maurer2009empirical} as: for $\\epsilon\\in(0,1)$ \n\\begin{align}\n\\delta_n^{t}(s,a)\\!=\\!\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2C_n^{t-1}(s,a)}\\!\\log\\!\\Big(\\frac{4|\\cS||\\cA|N(t\\!-\\!1)H}{\\epsilon}\\Big)}.\n\\end{align}\n\n\\begin{lemma}\nWith probability at least $1-2\\epsilon$, the true transition functions are within the confidence sets, i.e., $P_n\\in \\cP_n^{t}$, $\\forall n\\in[N], t\\in[T].$\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\n\\subsection{Solving Relaxed \\armab with OMD}\\label{sec:OMD}\nRecall that solving \\armab is computationally expensive even in the offline setting \\citep{papadimitriou1994complexity}. To tackle this challenge, we first relax the instantaneous activation constraint, i.e., the activation constraint is satisfied on average, and obtain the following relaxed problem of \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:relaxed_constraint}\n\\max_{\\pi}~ &R(T, \\pi):=\\sum_{t=1}^T  R_t(\\pi)\\displaybreak[0]\\nonumber\\\\ \n   \\text{s.t.}~ & \\mathbb{E}_{\\pi}\\left[\\sum_{n=1}^N A_n^{t,h}\\right]\\leq B, ~h\\in[H], t\\in[T]. \n\\end{align}\nIt turns out that this relaxed \\armab can be equivalently transformed into a linear programming (LP) using occupancy measure \\citep{altman1999constrained}. \nMore specifically, the occupancy measure $\\mu$ of a policy $\\pi$ for a finite-horizon MDP is defined as the expected number of visits to a state-action pair $(s, a)$ at each decision epoch $h$.  Formally,\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:OM}\n\\mu^\\pi=& \\Big\\{\\mu_n(s,a;h)=\\mathbb{P}(S_n^h=s, A_n^h=a)\\nonumber\\\\\n&\\qquad: \\forall n\\in[N], s\\in\\cS, a\\in\\cA, h\\in[H] \\Big\\}.\n\\end{align}\nIt can be easily checked that occupancy measures satisfy the following two properties. First, \n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{s\\in\\cS}\\sum_{a\\in\\cA}\\mu_n(s,a;h)=1, \\forall n\\in[N], h\\in[H],\n\\end{align}\nwith $0\\leq \\mu_n(s,a;h)\\leq 1$.  Hence the occupancy measure $\\mu_n$, $\\forall n$ is a probability measure. Second, the fluid balance exists in occupancy measure transitions as\n\\begin{align}\n\\sum_{a\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\!\\!\\mu_n(s,a;h)\\!=\\!\\!\\sum_{s^\\prime}\\!\\sum_{ a^\\prime}\\!\\mu_n(s^\\prime,\\!a^\\prime; h\\!-\\!1)P_n(s^\\prime,\\!a^\\prime,\\!s).\n\\end{align}\nFor ease of presentation, we relegate the details of the equivalent LP of~(\\ref{eq:relaxed_constraint}) to the supplementary materials.\n\n\\begin{remark}\\label{remark:OM}\nOccupancy measure has been widely used in adversarial MDP \\cite{rosenberg2019online, jin2020learning} and CMDP \\cite{qiu2020upper}. Since there exists a stationary policy in these settings, the regret minimization problem in \\citet{rosenberg2019online, jin2020learning, qiu2020upper} can be equivalently reduced to an online linear optimization in terms of the stationary occupancy measure. Unlike these works, there is no such stationary policy for our considered finite-horizon RMAB with the instantaneous activation constraint, and hence we cannot reduce our regret~(\\ref{eq:regret}) into a linear optimization using stationary occupancy measure. To address this additional challenge, we leverage the time-dependent occupancy measure~(\\ref{eq:OM}), and the regret minimization calls for different proof techniques (see Section~\\ref{sec:analysis} for details). \n\\end{remark}\n \nUnfortunately, we cannot solve this LP since we have no knowledge about the true transition functions and adversarial rewards. Similar to the stochastic setting \\cite{xiong2022AAAI, xiong2022Neurips} and with the confidence sets defined in Section~\\ref{sec:confidence-set}, we can further rewrite this LP as an extended LP by leveraging the \\textit{state-action-state occupancy measure} $z_n^t(s, a, s^\\prime; h)$ defined as $z_n^t(s, a, s^\\prime; h)=P_n(s^\\prime|s,a)\\mu_n^t(s,a;h)$ to express the confidence intervals of the transition probabilities. Unlike \\citet{xiong2022AAAI, xiong2022Neurips}, the adversarial rewards can change arbitrarily between episodes, and hence we also need to guarantee that the updated occupancy measure in episode $t$ does not deviate too much away from the previously chosen occupancy measure in episode $t-1$. Thus, we further incorporate $D(z^t||z^{t-1})$ into the objective function, which is the unnormalized Kullback-Leible (KL) divergence between two occupancy measures, which is defined as\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:KL_divergence}\n\\hspace{-0.3cm}D(z^t||z^{t-1})&:=\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\sum_{s,a,s^\\prime}z^t(s,a,s^\\prime;h)\\ln\\frac{z^t(s,a,s^\\prime;h)}{z^{t-1}(s,a,s^\\prime;h)}\\nonumber\\\\\n&\\qquad-z^t(s,a,s^\\prime;h)+z^{t-1}(s,a,s^\\prime;h).\n\\end{align}\nThe DM needs to solve a non-linear problem over $z^t:=\\{z_n^t(s, a, s^\\prime; h), \\forall n\\in[N]\\}$ for a given parameter $\\eta>0$:  \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:UCB_extended}\n\\max_{z^t}&\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\!\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\!\\sum_{(s,a,s^\\prime)}\\!\\!\\! \\eta z_n^t(s,a, s^\\prime;h)\\hat{r}_n^{t-1}(s,a)\\!-\\!D(z^t||z^{t-1})\\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\\n\\mbox{ s.t.} &\\sum_{n=1}^{N}\\sum_{(s,a,s^\\prime)} az_n^t(s,a,s^\\prime; h) \\le B ,\\quad~\\forall h\\in[H], \\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\\n&{\\sum_{a, s^\\prime}} z_n^t(s,a,s^\\prime;h)\\!=\\!\\!\\!\\sum_{s^\\prime, a^\\prime}\\!z_n^t(s^\\prime, a^\\prime, s; h-1),\\forall h\\!\\in\\![H],  \\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\ \n&~\\frac{z_n^t(s,a,s^\\prime;h)}{\\sum_y z_n^t(s,a,y;h)}-(\\hat{P}_n^t(s^\\prime|s,a)+\\delta_n^t(s,a))\\leq 0, \\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\ \n&-\\frac{z_n^t(s,a,s^\\prime;h)}{\\sum_y z_n^t(s,a,y;h)}\\!+\\!(\\hat{P}_n^t(s^\\prime|s,a)\\!-\\!\\delta_n^t(s,a))\\!\\leq\\! 0, \\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\ \n& z_n^t(s,a, s^\\prime;h)\\!\\geq\\! 0,  \\forall s,s^\\prime\\!\\in\\mathcal{S}, a\\!\\in\\!\\mathcal{A},\\forall n\\!\\in\\![N], \n\\end{align}\nwhere $\\hat{r}_n^{t-1}(s,a)$ is the estimated adversarial reward due to bandit feedback, and we formally define it in Section~\\ref{sec:estimator}. \n\nThis problem has $O(|\\mathcal{S}|^2|\\mathcal{A}|HN)$ constraints and decision variables. Inspired by \\citet{rosenberg2019online}, we solve~(\\ref{eq:UCB_extended}) via OMD to choose the occupancy measure for each episode $t$. We first solve a unconstrained problem by setting $\\tilde{z}^{t}(s,a,s^\\prime; h)=z^{t-1}(s,a,s^\\prime;h)e^{\\eta \\hat{r}^{t-1}(s,a)}$. Then we project the unconstrained maximizer $\\tilde{z}^{t}$ into the feasible set $\\cZ^t$, which is defined by the constraints in \\eqref{eq:UCB_extended}. This can be reduced to a convex optimization problem, and can be efficiently solved using iterative methods \\citep{boyd2004convex}. For ease of readability, we relegate the details of solving \\eqref{eq:UCB_extended} to the supplementary materials.  Denote the optimal solution to~(\\ref{eq:UCB_extended}) as $z^{t,\\star}$. \n\n\n\\subsection{Adversarial Reward Estimators}\\label{sec:estimator} \nSince we consider a challenging bandit feedback setting, where the adversarial rewards in each decision epoch are revealed to the DM only when the state-action pairs are visited, we need to construct adversarial reward estimators based on observations. Specifically, we build upon the inverse importance-weighted estimators based on the observation of counts for each state-action pairs. Given the trajectory for episode $t$, a straightforward estimator is \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:unbias}\n\\frac{r_n(s,a)}{\\max\\{c_n^t(s,a),1\\}/H}\\mathds{1}(\\exists h, S_n^{t,h}=s, A_n^{t,h}=a), \n\\end{align}\nwhere $c_n^t(s,a):=\\sum_{h=1}^{H}\\mathds{1}(S_n^{t,h}=s,A_n^{t,h}=a)$ is the number of visits to state-action pair $(s,a)$ in episode $t$. For simplicity, we denote $\\bar{r}_n^{t}(s,a):=\\frac{r_n(s,a)}{\\max\\{c_n^t(s,a),1\\}/H}$. Clearly, $\\bar{r}_n^{t}(s,a)\\mathds{1}(\\exists h, S_n^{t,h}=s, A_n^{t,h}=a)$ is an unbiased estimator of ${r}_n^{t}(s,a)$ from the above definition. A key difference between the unbiased estimator in \\eqref{eq:unbias} and those in previous works on adversarial MDPs  \\citep{jin2020learning, rosenberg2019online} lies in the construction of the denominator in \\eqref{eq:unbias}. Specifically, \\citet{jin2020learning, rosenberg2019online} considered MDPs with a underlying stationary policy, and hence the evolution of the dynamics in the considered MDPs will converge to this stationary policy. This enables the construction of the denominator in the estimator using the occupancy measure for each for each state-action pair under such a policy. In contrast, it is known that the dynamics in RMAB cannot converge to the stationary policy due to the fact that RMABs implement an index policy (see Section~\\ref{sec:index}) to deal with the instantaneous activation constraint, and it is only provably in the asymptotic regime \\cite{weber1990index,verloop2016asymptotically}. This render the approaches in  \\citet{jin2020learning, rosenberg2019online} not applicable to ours, and necessitates different methods to construct the estimator as in \\eqref{eq:unbias}. \n\n\nSince we consider the bandit feedback, we further leverage the idea of implicit exploration as inspired by \\citet{neu2015explore,jin2020learning} to further encourage exploration. Specifically, we further increase $\\bar{r}_n^{t}(s,a)$ with a bonus term $\\delta_n^t(s,a)$ to obtain a biased estimator $(\\bar{r}_n^{t}(s,a)+\\delta_n^t(s,a))\\mathds{1}(\\exists h, S_n^{t,h}=s, A_n^{t,h}=a)$. Since $r_n^t(s,a)\\in[0,1]$ and to guarantee that this biased estimator is an overestimate, we further add the term $1-\\mathds{1}(\\exists h, S_n^{t,h}=s, A_n^{t,h}=a)$. Thus, our final adversarial reward estimator is $\\hat{r}_n^{t}(s,a)$\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:reward_estimator}\n    =&\\min\\Big((\\bar{r}_n^{t}(s,a)+\\delta_n^t(s,a)) \\mathds{1}(\\exists h, S_n^{t,h}=s, A_n^{t,h}=a), 1\\Big) \\nonumber\\\\\n    &\\qquad\\qquad+ 1-\\mathds{1}(\\exists h, S_n^{t,h}=s, A_n^{t,h}=a).\n\\end{align}\nGiven the above constructions, it is clear that $\\hat{r}_n^{t}(s,a)$ is a biased estimator upper-bounded by $1$ and is overestimating  $r_n^t(s,a), \\forall s, a, n, t$ with high probability. Using overestimates for adversarial learning with bandit feedback can be viewed as an optimism principle to encourage exploration. This is beneficial for the regret characterization as the deterministic overestimation as in \\citet{jin2020learning} to guarantee a tighter regret bound.\n\n\\begin{remark}\nThe reward estimator in stochastic RMAB \\citep{xiong2022AAAI, xiong2022Neurips} is simply defined as the sample mean using all trajectories up to episode $t$, which cannot be applied to our adversarial RMAB. This is due to the fact that the rewards are assumed to be drawn from an unknown but fixed distribution across all episodes for stochastic RMAB, while rewards can change arbitrarily between episodes for adversarial RMAB. The bandit-feedback setting further differentiates our adversarial RMAB from classical stochastic ones. Finally, we note that \\citet{jin2020learning} considered the bandit feedback for adversarial MDP, and also constructed an adversarial loss/reward estimator. Since the regret minimization problem in \\citet{jin2020learning} can be reduced to an online linear optimization using stationary occupancy measure (see Remark~\\ref{remark:OM}), the estimator can be constructed directly using the stationary occupancy measure.  Since there is no such stationary policy for our finite-horizon adversarial RMAB, this makes the estimator in \\citet{jin2020learning} not directly applicable to ours, and necessitates different construction techniques as discussed above. \n\\end{remark}\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.95\\textwidth]{Adversarial_RMAB_flow.pdf}\n    \\caption{The workflow of \\ucarmab and its regret analysis. The dashed arrows present the aimed procedures for solving the original problem in \\eqref{eq:orginal_P}, and the solid arrows show the true procedures of \\ucarmab. By relaxing the ``hard'' activation constraint as shown in \\eqref{eq:relaxed_constraint},  \\ucarmab updates occupancy measure via OMD as in \\eqref{eq:UCB_extended} (see Section~\\ref{sec:OMD}), combined with the adversarial reward estimator in \\eqref{eq:reward_estimator} (see Section~\\ref{sec:estimator}). Then, it establishes the RMI index policy in \\eqref{eq:importance-index} (see Section~\\ref{sec:index}). These correspond to the \\textbf{three sources of learning regret}, i.e., regret due to (i) OMD online optimization (Lemma \\ref{lem:term1}), (ii) bandit-feedback adversarial reward (Lemma \\ref{lem:term2}), and (iii) the RMI index policy (Lemma \\ref{lem:term3}).}\n\n    \\label{fig:Flowchart}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\subsection{Index Policy for \\armab}\\label{sec:index}\nUnfortunately, the optimal solution $z^{t,\\star}$ to~(\\ref{eq:UCB_extended}) is not always feasible for our \\armab due to the fact that the instantaneous activation constraint in \\armab must be satisfied in each decision epoch rather than on the average sense as in~(\\ref{eq:UCB_extended}). Inspired by \\citet{xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips}, we further construct an index policy on top of $z^{t,\\star}$ that is feasible for \\armab. Specifically, since $\\cA:=\\{0,1\\}$, i.e., an arm can be either active or passive at each decision epoch $h$, we define the index assigned to arm $n$ in state $S_n^{t, h}=s$ at decision epoch $h$ of episode $t$ to be as \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:importance-index}\n\\mathcal{I}_n^t(s;h):=\\frac{\\sum_{s^\\prime}z_n^{t,\\star}(s,1,s^\\prime;h)}{\\sum_{b,s^\\prime}z_n^{t,\\star}(s,b,s^\\prime;h)},\\quad \\forall n\\in[N].\n\\end{align}\nWe call this the reward-maximizing index (RMI) since $\\mathcal{I}_n^t(s;h)$ indicates the probability of activating arm $n$ in state $s$ at decision epoch $h$ of episode $t$ towards maximizing the total expected adversarial rewards. To this end, we rank all arms according to their indices in a non-increasing order, and activate the set of $B$ highest indexed arms at each decision epoch $h$. All remaining arms are kept passive at decision epoch $h$. We denote the resultant RMI policy as $\\pi^{t}:=\\{\\pi_{n}^{t}, \\forall n\\}$, and execute it in episode $t$.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:asympt_opt}\nThe RMI policy is asymptotically optimal when both the number of arms and instantaneous activation constraint are enlarged by $\\rho$ times with $\\rho\\rightarrow\\infty$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Analysis}\n\nIn this section, we bound the regret of our \\ucarmab.\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:regret}\nWith probability at least $1-3\\epsilon$, the regret of \\ucarmab with $\\eta=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln(|\\cS|^2|\\cA|)}{T}}$ satisfies \n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:regret_thm}\n&\\Delta(T)={\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}}\\Bigg(NH\\sqrt{T\\ln(|\\cS|^2|\\cA|)}\\nonumber\\\\\n&+H\\sqrt{2NT\\ln\\frac{4|\\cS||\\cA|NT}{\\epsilon}}\\!+\\!B\\sqrt{|\\cS||\\cA|NTH}\\Bigg).\n\\end{align}\n\\end{theorem}\n\nThe regret in \\eqref{eq:regret_thm} contains three terms. The first term is the regret due to the OMD online optimization for occupancy measure updates (Section~\\ref{sec:OMD}). The second term represents the regret due to bandit-feedback of adversarial rewards (Section~\\ref{sec:estimator}). The third term comes from the implementation of our RMI policy for \\armab (to satisfy the instantaneous activation constraint,  Section~\\ref{sec:index}). Clearly, the regret of \\ucarmab is in the order of $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$. This is the same as that for adversarial MDP \\citep{rosenberg2019online, jin2020learning} and CMDP \\citep{qiu2020upper}. However, none of them consider an instantaneous activation constraint as in our \\armab, which requires us to design a low-complexity index policy, and explicitly characterize its impact on the regret.  Although our regret bound exhibits a gap (i.e., $\\sqrt{H}$ times larger) to that of stochastic RMAB \\citep{xiong2022AAAI, xiong2022Neurips}, to the best of our knowledge, our result is the first to achieve $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. Recall that comparing to the stochastic RMAB, we are considering a harder problem with a challenging setting, i.e., the rewards can change arbitrarily between episodes rather than following a fixed distribution, and with bandit feedback where only the adversarial reward of visited state-action pairs are revealed to the DM. This challenging setting thus requires us to design a novel adversarial reward estimator coupled with the OMD online optimization procedure. \n\\subsection{Proof Sketch}\nAs discussed earlier, \\armab~(\\ref{eq:orginal_P}) is computationally intractable, and hence we cannot directly solve it and transform the regret minimization in~(\\ref{eq:regret}) into an online linear optimization problem. This makes existing regret analysis for adversarial MDP  \\citep{rosenberg2019online, jin2020learning} and CMDP \\citep{qiu2020upper} not directly applicable to ours, and necessitates different proof techniques.  To address this challenge and inspired by stochastic RMAB \\citep{xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips}, we instead work on the relaxed problem~(\\ref{eq:relaxed_constraint}), which achieves a provably upper bound on the adversarial rewards of \\armab~(\\ref{eq:orginal_P}).  In other words, the occupancy measure-based solutions to~(\\ref{eq:relaxed_constraint}) provide an upper bound of the optimal adversarial reward $R( T, \\pi^{opt})$ achieved by the offline optimal policy $\\pi^{opt}$ of \\armab \\eqref{eq:orginal_P}. We state this result formally in the following lemma. \n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:upperbound}\nThere exists a set of occupancy measures $\\mu_{\\pi}^*:=\\{\\mu^*_n(s,a;h), \\forall n\\in[N], s\\in\\cS, a\\in\\cA, h\\in[h]\\}$ under policy $\\pi^*$  that optimally solve the equivalent LP of the relaxed problem~(\\ref{eq:relaxed_constraint}). In addition, $\\sum_{t=1}^T \\langle{\\mu_\\pi^*}, r^t\\rangle$ is no less than $R( T, \\pi^{opt})$, where $r^t:=\\{r_n^t(s,a), \\forall n, s, a\\}$. \n\\end{lemma}\n\nThe proof of Theorem~\\ref{thm:regret} then starts with a regret decomposition. Unlike stochastic RMAB \\citep{xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips}, we cannot simply decompose the regret over episodes. This is because in our \\armab, the adversarial rewards can change arbitrarily between episodes, and the offline optimal policy $\\pi^{opt}$ is only optimal when it is defined over all $T$ episodes and it is not guaranteed to be optimal in each episode (see Section~\\ref{sec:model}). As a result, the regret analysis for stochastic RMAB \\citep{xiong2022AAAI,xiong2022Neurips} is not applicable to ours. To address this challenge, we instead decompose the regret in terms of its coming sources.  Specifically, we first need to characterize the regret due to solving the relaxed problem with OMD in terms of occupancy measure (Section~\\ref{sec:OMD}). We then bound the regret due to the biased overestimated reward estimator (Section~\\ref{sec:estimator}). Finally, we bound the regret of implementing our RMI policy (Section~\\ref{sec:index}). We visualize these three steps in Figure \\ref{fig:Flowchart} and provide a proof sketch herein. Combining them together gives rise to our main theoretical results in Theorem~\\ref{thm:regret}.  \n\n\n\\textbf{Regret decomposition.} We formally state our regret decomposition in the following lemma.  \n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lemma:regret_decomp}\n{Denote $\\pi^{*}$ as the optimal policy  to equivalent LP of the relaxed problem~(\\ref{eq:relaxed_constraint}) and $\\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}$ are polices executed on the MDPs at each episode with transition kernels selected from the confidence set defined in \\eqref{eq:confidence_ball}.}\nLet $R(T, \\pi^{*}, \\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\})$ be the total adversarial rewards achieved by policy $\\pi^*$ with overestimated rewards $\\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\}$. Denote \n$R(T, \\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}, \\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\})$ and  $R( T, \\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}, \\{r_n^t, \\forall n, t\\})$ as the total adversarial rewards achieved by policy $\\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}$ with overestimated rewards $\\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\}$ and true reward $\\{{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\}$, respectively.\nThe regret in \\eqref{eq:regret} can be upper bounded as\n\\begin{align}\\label{eq:lemma2}\n    &\\Delta(T)\\!\\leq {\\underset{Term_0\\leq 0}{\\underbrace{R(T, \\pi^{opt})-R( T, \\pi^{*}, \\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\}), \\forall n, t\\})}}}\\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\\n    &+\\underset{Term_1}{\\underbrace{R( T, \\pi^{*}, \\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\})\\!-\\!R( T, \\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}, \\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n, t\\})}}\\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\\n    &+\\!\\underset{Term_2}{\\underbrace{R( T, \\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}, \\{\\hat{r}_n^t, \\forall n,t\\})\\!-\\!R( T, \\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}, \\{{r}_n^t, \\forall n,t\\})}}\\nonumber\\allowdisplaybreaks\\\\\n    &+\\underset{Term_3}{\\underbrace{R( T, \\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}, \\{{r}_n^t, \\forall n,t\\})-\\sum_{t=1}^T R_t(\\pi^t)}}. \\allowdisplaybreaks\n\\end{align}\n\\end{lemma}\n\n\n Specifically, $Term_0\\leq 0$ holds  due to Lemma \\ref{lem:upperbound} and the overestimation of adversarial rewards.  $Term_1$ is the performance gap between the optimal policy $\\pi^*$ of the relaxed problem~\\eqref{eq:relaxed_constraint} and the OMD updated policy $\\{\\tilde{\\pi}^{t}, \\forall t\\}$ under the plausible MDP selected from the confidence set in \\eqref{eq:confidence_ball}. Since we leverage the OMD to update the occupancy measures, to bound $Term_1$, the key is to connect items in $Term_1$ with the occupancy measure, which leverages the result in Lemma \\ref{lem:upperbound}. $Term_2$ is the regret due to the overestimation of the adversarial reward estimator, i.e., $\\hat{r}_n^t\\geq r_n^t, \\forall n, t$.  $Term_3$ is the performance gap between the policy $\\{\\tilde{\\pi}^t, \\forall t\\}$ in the optimistic plausible MDP and the learned RMI index policy $\\{\\pi^t, \\forall t\\}$ for the true MDP. We bound it based on the count of visits of each state-action pair. \n\n\\textbf{Bounding $Term_1$.} We first bound $Term_1$, i.e., the regret due to OMD online optimization.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:term1}\nWith probability $1-2\\epsilon$, \nwe have $Term_1\\leq \\frac{NH\\ln(|\\cS|^2|\\cA|)}{\\eta}+\\eta{NH(T+1)}.$\n\\end{lemma}\n\nBounding $Term_1$ is equivalent to bound the inner product $\\sum_{t=1}^T\\sum_{n=1}^N\\langle \\mu_n^* - z_n^t, \\hat{r}_n^t \\rangle$, with $z_n^t, \\forall n \\in[N]$ being controlled by the OMD updates, a proper $\\eta$ (as given in Theorem~\\ref{thm:regret}) is required to guarantee $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(H\\sqrt{T})$ regret. \n\\textbf{Bounding $Term_2$.} We then bound $Term_2$, i.e., the regret due to bandit-feedback adversarial reward.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:term2}\nWith probability $1-3\\epsilon$, we have $Term_2\\leq H\\sqrt{2NT\\ln\\frac{4|\\cS||\\cA|NT}{\\epsilon}}+HN\\sqrt{NT\\ln \\frac{1}{\\epsilon}}.$\nBounding $Term_2$ requires us to bound the inner product\n$\\sum_{t=1}^T\\sum_{n=1}^N\\langle  z_n^t, \\hat{r}_n^t-r_n^t \\rangle$, which is dominated by the gap of $\\hat{r}_n^t-r_n^t$. An overestimation can guarantee that $\\langle  z_n^t, \\hat{r}_n^t-r_n^t \\rangle\\geq 0, \\forall n\\in[N], t\\in[T].$\n\\textbf{Bounding $Term_3$.} Finally, we bound $Term_3$, i.e., the regret due to RMI index policy. \n \n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:term3}\nWith probability $1-2\\epsilon$,  we have $Term_3\\leq\\Big(\\sqrt{2\\ln\\frac{4|\\cS||\\cA|NTH}{\\epsilon}}+2B\\Big)\\sqrt{|\\cS||\\cA|NTH}.$\nSince the adversarial rewards (i.e., $\\hat{r}_n^t$) do not impact $Term_3$, we decompose  $Term_3$ into each episode.  The key  is to characterize the number of visits of each state-action pair, which is related to the instantaneous activation constraint $B$ and has a $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(B\\sqrt{TH})$ regret.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{minipage}{.24\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{AdversarialReward.pdf}\n\\subcaption{Accumulated Reward.}\n \\label{fig:reward}\n\\end{minipage}\\hfill\n\\begin{minipage}{.24\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{AdversarialRegret.pdf}\n\\subcaption{Accumulated Regret.}\n \\label{fig:regret}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{The learning performance comparison for case study-CPAP.}\n        \\label{fig:examples}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering\n\\begin{minipage}{.24\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{Casestudy_reward.pdf}\n\\subcaption{Accumulated reward.}\n \\label{fig:reward2}\n\\end{minipage}\\hfill\n\\begin{minipage}{.24\\textwidth}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{Casestudy_regret.pdf}\n\\subcaption{Accumulated regret.}\n \\label{fig:regret2}\n\\end{minipage}\n\\caption{The learning performance comparison for case study-A Deadline Scheduling Problem.}\n        \\label{fig:examples2}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\section{Numerical Study}\n\nIn this section, we demonstrate the utility of \\ucarmab by evaluating it under two real-world applications of RMAB in the presence of adversarial rewards, i.e., the continuous positive airway pressure therapy (CPAP)  \\citep{kang2013markov,herlihy2023planning,li2022towards, wang2024online} and a deadline scheduling problem \\cite{xiong2022AAAI}.\n\nWe compare our \\ucarmab with a benchmark named RMAB-UCRL \\cite{xiong2022Neurips}, which was developed for stochastic RMAB, in terms of accumulated rewards and accumulated regret.

Specifically, RLU estimates labels by solving a least-square problem that emerges from the analysis of the correlation between labels of the data points used in a training round and the resulting update of the output layer. The experimental results on several datasets, architectures, and data heterogeneity scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and helps improve quality of the reconstructed images in GI attacks in terms of both PSNR and LPIPS.\n",

Meanwhile, the concept of mixed-precision quantization (MPQ), where different layers of a deep learning model are assigned varying bit-width, remains unexplored in the FL settings. We present a novel FL algorithm, FedMPQ, which introduces mixed-precision quantization to resource-heterogeneous FL systems. Specifically, local models, quantized so as to satisfy bit-width constraint, are trained by optimizing an objective function that includes a regularization term which promotes reduction of precision in some of the layers without significant performance degradation. The server collects local model updates, de-quantizes them into full-precision models, and then aggregates them into a global model. To initialize the next round of local training, the server relies on the information learned in the previous training round to customize bit-width assignments of the models delivered to different clients. In extensive benchmarking experiments on several model architectures and different datasets in both iid and non-iid settings, FedMPQ outperformed the baseline FL schemes that utilize fixed-precision quantization while incurring only a minor computational overhead on the participating devices."

The success of the proposed method is contingent on constructing an over-parameterized convolutional network, so that images are generated before fitting to the gradient matching requirement. Practical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves high-fidelity image recovery, surpassing state-of-the-art competitors that commonly fail in more intricate scenarios.

                "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising distributed machine learning framework to preserve clients' privacy, by allowing multiple clients to upload the gradients calculated from their local data to a central server. Recent studies find that the exchanged gradients also take the risk of privacy leakage, e.g., an attacker can invert the shared gradients and recover sensitive data against an FL system by leveraging pre-trained generative adversarial networks (GAN) as prior knowledge. However, performing gradient inversion attacks in the latent space of the GAN model limits their expression ability and generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Gradient Inversion over Feature Domains (GIFD), which disassembles the GAN model and searches the feature domains of the intermediate layers. Instead of optimizing only over the initial latent code, we progressively change the optimized layer, from the initial latent space to intermediate layers closer to the output images. In addition, we design a regularizer to avoid unreal image generation by adding a small l1 ball constraint to the searching range. We also extend GIFD to the out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, which weakens the assumption that the training sets of GANs and FL tasks obey the same data distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve pixel-level reconstruction and is superior to the existing methods.

We propose FedHKD (Federated Hyper-Knowledge Distillation), a novel FL algorithm in which clients rely on knowledge distillation (KD) to train local models. In particular, each client extracts and sends to the server the means of local data representations and the corresponding soft predictions -- information that we refer to as ``hyper-knowledge\". The server aggregates this information and broadcasts it to the clients in support of local training. Notably, unlike other KD-based pFL methods, FedHKD does not rely on a public dataset nor it deploys a generative model at the server. We analyze convergence of FedHKD and conduct extensive experiments on visual datasets in a variety of scenarios, demonstrating that FedHKD provides significant improvement in both personalized as well as global model performance compared to state-of-the-art FL methods designed for heterogeneous data settings."

In this paper we propose FedDPMS (Federated Differentially Private Means Sharing), an FL algorithm in which clients augment local datasets with data synthesized using differentially private information collected and communicated by a trusted server. In particular, the server matches the pairs of clients having complementary local datasets and facilitates differentially-private sharing of the means of latent data representations; the clients then deploy variational auto-encoders to enrich their datasets and thus ameliorate the effects of non-iid data distribution.

This on-the-fly reconstruction attack deserves to be studied in depth because it can occur at any stage of training, whether at the beginning or at the end of model training; no relevant dataset is required and no additional models need to be trained. We break through some unrealistic assumptions and limitations to apply this reconstruction attack in a broader range of scenarios. We propose methods that can reconstruct the training data from shared gradients or weights, corresponding to the FedSGD and FedAvg usage scenarios, respectively. We propose a zero-shot approach to restore labels even if there are duplicate labels in the batch. We study the relationship between the label and image restoration. We find that image restoration fails even if there is only one incorrectly inferred label in the batch; we also find that when batch images have the same label, the corresponding image is restored as a fusion of that class of images. Our approaches are evaluated on classic image benchmarks, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. The batch size, image quality, and the adaptability of the label distribution of our approach exceed those of GradInversion, the state-of-the-art."

In contrast to the common belief that this provides privacy benefits, we here add to the very recent results on privacy risks when sharing gradients. Specifically, we investigate Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG), a novel attack to extract the labels of the users’ training data from their shared gradients. The attack exploits the direction and magnitude of gradients to determine the presence or absence of any label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of leaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well to arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We mathematically and empirically demonstrate the validity of the attack under different settings. Moreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with high accuracy at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different defense mechanisms against such leakage. Our findings suggest that gradient compression is a practical technique to mitigate the attack."

                "abstract": "Training deep neural networks requires gradient estimation from data batches to update parameters. Gradients per parameter are averaged over a set of data and this has been presumed to be safe for privacy-preserving training in joint, collaborative, and federated learning applications. Prior work only showed the possibility of recovering input data given gradients under very restrictive conditions – a single input point, or a network with no non-linearities, or a small 32 × 32 px input batch. Therefore, averaging gradients over larger batches was thought to be safe. In this work, we introduce GradInversion, using which input images from a larger batch (8 – 48 images) can also be recovered for large networks such as ResNets (50 layers), on complex datasets such as ImageNet (1000 classes, 224 × 224 px). We formulate an optimization task that converts random noise into natural images, matching gradients while regularizing image fidelity. We also propose an algorithm for target class label recovery given gradients. We further propose a group consistency regularization framework, where multiple agents starting from different random seeds work together to find an enhanced reconstruction of the original data batch. We show that gradients encode a surprisingly large amount of information, such that all the individual images can be recovered with high fidelity via GradInversion, even for complex datasets, deep networks, and large batch sizes."

Each user receives the current weights of the network and in turns sends parameter updates (gradients) based on local data. This protocol has been designed not only to train neural networks data-efficiently, but also to provide privacy benefits for users, as their input data remains on device and only parameter gradients are shared. But how secure is sharing parameter gradients? Previous attacks have provided a false sense of security, by succeeding only in contrived settings - even for a single image. However, by exploiting a magnitude-invariant loss along with optimization strategies based on adversarial attacks, we show that is is actually possible to faithfully reconstruct images at high resolution from the knowledge of their parameter gradients, and demonstrate that such a break of privacy is possible even for trained deep networks. We analyze the effects of architecture as well as parameters on the difficulty of reconstructing an input image and prove that any input to a fully connected layer can be reconstructed analytically independent of the remaining architecture. Finally we discuss settings encountered in practice and show that even averaging gradients over several iterations or several images does not protect the user's privacy in federated learning applications in computer vision."

In their Deep Leakage from Gradient (DLG) method, they synthesize the dummy data and corresponding labels with the supervision of shared gradients. However, DLG has difficulty in convergence and discovering the ground-truth labels consistently. In this paper, we find that sharing gradients definitely leaks the ground-truth labels. We propose a simple but reliable approach to extract accurate data from the gradients. Particularly, our approach can certainly extract the ground-truth labels as opposed to DLG, hence we name it Improved DLG (iDLG). Our approach is valid for any differentiable model trained with cross-entropy loss over one-hot labels. We mathematically illustrate how our method can extract ground-truth labels from the gradients and empirically demonstrate the advantages over DLG."

We prove that SCAFFOLD requires significantly fewer communication rounds and is not affected by data heterogeneity or client sampling. Further, we show that (for quadratics) SCAFFOLD can take advantage of similarity in the client's data yielding even faster convergence.

In this work, we introduce a framework, FedProx, to tackle heterogeneity in federated networks. FedProx can be viewed as a generalization and re-parametrization of FedAvg, the current state-of-the-art method for federated learning. While this re-parameterization makes only minor modifications to the method itself, these modifications have important ramifications both in theory and in practice. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for our framework when learning over data from non-identical distributions (statistical heterogeneity), and while adhering to device-level systems constraints by allowing each participating device to perform a variable amount of work (systems heterogeneity). Practically, we demonstrate that FedProx allows for more robust convergence than FedAvg across a suite of realistic federated datasets. In particular, in highly heterogeneous settings, FedProx demonstrates significantly more stable and accurate convergence behavior relative to FedAvg---improving absolute test accuracy by 22% on average."

First, we show that an adversarial participant can infer the presence of exact data points -- for example, specific locations -- in others' training data (i.e., membership inference). Then, we show how this adversary can infer properties that hold only for a subset of the training data and are independent of the properties that the joint model aims to capture. For example, he can infer when a specific person first appears in the photos used to train a binary gender classifier.

Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called \"perceptual losses\"? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations."

However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are \"scaled exponential linear units\" (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep. Implementations are available at: this http URL."

Since the values of metrics depend not only on the models, but also on the data, it may turn out that different models are the best on different test sets. For this reason, the traditional approach to comparing the values of metrics on a test set is often not enough. Sometimes a statistical comparison of the results obtained on the basis of cross-validation is used, but in this case it is impossible to guarantee the independence of the obtained measurements, which does not allow the use of the Student's t-test. There are criteria that do not require independent measurements, but they have less power. For additive metrics, a technique is proposed in this paper, when a test sample is divided into N parts, on each of which the values of the metrics are calculated. Since the value on each part is obtained as the sum of independent random variables, according to the central limit theorem, the obtained metrics values on each of the N parts are realizations of the normally distributed random variable. To estimate the required sample size, it is proposed to use normality tests and build quantile– quantile plots. You can then use a modification of the Student's t-test to conduct a statistical test comparing the mean values of the metrics. A simplified approach is also considered, in which confidence intervals are built for the base model. A model whose metric values do not fall into this interval works differently from the base model. This approach reduces the amount of computations needed, however, an experimental analysis of the binary cross-entropy metric for CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction models showed that it is more rough than the first one."

Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10% classification error for a single crop, single model network."

We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering.

                "abstract": "Detecting and reading text from natural images is a hard computer vision task that is central to a variety of emerging applications. Related problems like document character recognition have been widely studied by computer vision and machine learning researchers and are virtually solved for practical applications like reading handwritten digits. Reliably recognizing characters in more complex scenes like photographs, however, is far more difficult: the best existing methods lag well behind human performance on the same tasks. In this paper we attack the problem of recognizing digits in a real application using unsupervised feature learning methods: reading house numbers from street level photos. To this end, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for research use containing over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from Street View images. We then demonstrate the difficulty of recognizing these digits when the problem is approached with hand-designed features. Finally, we employ variants of two recently proposed unsupervised feature learning methods and find that they are convincingly superior on our benchmarks."

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day."

                "\n\n\\label{introduction}\n\nFederated learning (FL) \\citep{fedavg}, which aims to enable collaborative training of ML models while protecting privacy of the participating clients, has attracted considerable interest in privacy-sensitive fields such as healthcare and finance \\citep{yangqiang}. However, recent works have demonstrated vulnerability of FL systems to privacy attacks such as membership inference \\citep{membership}, property inference \\citep{property} and gradient inversion \\citep{dlg}. In particular, gradient inversion methods have been shown capable of reconstructing private training data given the gradients computed during local training. The milestone work, Deep Leakage from Gradient (DLG) \\citep{dlg}, minimizes the difference between simulated and true gradients to extract data and the corresponding labels belonging to FL clients training a model for a classification task. \nHowever, DLG does not perform well in settings where the training batch size is large and the data resolution is high, since in such scenarios the joint optimization of data and the corresponding labels becomes challenging. A subsequent study, iDLG \\citep{idlg}, presents an analytical method for the recovery of ground-truth labels from the gradients by exploiting a relationship between the labels and the signs of the gradients. \nGradInversion \\citep{yin} takes a step further by exploiting a relationship between labels and the magnitudes of gradient in the output layer to perfectly restore labels of the samples used in the considered training round, and facilitates high-resolution reconstruction of data in a batch with as many as 48 samples. Unfortunately, this method assumes no repeated labels in the batch, which is unrealistic in real-world settings. Recently, iRLG \\citep{irlg} attempted to address the limitations of GradInversion, enabling recovery of potentially repeated labels in a batch by utilizing gradients computed using a randomly initialized untrained model. However, the performance of iRLG drastically deteriorates as the model's accuracy improves. \n\nThe above label recovery methods either: (1) assume no repeated labels in a batch; (2) use non-negative network activation functions; or (3) perform well only on untrained models. They further assume that each client in an FL system runs only a single epoch when updating its local model, while the more practical settings with multiple epochs of local training are not considered. Moreover, these studies are limited to the scenarios where a server collects gradients\nand do not apply to the standard FL setting where\nthe server collects model updates rather than the gradients.\n\nAiming to address the aforementioned limitations of the prior work, in this paper we propose a novel method for label recovery, \\underline{R}ecovering \\underline{L}abels from Local \\underline{U}pdates (RLU). We start by analyzing correlations between local updates of the output layer and the ground-truth labels of data samples in training batches for several frequently used FL algorithms. These correlations, along with the expected value of the ``erroneous confidence\" (i.e., the level of confidence when making erroneous decisions) evaluated on a small auxiliary dataset, are then used to recover the labels. As local training unfolds across multiple epochs, distribution of the previously mentioned ``erroneous confidence\" undergoes changes which the server cannot access. Simulating an underlying dynamical model helps estimate how this distribution evolves across training epochs; the obtained estimates of intermediate distributions are then utilized to help achieve notable enhancement in the accuracy of label recovery. The effectiveness of RLU is demonstrated in extensive experiments involving several FL algorithms and various model architectures on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets. In all the considered settings, RLU outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both untrained and well-trained models. The main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item We propose a general analytical method that enables the server in an FL system to recover labels of the points used by clients in local training; the proposed method applies to various FL algorithms and makes no assumptions regarding the activation function or batch label composition.\n\n\\item To allow accurate label recovery in FL systems where clients train across multiple epochs, we simulate the evolution of the model through the epochs via a Monte Carlo method that updates the ``erroneous confidence\" characterizing the correlation between local updates and training data labels.\n\n\\item To evaluate the proposed label recovery method, we conduct comprehensive benchmarking experiments across a number of FL settings where we vary the level of data heterogeneity, model architectures and local objective functions. \n\\end{itemize}\n\n"

The classical FL algorithm, FedAvg \\citep{fedavg}, enables $K$ clients to collaboratively train global model without sharing their private data $\\mathcal{D}_{k}$. In FedAvg, the server initializes training round $t$ by broadcasting global model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$ to the clients. Client $k$ updates its local model by running a gradient descent procedure on its (private) local data; the server then collects updated local models $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k}$ from the clients and averages them to form a new global model,\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t+1)} = \\sum_{k=1}^{K}p_{k}\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $p_{k}$ denotes the weight assigned to client $k$. Since the training is initialized by broadcasting global model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$ to the clients, local updates are computed as $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k} = \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k} - \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$. It is worth pointing out that in FL algorithms other than FedAvg, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k}$ is not necessarily proportional to the gradients $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k}$. We discuss properties of local updates in Section \\ref{beyond_fedavg}.\n\n\\textbf{Gradients Inversion Attack}. DLG \\citep{dlg} is the first optimization-based method for reconstructing training data given the gradients $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ and model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. More specifically, DLG minimizes the difference between simulated and ground-truth gradients,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{ig}\n    \\mathbf{x}^{\\star}, \\mathbf{y}^{\\star} = \\text{arg}\\min_{\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}, \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime}} \\left\\Vert \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{task}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}, \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime}) - \\nabla \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\right\\Vert^{2}.\n\\end{equation}\nFollow-up studies \\citep{geiping, yin} introduced total variation and group consistency regularization to the objective of the gradient inversion optimization, enabling high reconstruction performance on ImageNet \\citep{imagenet}. Recently, a number of works \\citep{generative,gifd,overparameter} leveraged pre-trained generative models to improve the gradient inversion attack and achieve state-of-the-art performance with batch size set to $32$. However, these schemes assume knowing the ground-truth labels $\\mathbf{y}$ in the batch -- an unrealistic assumption that significantly accelerates the search for the optimal data $\\mathbf{x}^{\\star}$.\n\\textbf{Label Recovery Attack}. To improve the performance of an attack on gradients computed using samples coming from a relatively large batch, a series of studies \\citep{idlg,yin,rlg,llg,zlg, irlg} proposed various analytical approaches to recovering labels $\\mathbf{y}$ prior to solving the optimization over $\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}$. However, all these methods suffer limitations that restrict their practical feasibility. GradInversion \\citep{yin} assumes there are no repeated labels in a batch; RLG \\citep{rlg} can only recover class-wise labels but not instance-wise labels; LLG \\citep{llg} and ZLG \\citep{zlg} require non-negative activation functions; iRLG \\citep{irlg} performs well only on randomly initialized untrained models. \nMoreover, these methods primarily focus on FedAvg and generally provide little if any discussion of other FL algorithms.\n\n"

The HBC server knows the batch size, number of local epochs and learning rate used by the clients but has no information about local data distribution. We assume each local model is trained by minimizing the cross-entropy (CE) loss \n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{celoss}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ce}} = -\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\sum_{i = 1}^{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\log\\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{q}_{y^{(i)}}^{(i)})}{\\sum_{n = 1}^{N} \\exp(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{(i)})}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{B}$ denotes a training batch; $(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ is the $i$-th example in the batch; $N$ is the number of classes; and $\\mathbf{q}^{(i)} = \\mathbf{W} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}^{(i)} + \\mathbf{b}$ denotes the output logits of the model given the embedding $\\mathbf{e}^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}$ of $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$, where $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times L}$ and $\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ are the weights and bias of the output layer.\n\n\\subsection{ Label Recovery from Local Updates (RLU)}\n\\label{charateristic}\nFollowing the definition of the CE loss in Eq\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\nabla\\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(i)} = \\left\\{\n    \\begin{aligned}\n        & \\;\\;\\;\\; \\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{q}_{j}^{(i)})}{\\sum_{n = 1}^{N} \\exp(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{(i)})} = \\mathbf{s}_{j}(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), \\text{ if } j \\not = y^{(i)}, \\\\\n        & -\\frac{\\sum_{n \\not = j}\\exp(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{(i)})}{\\sum_{n = 1}^{N} \\exp(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{(i)})}, \\text{ if } j  = y^{(i)}.\\\\\n    \\end{aligned}\n    \\right.\n\\end{equation}\nAssuming stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer, the local update of the $j$-th component of the output layer's bias computed by client $k$ is \n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{local_update}\n     \\Delta\\mathbf{b}_{j} = -\\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}^{\\tau}|}\\sum_{\\tau = 1}^{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\nabla\\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(i,\\tau)}, \\mathcal{B}^{\\tau}\\sim \\mathcal{D}_{k}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\tau$ is the local epoch index, $m$ is the number of epochs, $\\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\\mathcal{D}_{k}$ denotes client $k$'s data. Note that $\\mathbf{s}_{j}(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) \\in (0,1)$ can be interpreted as the ``erroneous confidence\" of labeling $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ as class $j$ while $j \\not = y^{(i)}$ (i.e., confidence in a labeling decision that is in fact erroneous). Let $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}$ denote the expected erroneous confidence for class $j$ given a sample with true label $n \\not = j$,\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{S}_{n,j} = \\mathbb{E}_{(\\mathbf{x}, y)\\sim \\mathcal{D}_{k}^{(n)}}\\left[ \\mathbf{s}_{j}(\\mathbf{x})\\right], \\forall n,j \\in [N] \\wedge n \\not = j,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}_{k}^{(n)} \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}_{k}$ collects samples with label $n$ and $(\\mathbf{x}, y)$ is a random sample from $\\mathcal{D}_{k}^{(n)}$. These expectations are indicative of the model's training error: $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j} \\approx \\frac{1}{N}$ in a randomly initialized untrained model making random predictions, whereas $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}$ asymptotically goes to $0$ as the accuracy of the model increases.\n\nNote that the expected erroneous confidence, $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}$ does not admit closed-form expression; to analyze it and gain needed insight, we make the following assumption.\n\\begin{assumption} \n\\label{assumption_1}\nThe output logits $\\mathbf{q}^{(n)}$ of model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ when the input is $\\mathbf{x} \\sim \\mathcal{D}^{(n)}$ follows a multivariate normal distribution, i.e.,\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbf{q}^{(n)} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{n}),\n\\label{assume31}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n}$ and covariance $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{n}$ depend on the accuracy of the model. \n\\end{assumption}\n\nFor an untrained deep model whose parameters are initialized from a zero-mean uniform distribution, expected values of the output logits $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{1}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{N}$ are approximately $\\mathbf{0}$. As the accuracy of the model improves during the training process, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{j,j}$ converges to a positive value while $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n,j} (n \\not= j)$ converges to a negative value, forcing $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}$ to converge to $0$. The existing methods that perform well only on untrained models operate under the assumption $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n} = \\mathbf{0}$, which does not hold for well-trained models. Experimental results that empirically verify Assumption~3.\n\nIn each global round of training, the server leverages global model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$ to obtain estimates of the parameters in (\\ref{assume31}), $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}$ and $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{n}$, via a Monte Carlo method run on a small auxiliary dataset $\\mathcal{A}$: the samples from $\\mathcal{A}$ are processed by $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$ and the resulting output logits are used to empirically compute the mean and variance. Given the estimates of the parameters, the server samples $M$ data points $ \\mathbf{q}^{(n,i)} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}, \\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{n})$ to infer $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}$ as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{monte_carlo}\n    \\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{n,j} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^{M}\\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{q}^{(n,i)}_{j})}{\\sum_{c=1}^{N}\\exp (\\mathbf{q}_{c}^{(n,i)})}.\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsubsection{Single Epoch Local Training}\nWhen $m = 1$, we omit superscript $\\tau$ and let\n$\\Delta\\mathbf{b}_{j} = -\\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\nabla\\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(i)}$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq_b}\n    \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Delta\\mathbf{b}_{j}\\right] = \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\left(N_{j}\\sum_{n \\not= j} \\mathcal{S}_{j,n} - \\sum_{n \\not = j} N_{n}\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}\\right),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $N_{j}$ denotes the number of samples in $\\mathcal{B}$ with label $j$. Finally, $N_{j}$ is estimated by solving  \n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{minimization}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\min_{\\mathbf{z}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}} \\left\\Vert \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{z} -  \\mathbf{u}\\right\\Vert^{2}_{2} \\\\\n\\text{s.t.}\\quad & \\mathbf{0} \\leq \\mathbf{z} \\leq  \\mathbf{1} \\wedge \\left\\Vert\\mathbf{z}\\right\\Vert_{1} = 1,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{u} = \\Delta \\mathbf{b}/\\eta$, the diagonal entries of the coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ are $a_{j,j} = \\sum_{n\\not = j} \\mathcal{S}_{j,n}$, and the $(n,j)$ off-diagonal entry of $\\mathbf{A}$ is $a_{n,j} = -\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}$. After finding the solution $\\mathbf{z}^{\\star}$ to the above problem, we estimate $N_{j}$ as $\\bar{N}_{j} = \\lfloor|\\mathcal{B}|\\cdot \\mathbf{z}^{\\star}_{j}\\rceil$.\n\\subsubsection{Multiple Epochs of Local Training}\n\\label{multiple_epochs}\nTo reduce communication bandwidth, clients in FL typically update their local models over multiple epochs (with multiple batches of data), as illustrated in Eq.~\\ref{local_update}. Assume fixed learning rate $\\eta$ and constant batch size across all epochs (i.e., $|\\mathcal{B}^{\\tau}| = |\\mathcal{B}|$ for all $\\tau$); then the expectation of the local update $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Delta\\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(t)}\\right]$ in global round $t$ can be found as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq_b_multi}\n      \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\sum_{\\tau = 1}^{m}\\left(N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\sum_{n \\not = j} \\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,\\tau)} - \\sum_{n \\not = j} N_{n}^{(t,\\tau)}\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\right),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}$ is the number of samples with label $j$ in epoch $\\tau$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}$ denotes the expected erroneous confidence of local model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{(t,\\tau-1)}$ on class $j$. At the beginning of local training, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t,0)}_{k}$ is initialized with the global model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$. Note that $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,1)}$ can be estimated using global model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$ while $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,m+1)}$ is readily inferred using the collected local model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t,m)}_{k}$ via previously described Monte Carlo procedure. However, the intermediate states $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,2)},\\dots, \\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,m)}$ are unknown since the server does not have access to local models $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{(t,1)},\\dots,\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{(t,m-1)}$. Since the evolution of $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}$ is \nnon-linear, trivial interpolation between $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,1)}$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ may be highly inaccurate. To this end, we propose a practical method that relies on dynamics of the model parameter updates to approximate $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,\\tau)}$ in the intermediate epochs. Suppose we know $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,\\tau)}$ and the numbers of samples with different labels \n$N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}$, $j \\in [N]$. Then \n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{update_of_bias}\n    \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Delta \\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\right] = \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\left(N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\sum_{n \\not= j} \\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,\\tau)} - \\sum_{n \\not = j} N_{n}^{(t,\\tau)}\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\right).\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{use_signal_to_update}\n    \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Delta \\mathbf{q}_{j}^{(n)}\\right] = \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)} = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Delta \\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\right]  \\cdot \\sum_{l=1}^{L}\\bar{\\mathbf{e}}_{l}^{2},\n\\end{equation}\nand then obtain $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau+1)} = \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)} + \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}$. Using $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau+1)}$ in the next local epoch, \none can estimate $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau+1)}$ according to Eq. \\ref{monte_carlo}. By recursively conducting the above procedure, one can estimate all the intermediate states $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}$. However, $N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}$ and $\\bar{\\mathbf{e}}_{l}$ are not known -- only the average updates of weight $\\Delta \\mathbf{W}_{j,l}^{(t)}$ and bias $\\Delta \\mathbf{b}_{j}^{t}$ are given. A closer examination of the correlation between $\\nabla  \\mathbf{W}_{j,l}^{(t)}$ and $\\nabla \\mathbf{b}_{j}^{t}$ suggests estimating the average embedded\nsignal according to\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{expectation_of_bias_multiple}\n    \\bar{\\mathbf{e}}_{l} \\approx \\Delta \\mathbf{W}_{j,l}^{(t)} / \\Delta \\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(t)}.\n\\end{equation}\nTo estimate the total number $\\{\\bar{N}_{j}^{(t)}\\}_{j=1}^{N}$ of labels in $m$ sampled batches we first set $N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)} = \\mathbf{g}_{j}$, where $\\mathbf{g}\\in \\mathbb{N}^{N}$ denotes an arbitrarily vector (a guess) satisfying $\\left\\Vert \\mathbf{g}\\right\\Vert_{1} = |\\mathcal{B}|$. As described earlier in this subsection, if we knew $N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}$ we could dynamically update $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,\\tau)}$ to arrive at $\\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$. Since the true $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ is known by the server (collected after the final epoch), the difference between $\\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ could be used to adjust $\\mathbf{g}_{j}$ and subsequently improve the estimate $\\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$. If $\\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ is significantly smaller than $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$, $\\mathbf{g}_{j}$ was underestimated; otherwise, $\\mathbf{g}_{j}$ was overestimated. Intuitively, local model tends to label input data as class $j$ if the samples with label $j$ are dominant in the batches sampled for training.\n\nAfter a number of iterations, the difference between $\\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ becomes small and $m \\cdot \\mathbf{g}_{j}$ closely approximates $N_{j}^{(t)}$. To accelerate the search for $\\mathbf{g}$, one can introduce $\\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t)} = (\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,1)} + \\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)})/2$ and solve optimization (\\ref{minimization}) parameterized by $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n} = \\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t)}$ to obtain an initial estimate $\\bar{N}_{j}^{(t)}$ which, in turn, is used to initialize $\\mathbf{g}_{j} = \\bar{N}_{j}^{(t)}/m$. In our experiments, following such an initialization RLU achieves highly accurate performance after only $T=5$ iterations.\n\n\n\\subsection{FL schemes beyond FedAvg and SGD}\n\\label{beyond_fedavg}\n\\input{src/table1}\n\nThe prior works on GI attacks in FL focused on FedAvg \\citep{fedavg}, where local training pursues minimization of the CE loss, $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ce}}$. Deterioration of the performance of FedAvg observed in non-i.i.d. settings motivated a number of studies \\citep{fedprox,scaffold,feddyn,feddc, fedhkd, feddpms, fedmpq} that address the challenge of data heterogeneity by introducing various regularization terms to the local objective function. In particular, those methods consider objectives that are combination of the empirical risk and a regularizer, i.e.,\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{local}} = \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ce}} + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{regularizer}}.\n\\end{equation}\nFor such objectives, the local updates of the bias collected by a server are not proportional to the gradients of $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ce}}$, adversely affecting the efficacy of the existing methods that attempt to recover labels from gradients. Furthermore, the existing label recovery methods assume that the local models are updated using SGD optimizers. When optimizers other than SGD are used, local updates are generally not proportional to the gradients of $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ce}}$. To explore such settings, we analyze the expectation of local updates in several milestone non-i.i.d. FL schemes and consider two well-known variants of SGD \\citep{sgd}, SGD with momentum (SGDm) and Nesterov accelerated gradient method (NAG). To accommodate these more general cases, we rephrase the expectation of the $j$-th component of the local update of bias $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Delta\\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(t)}\\right]$ in global round $t$ as\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\sum_{\\tau = 1}^{m}\\rho^{(\\tau)}\\left(N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\sum_{n\\not= j} \\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,\\tau)} - \\sum_{n \\not= j} N_{n}^{(t,\\tau)}\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\right) - \\mathbf{h}_{j}^{(t)},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\rho^{(\\tau)}$ is a constant that depends on hyper-parameters used by different methods and remains constant across global rounds, and $\\mathbf{h}_{j}^{(t)}$ is a term capturing historical training information (past local updates). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies label recovery attacks in FL schemes beyond FedAvg.\nIn FL schemes that utilize only the gradient information computed in the current global round (e.g., FedAvg and FedProx) \n$\\mathbf{h}_{j}^{t} = \\mathbf{0}$, while for the schemes that also\nrely on the past gradient information (Scaffold, FedDyn and FedDC)\n$\\mathbf{h}_{j}^{t} \\not = \\mathbf{0}$. In any case, $\\rho^{(\\tau)}$ and $\\mathbf{h}_{j}^{(t)}$ are known to the server and may potentially be used for label recovery attacks. In our work, we rely on the procedure for label recovery from local updates discussed in the previous section to run RLU attacks on different FL schemes where $\\rho^{(\\tau)}$ and $\\mathbf{h}_{j}^{t}$ vary from one scheme to another according to Table~\\ref{table1}.\n"

The auxiliary dataset $\\mathcal{A}$ contains $100$ samples per class.\n\\input{src/table2}\n\n\\subsection{Baselines and Evaluation Metrics}\n\\label{section_metrics}\nWe compare our proposed RLU to three state-of-the-art methods: LLG \\citep{llg}, ZLG \\citep{zlg} and iRLG \\citep{irlg}, all capable of recovering repeated labels in a batch. For fairness, we compare RLU to LLG+ and ZLG+; the latter two utilize the same auxiliary dataset $\\mathcal{A}$ as RLU to achieve improved performance. Following the strategy of iRLG, we quantify the performance of a label recovery attack using two metrics: (1) \\emph{class-level accuracy (cAcc)}: the proportion of correctly recovered classes; (2) \\emph{instance-level accuracy (iAcc)}: the proportion of correctly recovered labels. We recover batch labels from the local updates computed on clients' local dataset and report the average cAcc and iAcc.\n\n\\subsection{Attack on Untrained Models}\n\n\\label{untrained}\nA randomly initialized untrained model may be extremely vulnerable to label recovery attacks; for instance, if the server knows how the training is initialized, it does not even need an auxiliary data set to infer the parameters (e.g., $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n}$) used in the attack. To compare the performance of baseline methods with that of RLU, we conduct comprehensive experiments on untrained models across various architectures, datasets, batch-sizes and activation functions. The results, reported in Table~\\ref{table2}, demonstrate that RLU outperforms the baselines in all settings. When local training consists of a single epoch, RLU achieves near-perfect accuracy across the board in terms of both cAcc and iAcc; iRLG is a close second, outperforming other baselines. Since LLG+ assumes non-negative activation functions, its performance deteriorates significantly with Tanh and SELU. On Tiny-ImageNet, ZLG+ performs the worst among the four methods, achieving under $70\\%$ iAcc.\n\nWhen the clients run $m = 10$ local epochs, performance of all methods deteriorates (as expected based on the discussion in Section \\ref{multiple_epochs}). Nevertheless, the results in Table~\\ref{table2} show that RLU still outperforms the baselines, maintaining at least $84\\%$ cACC and $90\\%$ iAcc on all datasets, architectures and activation functions. While iRLG maintains solid performance on SVHN and Tiny-ImageNet, it performs significantly worse on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 (iAcc falls below $70\\%$, cAcc drops below $50\\%$). The results of LLG+ follow the same pattern exhibited in single epoch settings, while ZLG+ experiences significant performance deterioration on SVHN. For consistency and a comparison with the results in Table~\\ref{table2}, unless stated otherwise, in the remainder of this section the number of local epochs $m$ is set to $10$.\n\n\\subsection{Attack on Trained Models}\n\\label{trained}\n\\begin{figure*}[t] \n    \\centering\n\t  \\subfloat[SVHN]{\n       \\includegraphics[width=0.33\\linewidth]{images/SVHN.png}}\n\t  \\subfloat[CIFAR10]{\n        \\includegraphics[width=0.33\\linewidth]{images/CIFAR10.png}}\n\t  \\subfloat[CIFAR100]{\n        \\includegraphics[width=0.33\\linewidth]{images/CIFAR100.png}}\n\t\\caption{Instance-level accuracy of different attack methods deteriorates as training progresses. Each point on the black dashed curve indicates the training accuracy of the global model in each global round.}\n\\label{trained_models} \n\\end{figure*}\nSince the accuracy of the global model improves as the training proceeds, comparing methods in terms of attacks on untrained model becomes no longer meaningful. As discussed in Section \\ref{charateristic}, distribution of output logits depends on the accuracy of the model which is parameterized by mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n}$ and covariance $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{n}$. When the model becomes highly accurate, magnitudes of local gradients (updates) start vanishing; this, in turn, causes high sensitivity to noise and a large error in estimating the labels. All of the methods in Table~\\ref{table2} experience performance deterioration as the model accuracy increases. To compare their robustness, we conduct extensive experiments and evaluate performance of different attack methods at different stages of training. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{trained_models}, RLU outperforms the baselines at all training stages, achieving $80\\%$ iAcc when the model accuracy reaches $80\\%$. For the global model achieving $90\\%$ training accuracy, iAcc of iRLG reaches $75.6 \\%$, $83.3\\%$ and $72.6\\%$ on SVHN, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, respectively. The iAcc of ZLG+ is $33.3\\%$, $21.1\\%$ and $30.1\\%$ lower than RLU's, while iRLG's trails RLU by $16.3 \\%$, $17.3 \\%$ and $23.9 \\%$ on these three datasets, respectively. The iAcc performance of LLG+ is better than that of other prior methods but still falls significantly behind  RLU's. \n\n\\subsection{Effect of Data Heterogeneity}\n\\label{heterogeneity}\n\\input{src/table3}\n\\input{src/table4}\nData heterogeneity is one the main challenges in real-world applications of federated learning. Prior works on label reconstruction evaluated their proposed methods on i.i.d. data, but the evaluation on non-i.i.d. data has remained largely unexplored. To this end, we benchmark the methods considered in this paper on CIFAR10 data partitions generated for varied values of $\\alpha = \\{0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5\\}$ (smaller $\\alpha$ corresponds to higher level of heterogeneity). Table~\\ref{table3} shows that iAcc of the three baselines monotonically decreases with the level of data heterogeneity. On the other hand, RLU demonstrate a great degree of robustness as it maintains high iAcc across the board; in particular, RLU achieves $93\\%$ or higher instance-level accuracy in all settings, including at the highest level of data heterogeneity ($\\alpha = 0.05$).\n\\begin{figure}[t] \n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width= 0.9 \\linewidth]{images/size.png}\n\t\\caption{The iAcc of RLU utilizing auxiliary dataset $\\mathcal{A}$ as the number of samples per class varies.}\n\\label{size_results} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Effect of the Size of Auxiliary Dataset $\\mathcal{A}$}\n\\label{auxiliary}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t] \n    \\centering\n\t  \\subfloat[Ground Truth]{\n       \\includegraphics[width=0.23\\linewidth]{images/gt_CIFAR10.png}}\n       \\hspace{0.3in}\n        \\subfloat[IG (Joint Optimization)]{\n        \\includegraphics[width=0.23\\linewidth]{images/joint_cifar10.png}}\n       \\hspace{0.3in}\n\t  \\subfloat[Improved by RLU]{\n        \\includegraphics[width=0.23\\linewidth]{images/RLU_cifar10.png}}\n\t\\caption{Batch image reconstruction (batch size set to 9) on CIFAR10 compared to IG \\citep{geiping}. We select the best reconstructed batch for visualization and display the average metrics of the selected batches.}\n\\label{IG_visualization} \n\\end{figure*}\n\nAs previously discussed, RLU needs an auxiliary dataset $\\mathcal{A}$ to estimate moments of the output logits distribution. In the benchmarking experiments presented thus far, we used $100$ samples for each class in $\\mathcal{A}$. To analyze the effect of the size of auxiliary dataset on the performance of RLU, we conduct $4$ sets of experiments that utilize $4$ auxiliary datasets with: (1) $5$ samples per class; (2) $10$ samples per class; (3) $50$ samples per class; and (4) $100$ samples per class. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{size_results}, there appears to be no significant performance degradation due to reduction of the auxiliary data set size. When using the smallest among the auxiliary sets, on SVHN and Tiny the proposed RLU achieves performance close to the baseline. The largest performance gap is on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, and even there the gap is only $2.4\\%$ and $3.1\\%$, respectively. Therefore, RLU exhibits robustness with respect to the variations in the size of the auxiliary data set used by the server. \n\n\\subsection{Attacks on Different FL Schemes}\n\\label{different_fl}\nTo the best of our knowledge, prior works evaluate their methods only on FedAvg. While FedAvg is indeed the oldest and perhaps the most widely used FL scheme, a number of other FL schemes has grown to prominence yet remains largely unexplored in the context of label recovery. As discussed in Section \\ref{beyond_fedavg}, we provide a framework to conduct label recovery attacks on several regularization-based FL schemes that may be using various optimizers. Table~\\ref{table4} shows the superior performance of RLU in the experiments on FedProx and SGDm. As can be seen from the table, in the experiments where $\\lambda = 0.5$ and $\\gamma = 0.1$ (which leads to $\\rho^{(\\tau)} \\approx 1$), the three baselines achieve performance similar to that in their attacks on FedAvg. However, as $\\rho^{(\\tau)}$ deviates from $1$ when $\\lambda = 5$ and $\\gamma = 0.9$, performance of the baselines severely deteriorates while RLU maintain its iAcc of at least $88\\%$. \n\n\\subsection{Improved Gradient Inversion Attacks with RLU}\nThe outstanding performance of RLU on label recovery can improve the gradient inversion attacks in federated learning. In the prior work IG \\citep{geiping}, an HBC server performs joint optimization of the reconstructed labels $\\mathbf{y}^{\\prime}$ and images $\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}$, which typically results in slow convergence and poor quality of the reconstructed images. We conduct gradients inversion attack experiments on CIFAR10, where we use RLU to estimate labels $\\mathbf{y}^{\\prime}$ from local updates and only optimize the reconstructed images $\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}$ according to Eq. \\ref{ig}. To quantitatively characterize the quality of reconstructed images, we compute the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) \\citep{LPIPS} of the reconstructed images in each batch. As illustrated in Fig. \\ref{IG_visualization}, images reconstructed with the help of RLU have higher PSNR and lower LPIPS, indicating smaller distance to the original images. \n\\label{different}\n\n"

                "\\label{conclusion}\nIn this paper, we studied label recovery attacks on federated learning systems in which clients send their local model updates to the server for aggregation. We developed RLU, a novel label recovery method which solves a least-square problem constructed by examining the correlation between the number of samples of each label type and local updates of the output layer. We extended the proposed framework to real-world scenarios involving well-trained models, multiple local epochs, high levels of data heterogeneity and various local objective functions, and provided theoretical analysis of RLU in different FL schemes. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets, three model architectures and six activation functions demonstrate consistently high accuracy, robustness and universality of RLU. Moreover, gradients inversion attack experiments illustrate that utilizing RLU may significantly improve quality of the reconstructed data in term of two widely-used metrics, PSNR and LPIPS. Future work will include exploring defense mechanism that may help ameliorate safety concerns caused by RLU.\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Existing label recovery methods, which are crucial for accelerating data recovery in GI attacks, suffer from several limitations. These methods often assume no repeated labels in a batch, use non-negative network activation functions, or perform well only on untrained models. Additionally, they typically assume that each client runs only a single epoch when updating its local model, while more practical settings with multiple epochs of local training are not considered. Furthermore, these studies are limited to scenarios where a server collects gradients and do not apply to the standard FL setting where the server collects model updates rather than the gradients. These limitations highlight the need for a more robust and practical label recovery method that can handle real-world FL settings, including multiple local epochs, heterogeneous data, and various optimizers.

For example, language models can improve speech recognition and text entry, and image models can automatically select good photos. However, this rich data is often privacy sensitive, large in quantity, or both, which may preclude logging to the data center and training there using conventional approaches. We advocate an alternative that leaves the training data distributed on the mobile devices, and learns a shared model by aggregating locally-computed updates. We term this decentralized approach Federated Learning. \nWe present a practical method for the federated learning of deep networks based on iterative model averaging, and conduct an extensive empirical evaluation, considering five different model architectures and four datasets. These experiments demonstrate the approach is robust to the unbalanced and non-IID data distributions that are a defining characteristic of this setting. Communication costs are the principal constraint, and we show a reduction in required communication rounds by 10-100x as compared to synchronized stochastic gradient descent.\n@inproceedings{fedavg,\n  title={Communication-efficient learning of deep networks from decentralized data},\n  author={McMahan, Brendan and Moore, Eider and Ramage, Daniel and Hampson, Seth and y Arcas, Blaise Aguera},\n  booktitle={Artificial intelligence and statistics},\n  pages={1273--1282},\n  year={2017},\n  organization={PMLR}\n}\n\n@article{yangqiang,\n  title={Federated machine learning: Concept and applications},\n  author={Yang, Qiang and Liu, Yang and Chen, Tianjian and Tong, Yongxin},\n  journal={ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology (TIST)},\n  volume={10},\n  number={2},\n  pages={1--19},\n  year={2019},\n  publisher={ACM New York, NY, USA}\n}\n\nAbstract: Collaborative machine learning and related techniques such as federated learning allow multiple participants, each with his own training dataset, to build a joint model by training locally and periodically exchanging model updates. We demonstrate that these updates leak unintended information about participants' training data and develop passive and active inference attacks to exploit this leakage. First, we show that an adversarial participant can infer the presence of exact data points -- for example, specific locations -- in others' training data (i.e., membership inference). Then, we show how this adversary can infer properties that hold only for a subset of the training data and are independent of the properties that the joint model aims to capture. For example, he can infer when a specific person first appears in the photos used to train a binary gender classifier. We evaluate our attacks on a variety of tasks, datasets, and learning configurations, analyze their limitations, and discuss possible defenses.\n@inproceedings{property,\n  title={Exploiting unintended feature leakage in collaborative learning},\n  author={Melis, Luca and Song, Congzheng and De Cristofaro, Emiliano and Shmatikov, Vitaly},\n  booktitle={2019 IEEE symposium on security and privacy (SP)},\n  pages={691--706},\n  year={2019},\n  organization={IEEE}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{membership,\n  title={Membership inference attacks against machine learning models},\n  author={Shokri, Reza and Stronati, Marco and Song, Congzheng and Shmatikov, Vitaly},\n  booktitle={2017 IEEE symposium on security and privacy (SP)},\n  pages={3--18},\n  year={2017},\n  organization={IEEE}\n}\n\n@article{dlg,\n  title={Deep leakage from gradients},\n  author={Zhu, Ligeng and Liu, Zhijian and Han, Song},\n  journal={Advances in neural information processing systems},\n  volume={32},\n  year={2019}\n}\n\nAbstract: It is widely believed that sharing gradients will not leak private training data in distributed learning systems such as Collaborative Learning and Federated Learning, etc. Recently, Zhu et al. presented an approach which shows the possibility to obtain private training data from the publicly shared gradients. In their Deep Leakage from Gradient (DLG) method, they synthesize the dummy data and corresponding labels with the supervision of shared gradients. However, DLG has difficulty in convergence and discovering the ground-truth labels consistently. In this paper, we find that sharing gradients definitely leaks the ground-truth labels. We propose a simple but reliable approach to extract accurate data from the gradients. Particularly, our approach can certainly extract the ground-truth labels as opposed to DLG, hence we name it Improved DLG (iDLG). Our approach is valid for any differentiable model trained with cross-entropy loss over one-hot labels. We mathematically illustrate how our method can extract ground-truth labels from the gradients and empirically demonstrate the advantages over DLG.\n@article{idlg,\n  title={idlg: Improved deep leakage from gradients},\n  author={Zhao, Bo and Mopuri, Konda Reddy and Bilen, Hakan},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2001.02610},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\nAbstract: Training deep neural networks requires gradient estimation from data batches to update parameters. Gradients per parameter are averaged over a set of data and this has been presumed to be safe for privacy-preserving training in joint, collaborative, and federated learning applications. Prior work only showed the possibility of recovering input data given gradients under very restrictive conditions – a single input point, or a network with no non-linearities, or a small 32 × 32 px input batch. Therefore, averaging gradients over larger batches was thought to be safe. In this work, we introduce GradInversion, using which input images from a larger batch (8 – 48 images) can also be recovered for large networks such as ResNets (50 layers), on complex datasets such as ImageNet (1000 classes, 224 × 224 px). We formulate an optimization task that converts random noise into natural images, matching gradients while regularizing image fidelity. We also propose an algorithm for target class label recovery given gradients. We further propose a group consistency regularization framework, where multiple agents starting from different random seeds work together to find an enhanced reconstruction of the original data batch. We show that gradients encode a surprisingly large amount of information, such that all the individual images can be recovered with high fidelity via GradInversion, even for complex datasets, deep networks, and large batch sizes.\n@inproceedings{yin,\n  title={See through gradients: Image batch recovery via gradinversion},\n  author={Yin, Hongxu and Mallya, Arun and Vahdat, Arash and Alvarez, Jose M and Kautz, Jan and Molchanov, Pavlo},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition},\n  pages={16337--16346},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\nAbstract: The explosion of image data on the Internet has the potential to foster more sophisticated and robust models and algorithms to index, retrieve, organize and interact with images and multimedia data. But exactly how such data can be harnessed and organized remains a critical problem. We introduce here a new database called “ImageNet”, a large-scale ontology of images built upon the backbone of the WordNet structure. ImageNet aims to populate the majority of the 80,000 synsets of WordNet with an average of 500-1000 clean and full resolution images. This will result in tens of millions of annotated images organized by the semantic hierarchy of WordNet. This paper offers a detailed analysis of ImageNet in its current state: 12 subtrees with 5247 synsets and 3.2 million images in total. We show that ImageNet is much larger in scale and diversity and much more accurate than the current image datasets. Constructing such a large-scale database is a challenging task. We describe the data collection scheme with Amazon Mechanical Turk. Lastly, we illustrate the usefulness of ImageNet through three simple applications in object recognition, image classification and automatic object clustering. We hope that the scale, accuracy, diversity and hierarchical structure of ImageNet can offer unparalleled opportunities to researchers in the computer vision community and beyond.\n@inproceedings{imagenet,\n  title={Imagenet: A large-scale hierarchical image database},\n  author={Deng, Jia and Dong, Wei and Socher, Richard and Li, Li-Jia and Li, Kai and Fei-Fei, Li},\n  booktitle={2009 IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition},\n  pages={248--255},\n  year={2009},\n  organization={Ieee}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{irlg,\n  title={Instance-wise Batch Label Restoration via Gradients in Federated Learning},\n  author={Ma, Kailang and Sun, Yu and Cui, Jian and Li, Dawei and Guan, Zhenyu and Liu, Jianwei},\n  booktitle={The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\nAbstract: Distributed learning paradigms such as federated learning often involve transmission of model updates, or gradients, over a network, thereby avoiding transmission of private data. However, it is possible for sensitive information about the training data to be revealed from such gradients. Prior works have demonstrated that labels can be revealed analytically from the last layer of certain models (e.g., ResNet), or they can be reconstructed jointly with model inputs by using Gradients Matching [Zhu et al'19] with additional knowledge about the current state of the model. In this work, we propose a method to discover the set of labels of training samples from only the gradient of the last layer and the id to label mapping. Our method is applicable to a wide variety of model architectures across multiple domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for model training in two domains - image classification, and automatic speech recognition. Furthermore, we show that existing reconstruction techniques improve their efficacy when used in conjunction with our method. Conversely, we demonstrate that gradient quantization and sparsification can significantly reduce the success of the attack.\n@article{rlg,\n  title={Revealing and protecting labels in distributed training},\n  author={Dang, Trung and Thakkar, Om and Ramaswamy, Swaroop and Mathews, Rajiv and Chin, Peter and Beaufays, Fran{\\c{c}}oise},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={34},\n  pages={1727--1738},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\nAbstract: In this work, we investigate the effect of convolutional network depth, receptive field size, dropout layers, rectified activation unit type and dataset noise on its accuracy in Tiny-ImageNet Challenge settings.

We keep increasing network depth or reducing receptive field size, and continue applying modern techniques, such as PReLu and dropout, to the model.

Recent studies find that the exchanged gradients also take the risk of privacy leakage, e.g., an attacker can invert the shared gradients and recover sensitive data against an FL system by leveraging pre-trained generative adversarial networks (GAN) as prior knowledge. However, performing gradient inversion attacks in the latent space of the GAN model limits their expression ability and generalizability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Gradient Inversion over Feature Domains (GIFD), which disassembles the GAN model and searches the feature domains of the intermediate layers. Instead of optimizing only over the initial latent code, we progressively change the optimized layer, from the initial latent space to intermediate layers closer to the output images. In addition, we design a regularizer to avoid unreal image generation by adding a small l1 ball constraint to the searching range. We also extend GIFD to the out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, which weakens the assumption that the training sets of GANs and FL tasks obey the same data distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve pixel-level reconstruction and is superior to the existing methods. Notably, GIFD also shows great generalizability under different defense strategy settings and batch sizes.\n@inproceedings{gifd,\n  title={GIFD: A Generative Gradient Inversion Method with Feature Domain Optimization},\n  author={Fang, Hao and Chen, Bin and Wang, Xuan and Wang, Zhi and Xia, Shu-Tao},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision},\n  pages={4967--4976},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\nAbstract: Federated learning has gained recognitions as a secure approach for safeguarding local private data in collaborative learning. But the advent of gradient inversion research has posed significant challenges to this premise by enabling a third-party to recover groundtruth images via gradients. While prior research has predominantly focused on low-resolution images and small batch sizes, this study highlights the feasibility of reconstructing complex images with high resolutions and large batch sizes. The success of the proposed method is contingent on constructing an over-parameterized convolutional network, so that images are generated before fitting to the gradient matching requirement. Practical experiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves high-fidelity image recovery, surpassing state-of-the-art competitors that commonly fail in more intricate scenarios. Consequently, our study shows that local participants in a federated learning system are vulnerable to potential data leakage issues.

Without further privacy mechanisms such as differential privacy, this leaves the system vulnerable against an attacker who inverts those gradients to reveal clients sensitive data. However, a gradient is often insufficient to reconstruct the user data without any prior knowledge. By exploiting a generative model pretrained on the data distribution, we demonstrate that data privacy can be easily breached. Further, when such prior knowledge is unavailable, we investigate the possibility of learning the prior from a sequence of gradients seen in the process of FL training. We experimentally show that the prior in a form of generative model is learnable from iterative interactions in FL. Our findings strongly suggest that additional mechanisms are necessary to prevent privacy leakage in FL.\n@article{generative,\n  title={Gradient inversion with generative image prior},\n  author={Jeon, Jinwoo and Lee, Kangwook and Oh, Sewoong and Ok, Jungseul and others},\n  journal={Advances in neural information processing systems},\n  volume={34},\n  pages={29898--29908},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\nAbstract: Abstract Federated learning enables multiple users to build a joint model by sharing their model updates (gradients), while their raw data remains local on their devices. In contrast to the common belief that this provides privacy benefits, we here add to the very recent results on privacy risks when sharing gradients. Specifically, we investigate Label Leakage from Gradients (LLG), a novel attack to extract the labels of the users’ training data from their shared gradients. The attack exploits the direction and magnitude of gradients to determine the presence or absence of any label. LLG is simple yet effective, capable of leaking potential sensitive information represented by labels, and scales well to arbitrary batch sizes and multiple classes. We mathematically and empirically demonstrate the validity of the attack under different settings. Moreover, empirical results show that LLG successfully extracts labels with high accuracy at the early stages of model training. We also discuss different defense mechanisms against such leakage. Our findings suggest that gradient compression is a practical technique to mitigate the attack.\n@article{llg,\n  title={User-level label leakage from gradients in federated learning},\n  author={Wainakh, Aidmar and Ventola, Fabrizio and M{\\\"u}{\\ss}ig, Till and Keim, Jens and Cordero, Carlos Garcia and Zimmer, Ephraim and Grube, Tim and Kersting, Kristian and M{\\\"u}hlh{\\\"a}user, Max},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2105.09369},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\nAbstract: Unlike traditional central training, federated learning (FL) improves the performance of the global model by sharing and aggregating local models rather than local data to protect the users' privacy. Although this training approach appears secure, some research has demonstrated that an attacker can still recover private data based on the shared gradient information. This on-the-fly reconstruction attack deserves to be studied in depth because it can occur at any stage of training, whether at the beginning or at the end of model training; no relevant dataset is required and no additional models need to be trained. We break through some unrealistic assumptions and limitations to apply this reconstruction attack in a broader range of scenarios. We propose methods that can reconstruct the training data from shared gradients or weights, corresponding to the FedSGD and FedAvg usage scenarios, respectively. We propose a zero-shot approach to restore labels even if there are duplicate labels in the batch. We study the relationship between the label and image restoration. We find that image restoration fails even if there is only one incorrectly inferred label in the batch; we also find that when batch images have the same label, the corresponding image is restored as a fusion of that class of images. Our approaches are evaluated on classic image benchmarks, including CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. The batch size, image quality, and the adaptability of the label distribution of our approach exceed those of GradInversion, the state-of-the-art.\n@article{zlg,\n  title={Towards general deep leakage in federated learning},\n  author={Geng, Jiahui and Mou, Yongli and Li, Feifei and Li, Qing and Beyan, Oya and Decker, Stefan and Rong, Chunming},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2110.09074},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\nAbstract: Federated Learning is a distributed learning paradigm with two key challenges that differentiate it from traditional distributed optimization: (1) significant variability in terms of the systems characteristics on each device in the network (systems heterogeneity), and (2) non-identically distributed data across the network (statistical heterogeneity). In this work, we introduce a framework, FedProx, to tackle heterogeneity in federated networks. FedProx can be viewed as a generalization and re-parametrization of FedAvg, the current state-of-the-art method for federated learning. While this re-parameterization makes only minor modifications to the method itself, these modifications have important ramifications both in theory and in practice. Theoretically, we provide convergence guarantees for our framework when learning over data from non-identical distributions (statistical heterogeneity), and while adhering to device-level systems constraints by allowing each participating device to perform a variable amount of work (systems heterogeneity). Practically, we demonstrate that FedProx allows for more robust convergence than FedAvg across a suite of realistic federated datasets. In particular, in highly heterogeneous settings, FedProx demonstrates significantly more stable and accurate convergence behavior relative to FedAvg---improving absolute test accuracy by 22% on average.\n@article{fedprox,\n  title={Federated optimization in heterogeneous networks},\n  author={Li, Tian and Sahu, Anit Kumar and Zaheer, Manzil and Sanjabi, Maziar and Talwalkar, Ameet and Smith, Virginia},\n  journal={Proceedings of Machine learning and systems},\n  volume={2},\n  pages={429--450},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\nAbstract: We propose a novel federated learning method for distributively training neural network models, where the server orchestrates cooperation between a subset of randomly chosen devices in each round. We view Federated Learning problem primarily from a communication perspective and allow more device level computations to save transmission costs. We point out a fundamental dilemma, in that the minima of the local-device level empirical loss are inconsistent with those of the global empirical loss. Different from recent prior works, that either attempt inexact minimization or utilize devices for parallelizing gradient computation, we propose a dynamic regularizer for each device at each round, so that in the limit the global and device solutions are aligned. We demonstrate both through empirical results on real and synthetic data as well as analytical results that our scheme leads to efficient training, in both convex and non-convex settings, while being fully agnostic to device heterogeneity and robust to large number of devices, partial participation and unbalanced data.\n@article{feddyn,\n  title={Federated learning based on dynamic regularization},\n  author={Acar, Durmus Alp Emre and Zhao, Yue and Navarro, Ramon Matas and Mattina, Matthew and Whatmough, Paul N and Saligrama, Venkatesh},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2111.04263},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\nAbstract: Federated Averaging (FedAvg) has emerged as the algorithm of choice for federated learning due to its simplicity and low communication cost. However, in spite of recent research efforts, its performance is not fully understood. We obtain tight convergence rates for FedAvg and prove that it suffers from `client-drift' when the data is heterogeneous (non-iid), resulting in unstable and slow convergence. \nAs a solution, we propose a new algorithm (SCAFFOLD) which uses control variates (variance reduction) to correct for the `client-drift' in its local updates. We prove that SCAFFOLD requires significantly fewer communication rounds and is not affected by data heterogeneity or client sampling. Further, we show that (for quadratics) SCAFFOLD can take advantage of similarity in the client's data yielding even faster convergence. The latter is the first result to quantify the usefulness of local-steps in distributed optimization.\n@inproceedings{scaffold,\n  title={Scaffold: Stochastic controlled averaging for federated learning},\n  author={Karimireddy, Sai Praneeth and Kale, Satyen and Mohri, Mehryar and Reddi, Sashank and Stich, Sebastian and Suresh, Ananda Theertha},\n  booktitle={International conference on machine learning},\n  pages={5132--5143},\n  year={2020},\n  organization={PMLR}\n}\n\nAbstract: Federated learning (FL) allows multiple clients to collectively train a high-performance global model without sharing their private data. However, the key challenge in federated learning is that the clients have significant statistical heterogeneity among their local data distributions, which would cause inconsistent optimized local models on the clientside. To address this fundamental dilemma, we propose a novel federated learning algorithm with local drift decoupling and correction (FedDC). Our FedDC only introduces lightweight modifications in the local training phase, in which each client utilizes an auxiliary local drift variable to track the gap between the local model parameter and the global model parameters. The key idea of FedDC is to utilize this learned local drift variable to bridge the gap, i.e., conducting consistency in parameter-level. The experiment results and analysis demonstrate that FedDC yields expediting convergence and better performance on various image classification tasks, robust in partial participation settings, non-iid data, and heterogeneous clients.\n@inproceedings{feddc,\n  title={Feddc: Federated learning with non-iid data via local drift decoupling and correction},\n  author={Gao, Liang and Fu, Huazhu and Li, Li and Chen, Yingwen and Xu, Ming and Xu, Cheng-Zhong},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF conference on computer vision and pattern recognition},\n  pages={10112--10121},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\nAbstract: The statistical testing technique is considered to compare the metrics values of machine learning models on a test set. Since the values of metrics depend not only on the models, but also on the data, it may turn out that different models are the best on different test sets. For this reason, the traditional approach to comparing the values of metrics on a test set is often not enough. Sometimes a statistical comparison of the results obtained on the basis of cross-validation is used, but in this case it is impossible to guarantee the independence of the obtained measurements, which does not allow the use of the Student's t-test. There are criteria that do not require independent measurements, but they have less power. For additive metrics, a technique is proposed in this paper, when a test sample is divided into N parts, on each of which the values of the metrics are calculated. Since the value on each part is obtained as the sum of independent random variables, according to the central limit theorem, the obtained metrics values on each of the N parts are realizations of the normally distributed random variable. To estimate the required sample size, it is proposed to use normality tests and build quantile– quantile plots. You can then use a modification of the Student's t-test to conduct a statistical test comparing the mean values of the metrics. A simplified approach is also considered, in which confidence intervals are built for the base model. A model whose metric values do not fall into this interval works differently from the base model. This approach reduces the amount of computations needed, however, an experimental analysis of the binary cross-entropy metric for CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction models showed that it is more rough than the first one.\n@article{sgd,\n  title={An overview of gradient descent optimization algorithms},\n  author={Ruder, Sebastian},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1609.04747},\n  year={2016}\n}\n\nAbstract: Multilayer neural networks trained with the back-propagation algorithm constitute the best example of a successful gradient based learning technique. Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques. It is deployed commercially and reads several million cheques per day.\n@article{lenet,\n  title={Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition},\n  author={LeCun, Yann and Bottou, L{\\'e}on and Bengio, Yoshua and Haffner, Patrick},\n  journal={Proceedings of the IEEE},\n  volume={86},\n  number={11},\n  pages={2278--2324},\n  year={1998},\n  publisher={Ieee}\n}\n\nAbstract: Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers - 8× deeper than VGG nets [40] but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28% relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset.

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results.

Each data server is assumed to provide local neural network weights, which are modeled through our framework. We then develop an inference approach that allows us to synthesize a more expressive global network without additional supervision, data pooling and with as few as a single communication round.

Like rectified linear units (ReLUs), leaky ReLUs (LReLUs) and parametrized ReLUs (PReLUs), ELUs alleviate the vanishing gradient problem via the identity for positive values. However, ELUs have improved learning characteristics compared to the units with other activation functions. In contrast to ReLUs, ELUs have negative values which allows them to push mean unit activations closer to zero like batch normalization but with lower computational complexity. Mean shifts toward zero speed up learning by bringing the normal gradient closer to the unit natural gradient because of a reduced bias shift effect. While LReLUs and PReLUs have negative values, too, they do not ensure a noise-robust deactivation state. ELUs saturate to a negative value with smaller inputs and thereby decrease the forward propagated variation and information. Therefore, ELUs code the degree of presence of particular phenomena in the input, while they do not quantitatively model the degree of their absence. In experiments, ELUs lead not only to faster learning, but also to significantly better generalization performance than ReLUs and LReLUs on networks with more than 5 layers. On CIFAR-100 ELUs networks significantly outperform ReLU networks with batch normalization while batch normalization does not improve ELU networks. ELU networks are among the top 10 reported CIFAR-10 results and yield the best published result on CIFAR-100, without resorting to multi-view evaluation or model averaging. On ImageNet, ELU networks considerably speed up learning compared to a ReLU network with the same architecture, obtaining less than 10% classification error for a single crop, single model network.\n@article{elu,\n  title={Fast and accurate deep network learning by exponential linear units (elus)},\n  author={Clevert, Djork-Arn{\\'e} and Unterthiner, Thomas and Hochreiter, Sepp},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.07289},\n  year={2015}\n}\n\nAbstract: Deep Learning has revolutionized vision via convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and natural language processing via recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, success stories of Deep Learning with standard feed-forward neural networks (FNNs) are rare. FNNs that perform well are typically shallow and, therefore cannot exploit many levels of abstract representations. We introduce self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) to enable high-level abstract representations. While batch normalization requires explicit normalization, neuron activations of SNNs automatically converge towards zero mean and unit variance. The activation function of SNNs are \"scaled exponential linear units\" (SELUs), which induce self-normalizing properties. Using the Banach fixed-point theorem, we prove that activations close to zero mean and unit variance that are propagated through many network layers will converge towards zero mean and unit variance -- even under the presence of noise and perturbations. This convergence property of SNNs allows to (1) train deep networks with many layers, (2) employ strong regularization, and (3) to make learning highly robust. Furthermore, for activations not close to unit variance, we prove an upper and lower bound on the variance, thus, vanishing and exploding gradients are impossible. We compared SNNs on (a) 121 tasks from the UCI machine learning repository, on (b) drug discovery benchmarks, and on (c) astronomy tasks with standard FNNs and other machine learning methods such as random forests and support vector machines. SNNs significantly outperformed all competing FNN methods at 121 UCI tasks, outperformed all competing methods at the Tox21 dataset, and set a new record at an astronomy data set. The winning SNN architectures are often very deep.

Related problems like document character recognition have been widely studied by computer vision and machine learning researchers and are virtually solved for practical applications like reading handwritten digits. Reliably recognizing characters in more complex scenes like photographs, however, is far more difficult: the best existing methods lag well behind human performance on the same tasks. In this paper we attack the problem of recognizing digits in a real application using unsupervised feature learning methods: reading house numbers from street level photos. To this end, we introduce a new benchmark dataset for research use containing over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from Street View images. We then demonstrate the difficulty of recognizing these digits when the problem is approached with hand-designed features. Finally, we employ variants of two recently proposed unsupervised feature learning methods and find that they are convincingly superior on our benchmarks.\n@article{svhn,\n  title={Reading digits in natural images with unsupervised feature learning},\n  author={Netzer, Yuval and Wang, Tao and Coates, Adam and Bissacco, Alessandro and Wu, Bo and Ng, Andrew Y},\n  year={2011}\n}\n\nAbstract: While it is nearly effortless for humans to quickly assess the perceptual similarity between two images, the underlying processes are thought to be quite complex. Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called \"perceptual losses\"? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations.\n@inproceedings{LPIPS,\n  title={The unreasonable effectiveness of deep features as a perceptual metric},\n  author={Zhang, Richard and Isola, Phillip and Efros, Alexei A and Shechtman, Eli and Wang, Oliver},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition},\n  pages={586--595},\n  year={2018}\n}\n\nAbstract: Heterogeneity of data distributed across clients limits the performance of global models trained through federated learning, especially in the settings with highly imbalanced class distributions of local datasets. In recent years, personalized federated learning (pFL) has emerged as a potential solution to the challenges presented by heterogeneous data. However, existing pFL methods typically enhance performance of local models at the expense of the global model's accuracy. We propose FedHKD (Federated Hyper-Knowledge Distillation), a novel FL algorithm in which clients rely on knowledge distillation (KD) to train local models. In particular, each client extracts and sends to the server the means of local data representations and the corresponding soft predictions -- information that we refer to as ``hyper-knowledge\". The server aggregates this information and broadcasts it to the clients in support of local training. Notably, unlike other KD-based pFL methods, FedHKD does not rely on a public dataset nor it deploys a generative model at the server. We analyze convergence of FedHKD and conduct extensive experiments on visual datasets in a variety of scenarios, demonstrating that FedHKD provides significant improvement in both personalized as well as global model performance compared to state-of-the-art FL methods designed for heterogeneous data settings.\n@article{fedhkd,\n  title={The best of both worlds: Accurate global and personalized models through federated learning with data-free hyper-knowledge distillation},\n  author={Chen, Huancheng and Vikalo, Haris and others},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2301.08968},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\nAbstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-promoting framework that enables potentially large number of clients to collaboratively train machine learning models. In an FL system, a server coordinates the collaboration by collecting and aggregating clients' model updates while the clients' data remains local and private. A major challenge in federated learning arises when the local data is non-iid - the setting in which performance of the learned global model may deteriorate significantly compared to the scenario where the data is identically distributed across the clients. In this paper we propose FedDPMS (Federated Differentially Private Means Sharing), an FL algorithm in which clients augment local datasets with data synthesized using differentially private information collected and communicated by a trusted server. In particular, the server matches the pairs of clients having complementary local datasets and facilitates differentially-private sharing of the means of latent data representations; the clients then deploy variational auto-encoders to enrich their datasets and thus ameliorate the effects of non-iid data distribution. Our experiments on deep image classification tasks demonstrate that FedDPMS outperforms competing state-of-the-art FL methods specifically developed to address the challenge of federated learning on non-iid data.\n@inproceedings{feddpms,\n  title={Federated learning in non-iid settings aided by differentially private synthetic data},\n  author={Chen, Huancheng and Vikalo, Haris},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition},\n  pages={5026--5035},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: While federated learning (FL) systems often utilize quantization to battle communication and computational bottlenecks, they have heretofore been limited to deploying fixed-precision quantization schemes. Meanwhile, the concept of mixed-precision quantization (MPQ), where different layers of a deep learning model are assigned varying bit-width, remains unexplored in the FL settings. We present a novel FL algorithm, FedMPQ, which introduces mixed-precision quantization to resource-heterogeneous FL systems. Specifically, local models, quantized so as to satisfy bit-width constraint, are trained by optimizing an objective function that includes a regularization term which promotes reduction of precision in some of the layers without significant performance degradation. The server collects local model updates, de-quantizes them into full-precision models, and then aggregates them into a global model. To initialize the next round of local training, the server relies on the information learned in the previous training round to customize bit-width assignments of the models delivered to different clients. In extensive benchmarking experiments on several model architectures and different datasets in both iid and non-iid settings, FedMPQ outperformed the baseline FL schemes that utilize fixed-precision quantization while incurring only a minor computational overhead on the participating devices.\n@article{fedmpq,\n  title={Mixed-Precision Quantization for Federated Learning on Resource-Constrained Heterogeneous Devices},\n  author={Chen, Huancheng and Vikalo, Haris},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2311.18129},\n  year={2023}\n}The above content represents the relevant literature in this field.

Existing label recovery methods, which are crucial for accelerating data recovery in GI attacks, suffer from several limitations. These methods often assume no repeated labels in a batch, use non-negative network activation functions, or perform well only on untrained models. Additionally, they typically assume that each client runs only a single epoch when updating its local model, while more practical settings with multiple epochs of local training are not considered. Furthermore, these studies are limited to scenarios where a server collects gradients and do not apply to the standard FL setting where the server collects model updates rather than the gradients. These limitations highlight the need for a more robust and practical label recovery method that can handle real-world FL settings, including multiple local epochs, heterogeneous data, and various optimizers. This paper aims to address these challenges by proposing a novel label recovery scheme that provides near-perfect accuracy when attacking untrained models and maintains high performance in realistic FL settings.\n\n## Main Idea\n\nThe paper introduces RLU (Recovering Labels from Local Updates), a novel label recovery method that solves a least-square problem by analyzing the correlation between labels of data points and the resulting update of the output layer.

A number of such techniques attempts to accelerate data recovery by first reconstructing labels of the samples used in local training. \nHowever, existing label extraction methods make strong assumptions that typically do not hold in realistic FL settings. In this paper we present a novel label recovery scheme, {\\it \n\\underline{R}ecovering \\underline{L}abels from Local \\underline{U}pdates}\n(RLU), which provides near-perfect accuracy when attacking untrained (most vulnerable) models. More significantly, RLU achieves high performance even in realistic real-world settings where the clients in an FL system run multiple local epochs, train on heterogeneous data, and deploy various optimizers to minimize different objective functions. Specifically, RLU estimates labels by solving a least-square problem that emerges from the analysis of the correlation between labels of the data points used in a training round and the resulting update of the output layer. The experimental results on several datasets, architectures, and data heterogeneity scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and helps improve quality of the reconstructed images in GI attacks in terms of both PSNR and LPIPS.\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\n\n\\label{introduction}\n\nFederated learning (FL) \\citep{fedavg}, which aims to enable collaborative training of ML models while protecting privacy of the participating clients, has attracted considerable interest in privacy-sensitive fields such as healthcare and finance \\citep{yangqiang}. However, recent works have demonstrated vulnerability of FL systems to privacy attacks such as membership inference \\citep{membership}, property inference \\citep{property} and gradient inversion \\citep{dlg}. In particular, gradient inversion methods have been shown capable of reconstructing private training data given the gradients computed during local training. The milestone work, Deep Leakage from Gradient (DLG) \\citep{dlg}, minimizes the difference between simulated and true gradients to extract data and the corresponding labels belonging to FL clients training a model for a classification task. \nHowever, DLG does not perform well in settings where the training batch size is large and the data resolution is high, since in such scenarios the joint optimization of data and the corresponding labels becomes challenging. A subsequent study, iDLG \\citep{idlg}, presents an analytical method for the recovery of ground-truth labels from the gradients by exploiting a relationship between the labels and the signs of the gradients. \nGradInversion \\citep{yin} takes a step further by exploiting a relationship between labels and the magnitudes of gradient in the output layer to perfectly restore labels of the samples used in the considered training round, and facilitates high-resolution reconstruction of data in a batch with as many as 48 samples. Unfortunately, this method assumes no repeated labels in the batch, which is unrealistic in real-world settings. Recently, iRLG \\citep{irlg} attempted to address the limitations of GradInversion, enabling recovery of potentially repeated labels in a batch by utilizing gradients computed using a randomly initialized untrained model. However, the performance of iRLG drastically deteriorates as the model's accuracy improves. \n\nThe above label recovery methods either: (1) assume no repeated labels in a batch; (2) use non-negative network activation functions; or (3) perform well only on untrained models. They further assume that each client in an FL system runs only a single epoch when updating its local model, while the more practical settings with multiple epochs of local training are not considered. Moreover, these studies are limited to the scenarios where a server collects gradients\nand do not apply to the standard FL setting where\nthe server collects model updates rather than the gradients.\n\nAiming to address the aforementioned limitations of the prior work, in this paper we propose a novel method for label recovery, \\underline{R}ecovering \\underline{L}abels from Local \\underline{U}pdates (RLU). We start by analyzing correlations between local updates of the output layer and the ground-truth labels of data samples in training batches for several frequently used FL algorithms. These correlations, along with the expected value of the ``erroneous confidence\" (i.e., the level of confidence when making erroneous decisions) evaluated on a small auxiliary dataset, are then used to recover the labels. As local training unfolds across multiple epochs, distribution of the previously mentioned ``erroneous confidence\" undergoes changes which the server cannot access. Simulating an underlying dynamical model helps estimate how this distribution evolves across training epochs; the obtained estimates of intermediate distributions are then utilized to help achieve notable enhancement in the accuracy of label recovery. The effectiveness of RLU is demonstrated in extensive experiments involving several FL algorithms and various model architectures on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100 and Tiny-ImageNet datasets. In all the considered settings, RLU outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both untrained and well-trained models. The main contributions of the paper are summarized as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item We propose a general analytical method that enables the server in an FL system to recover labels of the points used by clients in local training; the proposed method applies to various FL algorithms and makes no assumptions regarding the activation function or batch label composition.\n\n\\item To allow accurate label recovery in FL systems where clients train across multiple epochs, we simulate the evolution of the model through the epochs via a Monte Carlo method that updates the ``erroneous confidence\" characterizing the correlation between local updates and training data labels.\n\n\\item To evaluate the proposed label recovery method, we conduct comprehensive benchmarking experiments across a number of FL settings where we vary the level of data heterogeneity, model architectures and local objective functions. \n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\n\\section{Preliminary and Related Work}\n\n\\label{related_work}\n\\textbf{Federated Learning}. The classical FL algorithm, FedAvg \\citep{fedavg}, enables $K$ clients to collaboratively train global model without sharing their private data $\\mathcal{D}_{k}$. In FedAvg, the server initializes training round $t$ by broadcasting global model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$ to the clients. Client $k$ updates its local model by running a gradient descent procedure on its (private) local data; the server then collects updated local models $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k}$ from the clients and averages them to form a new global model,\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t+1)} = \\sum_{k=1}^{K}p_{k}\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $p_{k}$ denotes the weight assigned to client $k$. Since the training is initialized by broadcasting global model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$ to the clients, local updates are computed as $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k} = \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k} - \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$. It is worth pointing out that in FL algorithms other than FedAvg, $\\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k}$ is not necessarily proportional to the gradients $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k}$. We discuss properties of local updates in Section \\ref{beyond_fedavg}.\n\n\\textbf{Gradients Inversion Attack}. DLG \\citep{dlg} is the first optimization-based method for reconstructing training data given the gradients $\\nabla \\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ and model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$. More specifically, DLG minimizes the difference between simulated and ground-truth gradients,\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{ig}\n    \\mathbf{x}^{\\star}, \\mathbf{y}^{\\star} = \\text{arg}\\min_{\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}, \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime}} \\left\\Vert \\nabla_{\\boldsymbol{\\theta}} \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{task}}(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}, \\mathbf{y}^{\\prime}) - \\nabla \\boldsymbol{\\theta} \\right\\Vert^{2}.\n\\end{equation}\nFollow-up studies \\citep{geiping, yin} introduced total variation and group consistency regularization to the objective of the gradient inversion optimization, enabling high reconstruction performance on ImageNet \\citep{imagenet}. Recently, a number of works \\citep{generative,gifd,overparameter} leveraged pre-trained generative models to improve the gradient inversion attack and achieve state-of-the-art performance with batch size set to $32$. However, these schemes assume knowing the ground-truth labels $\\mathbf{y}$ in the batch -- an unrealistic assumption that significantly accelerates the search for the optimal data $\\mathbf{x}^{\\star}$.\n\\textbf{Label Recovery Attack}. To improve the performance of an attack on gradients computed using samples coming from a relatively large batch, a series of studies \\citep{idlg,yin,rlg,llg,zlg, irlg} proposed various analytical approaches to recovering labels $\\mathbf{y}$ prior to solving the optimization over $\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}$. However, all these methods suffer limitations that restrict their practical feasibility. GradInversion \\citep{yin} assumes there are no repeated labels in a batch; RLG \\citep{rlg} can only recover class-wise labels but not instance-wise labels; LLG \\citep{llg} and ZLG \\citep{zlg} require non-negative activation functions; iRLG \\citep{irlg} performs well only on randomly initialized untrained models. \nMoreover, these methods primarily focus on FedAvg and generally provide little if any discussion of other FL algorithms.\n\n\n\n\\section{Methodology}\n\n\\label{methodology}\n\\subsection{Problem Settings}\n\\label{problem_formulation}\nWe consider multi-class classification models trained in FL settings where an honest-but-curious (HBC) server aims to recover ground-truth labels of the training samples using local updates $\\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}_{k}$ collected from clients while following a standard FL training procedure. The HBC server knows the batch size, number of local epochs and learning rate used by the clients but has no information about local data distribution. We assume each local model is trained by minimizing the cross-entropy (CE) loss \n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{celoss}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ce}} = -\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\sum_{i = 1}^{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\log\\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{q}_{y^{(i)}}^{(i)})}{\\sum_{n = 1}^{N} \\exp(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{(i)})}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{B}$ denotes a training batch; $(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}, y^{(i)})$ is the $i$-th example in the batch; $N$ is the number of classes; and $\\mathbf{q}^{(i)} = \\mathbf{W} \\cdot \\mathbf{e}^{(i)} + \\mathbf{b}$ denotes the output logits of the model given the embedding $\\mathbf{e}^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}$ of $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$, where $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N\\times L}$ and $\\mathbf{b} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ are the weights and bias of the output layer.\n\n\\subsection{ Label Recovery from Local Updates (RLU)}\n\\label{charateristic}\nFollowing the definition of the CE loss in Eq\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\nabla\\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(i)} = \\left\\{\n    \\begin{aligned}\n        & \\;\\;\\;\\; \\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{q}_{j}^{(i)})}{\\sum_{n = 1}^{N} \\exp(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{(i)})} = \\mathbf{s}_{j}(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}), \\text{ if } j \\not = y^{(i)}, \\\\\n        & -\\frac{\\sum_{n \\not = j}\\exp(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{(i)})}{\\sum_{n = 1}^{N} \\exp(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{(i)})}, \\text{ if } j  = y^{(i)}.\\\\\n    \\end{aligned}\n    \\right.\n\\end{equation}\nAssuming stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer, the local update of the $j$-th component of the output layer's bias computed by client $k$ is \n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{local_update}\n     \\Delta\\mathbf{b}_{j} = -\\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}^{\\tau}|}\\sum_{\\tau = 1}^{m}\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\nabla\\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(i,\\tau)}, \\mathcal{B}^{\\tau}\\sim \\mathcal{D}_{k}, \n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\tau$ is the local epoch index, $m$ is the number of epochs, $\\eta$ is the learning rate, and $\\mathcal{D}_{k}$ denotes client $k$'s data. Note that $\\mathbf{s}_{j}(\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}) \\in (0,1)$ can be interpreted as the ``erroneous confidence\" of labeling $\\mathbf{x}^{(i)}$ as class $j$ while $j \\not = y^{(i)}$ (i.e., confidence in a labeling decision that is in fact erroneous). Let $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}$ denote the expected erroneous confidence for class $j$ given a sample with true label $n \\not = j$,\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{S}_{n,j} = \\mathbb{E}_{(\\mathbf{x}, y)\\sim \\mathcal{D}_{k}^{(n)}}\\left[ \\mathbf{s}_{j}(\\mathbf{x})\\right], \\forall n,j \\in [N] \\wedge n \\not = j,\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{D}_{k}^{(n)} \\subseteq \\mathcal{D}_{k}$ collects samples with label $n$ and $(\\mathbf{x}, y)$ is a random sample from $\\mathcal{D}_{k}^{(n)}$. These expectations are indicative of the model's training error: $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j} \\approx \\frac{1}{N}$ in a randomly initialized untrained model making random predictions, whereas $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}$ asymptotically goes to $0$ as the accuracy of the model increases.\n\nNote that the expected erroneous confidence, $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}$ does not admit closed-form expression; to analyze it and gain needed insight, we make the following assumption.\n\\begin{assumption} \n\\label{assumption_1}\nThe output logits $\\mathbf{q}^{(n)}$ of model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ when the input is $\\mathbf{x} \\sim \\mathcal{D}^{(n)}$ follows a multivariate normal distribution, i.e.,\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathbf{q}^{(n)} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{n}),\n\\label{assume31}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere the mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n}$ and covariance $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{n}$ depend on the accuracy of the model. \n\\end{assumption}\n\nFor an untrained deep model whose parameters are initialized from a zero-mean uniform distribution, expected values of the output logits $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{1}, \\dots, \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{N}$ are approximately $\\mathbf{0}$. As the accuracy of the model improves during the training process, $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{j,j}$ converges to a positive value while $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n,j} (n \\not= j)$ converges to a negative value, forcing $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}$ to converge to $0$. The existing methods that perform well only on untrained models operate under the assumption $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n} = \\mathbf{0}$, which does not hold for well-trained models. Experimental results that empirically verify Assumption~3.\n\nIn each global round of training, the server leverages global model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$ to obtain estimates of the parameters in (\\ref{assume31}), $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}$ and $\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{n}$, via a Monte Carlo method run on a small auxiliary dataset $\\mathcal{A}$: the samples from $\\mathcal{A}$ are processed by $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$ and the resulting output logits are used to empirically compute the mean and variance. Given the estimates of the parameters, the server samples $M$ data points $ \\mathbf{q}^{(n,i)} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\mu}}_{n}, \\bar{\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}}_{n})$ to infer $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}$ as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{monte_carlo}\n    \\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{n,j} = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum_{i=1}^{M}\\frac{\\exp(\\mathbf{q}^{(n,i)}_{j})}{\\sum_{c=1}^{N}\\exp (\\mathbf{q}_{c}^{(n,i)})}.\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\subsubsection{Single Epoch Local Training}\nWhen $m = 1$, we omit superscript $\\tau$ and let\n$\\Delta\\mathbf{b}_{j} = -\\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\sum_{i=1}^{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\nabla\\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(i)}$\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq_b}\n    \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Delta\\mathbf{b}_{j}\\right] = \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\left(N_{j}\\sum_{n \\not= j} \\mathcal{S}_{j,n} - \\sum_{n \\not = j} N_{n}\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}\\right),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $N_{j}$ denotes the number of samples in $\\mathcal{B}$ with label $j$. Finally, $N_{j}$ is estimated by solving  \n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{minimization}\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\min_{\\mathbf{z}\\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}} \\left\\Vert \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{z} -  \\mathbf{u}\\right\\Vert^{2}_{2} \\\\\n\\text{s.t.}\\quad & \\mathbf{0} \\leq \\mathbf{z} \\leq  \\mathbf{1} \\wedge \\left\\Vert\\mathbf{z}\\right\\Vert_{1} = 1,\n\\end{aligned}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathbf{u} = \\Delta \\mathbf{b}/\\eta$, the diagonal entries of the coefficient matrix $\\mathbf{A}$ are $a_{j,j} = \\sum_{n\\not = j} \\mathcal{S}_{j,n}$, and the $(n,j)$ off-diagonal entry of $\\mathbf{A}$ is $a_{n,j} = -\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}$. After finding the solution $\\mathbf{z}^{\\star}$ to the above problem, we estimate $N_{j}$ as $\\bar{N}_{j} = \\lfloor|\\mathcal{B}|\\cdot \\mathbf{z}^{\\star}_{j}\\rceil$.\n\\subsubsection{Multiple Epochs of Local Training}\n\\label{multiple_epochs}\nTo reduce communication bandwidth, clients in FL typically update their local models over multiple epochs (with multiple batches of data), as illustrated in Eq.~\\ref{local_update}. Assume fixed learning rate $\\eta$ and constant batch size across all epochs (i.e., $|\\mathcal{B}^{\\tau}| = |\\mathcal{B}|$ for all $\\tau$); then the expectation of the local update $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Delta\\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(t)}\\right]$ in global round $t$ can be found as\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{eq_b_multi}\n      \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\sum_{\\tau = 1}^{m}\\left(N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\sum_{n \\not = j} \\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,\\tau)} - \\sum_{n \\not = j} N_{n}^{(t,\\tau)}\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\right),\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}$ is the number of samples with label $j$ in epoch $\\tau$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}$ denotes the expected erroneous confidence of local model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{(t,\\tau-1)}$ on class $j$. At the beginning of local training, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t,0)}_{k}$ is initialized with the global model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$. Note that $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,1)}$ can be estimated using global model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t)}$ while $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,m+1)}$ is readily inferred using the collected local model $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}^{(t,m)}_{k}$ via previously described Monte Carlo procedure. However, the intermediate states $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,2)},\\dots, \\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,m)}$ are unknown since the server does not have access to local models $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{(t,1)},\\dots,\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_{k}^{(t,m-1)}$. Since the evolution of $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}$ is \nnon-linear, trivial interpolation between $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,1)}$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ may be highly inaccurate. To this end, we propose a practical method that relies on dynamics of the model parameter updates to approximate $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,\\tau)}$ in the intermediate epochs. Suppose we know $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,\\tau)}$ and the numbers of samples with different labels \n$N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}$, $j \\in [N]$. Then \n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{update_of_bias}\n    \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Delta \\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\right] = \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\left(N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\sum_{n \\not= j} \\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,\\tau)} - \\sum_{n \\not = j} N_{n}^{(t,\\tau)}\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\right).\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{use_signal_to_update}\n    \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Delta \\mathbf{q}_{j}^{(n)}\\right] = \\Delta \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)} = \\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Delta \\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\right]  \\cdot \\sum_{l=1}^{L}\\bar{\\mathbf{e}}_{l}^{2},\n\\end{equation}\nand then obtain $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau+1)} = \\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)} + \\Delta\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}$. Using $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau+1)}$ in the next local epoch, \none can estimate $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau+1)}$ according to Eq. \\ref{monte_carlo}. By recursively conducting the above procedure, one can estimate all the intermediate states $\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}$. However, $N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}$ and $\\bar{\\mathbf{e}}_{l}$ are not known -- only the average updates of weight $\\Delta \\mathbf{W}_{j,l}^{(t)}$ and bias $\\Delta \\mathbf{b}_{j}^{t}$ are given. A closer examination of the correlation between $\\nabla  \\mathbf{W}_{j,l}^{(t)}$ and $\\nabla \\mathbf{b}_{j}^{t}$ suggests estimating the average embedded\nsignal according to\n\\begin{equation}\n\\label{expectation_of_bias_multiple}\n    \\bar{\\mathbf{e}}_{l} \\approx \\Delta \\mathbf{W}_{j,l}^{(t)} / \\Delta \\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(t)}.\n\\end{equation}\nTo estimate the total number $\\{\\bar{N}_{j}^{(t)}\\}_{j=1}^{N}$ of labels in $m$ sampled batches we first set $N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)} = \\mathbf{g}_{j}$, where $\\mathbf{g}\\in \\mathbb{N}^{N}$ denotes an arbitrarily vector (a guess) satisfying $\\left\\Vert \\mathbf{g}\\right\\Vert_{1} = |\\mathcal{B}|$. As described earlier in this subsection, if we knew $N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}$ we could dynamically update $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,\\tau)}$ to arrive at $\\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$. Since the true $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ is known by the server (collected after the final epoch), the difference between $\\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ could be used to adjust $\\mathbf{g}_{j}$ and subsequently improve the estimate $\\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$. If $\\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ is significantly smaller than $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$, $\\mathbf{g}_{j}$ was underestimated; otherwise, $\\mathbf{g}_{j}$ was overestimated. Intuitively, local model tends to label input data as class $j$ if the samples with label $j$ are dominant in the batches sampled for training.\n\nAfter a number of iterations, the difference between $\\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ and $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)}$ becomes small and $m \\cdot \\mathbf{g}_{j}$ closely approximates $N_{j}^{(t)}$. To accelerate the search for $\\mathbf{g}$, one can introduce $\\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t)} = (\\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,1)} + \\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,m+1)})/2$ and solve optimization (\\ref{minimization}) parameterized by $\\mathcal{S}_{j,n} = \\bar{\\mathcal{S}}_{j,n}^{(t)}$ to obtain an initial estimate $\\bar{N}_{j}^{(t)}$ which, in turn, is used to initialize $\\mathbf{g}_{j} = \\bar{N}_{j}^{(t)}/m$. In our experiments, following such an initialization RLU achieves highly accurate performance after only $T=5$ iterations.\n\n\n\\subsection{FL schemes beyond FedAvg and SGD}\n\\label{beyond_fedavg}\n\\input{src/table1}\n\nThe prior works on GI attacks in FL focused on FedAvg \\citep{fedavg}, where local training pursues minimization of the CE loss, $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ce}}$. Deterioration of the performance of FedAvg observed in non-i.i.d. settings motivated a number of studies \\citep{fedprox,scaffold,feddyn,feddc, fedhkd, feddpms, fedmpq} that address the challenge of data heterogeneity by introducing various regularization terms to the local objective function. In particular, those methods consider objectives that are combination of the empirical risk and a regularizer, i.e.,\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{local}} = \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ce}} + \\mathcal{L}_{\\text{regularizer}}.\n\\end{equation}\nFor such objectives, the local updates of the bias collected by a server are not proportional to the gradients of $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ce}}$, adversely affecting the efficacy of the existing methods that attempt to recover labels from gradients. Furthermore, the existing label recovery methods assume that the local models are updated using SGD optimizers. When optimizers other than SGD are used, local updates are generally not proportional to the gradients of $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text{ce}}$. To explore such settings, we analyze the expectation of local updates in several milestone non-i.i.d. FL schemes and consider two well-known variants of SGD \\citep{sgd}, SGD with momentum (SGDm) and Nesterov accelerated gradient method (NAG). To accommodate these more general cases, we rephrase the expectation of the $j$-th component of the local update of bias $\\mathbb{E}\\left[\\Delta\\mathbf{b}_{j}^{(t)}\\right]$ in global round $t$ as\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\frac{\\eta}{|\\mathcal{B}|}\\sum_{\\tau = 1}^{m}\\rho^{(\\tau)}\\left(N_{j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\sum_{n\\not= j} \\mathcal{S}_{j,n}^{(t,\\tau)} - \\sum_{n \\not= j} N_{n}^{(t,\\tau)}\\mathcal{S}_{n,j}^{(t,\\tau)}\\right) - \\mathbf{h}_{j}^{(t)},\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\rho^{(\\tau)}$ is a constant that depends on hyper-parameters used by different methods and remains constant across global rounds, and $\\mathbf{h}_{j}^{(t)}$ is a term capturing historical training information (past local updates). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies label recovery attacks in FL schemes beyond FedAvg.\nIn FL schemes that utilize only the gradient information computed in the current global round (e.g., FedAvg and FedProx) \n$\\mathbf{h}_{j}^{t} = \\mathbf{0}$, while for the schemes that also\nrely on the past gradient information (Scaffold, FedDyn and FedDC)\n$\\mathbf{h}_{j}^{t} \\not = \\mathbf{0}$. In any case, $\\rho^{(\\tau)}$ and $\\mathbf{h}_{j}^{(t)}$ are known to the server and may potentially be used for label recovery attacks. In our work, we rely on the procedure for label recovery from local updates discussed in the previous section to run RLU attacks on different FL schemes where $\\rho^{(\\tau)}$ and $\\mathbf{h}_{j}^{t}$ vary from one scheme to another according to Table~\\ref{table1}.\n\n\n```\n\n## Experimental Setup\n\n```json\n[{\"name\": \"Attack on Untrained Models\", \"description\": \"This experiment evaluates the performance of RLU on untrained models across various architectures, datasets, batch sizes, and activation functions.

Throughout these experiments we employ a number of activation functions including ReLU, Tanh, ELU \\citep{elu}, SELU \\citep{selu} and SiLU \\citep{silu} to further  evaluate robustness of our proposed method. To simulate diverse FL scenarios, we follow the strategy in \\citep{bayesian} and utilize Dirichlet distribution with a concentration parameter $\\alpha$, controlling the level of data heterogeneity across $10$ data partitions owned by 10 clients. Unless specified otherwise, the models are trained using SGD optimizers. The auxiliary dataset $\\mathcal{A}$ contains $100$ samples per class.\n\\input{src/table2}\n\n\\subsection{Baselines and Evaluation Metrics}\n\\label{section_metrics}\nWe compare our proposed RLU to three state-of-the-art methods: LLG \\citep{llg}, ZLG \\citep{zlg} and iRLG \\citep{irlg}, all capable of recovering repeated labels in a batch. For fairness, we compare RLU to LLG+ and ZLG+; the latter two utilize the same auxiliary dataset $\\mathcal{A}$ as RLU to achieve improved performance. Following the strategy of iRLG, we quantify the performance of a label recovery attack using two metrics: (1) \\emph{class-level accuracy (cAcc)}: the proportion of correctly recovered classes; (2) \\emph{instance-level accuracy (iAcc)}: the proportion of correctly recovered labels. We recover batch labels from the local updates computed on clients' local dataset and report the average cAcc and iAcc.\n\n\\subsection{Attack on Untrained Models}\n\n\\label{untrained}\nA randomly initialized untrained model may be extremely vulnerable to label recovery attacks; for instance, if the server knows how the training is initialized, it does not even need an auxiliary data set to infer the parameters (e.g., $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n}$) used in the attack. To compare the performance of baseline methods with that of RLU, we conduct comprehensive experiments on untrained models across various architectures, datasets, batch-sizes and activation functions. The results, reported in Table~\\ref{table2}, demonstrate that RLU outperforms the baselines in all settings. When local training consists of a single epoch, RLU achieves near-perfect accuracy across the board in terms of both cAcc and iAcc; iRLG is a close second, outperforming other baselines. Since LLG+ assumes non-negative activation functions, its performance deteriorates significantly with Tanh and SELU. On Tiny-ImageNet, ZLG+ performs the worst among the four methods, achieving under $70\\%$ iAcc.\n\nWhen the clients run $m = 10$ local epochs, performance of all methods deteriorates (as expected based on the discussion in Section \\ref{multiple_epochs}). Nevertheless, the results in Table~\\ref{table2} show that RLU still outperforms the baselines, maintaining at least $84\\%$ cACC and $90\\%$ iAcc on all datasets, architectures and activation functions. While iRLG maintains solid performance on SVHN and Tiny-ImageNet, it performs significantly worse on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 (iAcc falls below $70\\%$, cAcc drops below $50\\%$). The results of LLG+ follow the same pattern exhibited in single epoch settings, while ZLG+ experiences significant performance deterioration on SVHN. For consistency and a comparison with the results in Table~\\ref{table2}, unless stated otherwise, in the remainder of this section the number of local epochs $m$ is set to $10$.\n\n\\subsection{Attack on Trained Models}\n\\label{trained}\n\\begin{figure*}[t] \n    \\centering\n\t  \\subfloat[SVHN]{\n       \\includegraphics[width=0.33\\linewidth]{images/SVHN.png}}\n\t  \\subfloat[CIFAR10]{\n        \\includegraphics[width=0.33\\linewidth]{images/CIFAR10.png}}\n\t  \\subfloat[CIFAR100]{\n        \\includegraphics[width=0.33\\linewidth]{images/CIFAR100.png}}\n\t\\caption{Instance-level accuracy of different attack methods deteriorates as training progresses. Each point on the black dashed curve indicates the training accuracy of the global model in each global round.}\n\\label{trained_models} \n\\end{figure*}\nSince the accuracy of the global model improves as the training proceeds, comparing methods in terms of attacks on untrained model becomes no longer meaningful. As discussed in Section \\ref{charateristic}, distribution of output logits depends on the accuracy of the model which is parameterized by mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}_{n}$ and covariance $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}_{n}$. When the model becomes highly accurate, magnitudes of local gradients (updates) start vanishing; this, in turn, causes high sensitivity to noise and a large error in estimating the labels. All of the methods in Table~\\ref{table2} experience performance deterioration as the model accuracy increases. To compare their robustness, we conduct extensive experiments and evaluate performance of different attack methods at different stages of training. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{trained_models}, RLU outperforms the baselines at all training stages, achieving $80\\%$ iAcc when the model accuracy reaches $80\\%$. For the global model achieving $90\\%$ training accuracy, iAcc of iRLG reaches $75.6 \\%$, $83.3\\%$ and $72.6\\%$ on SVHN, CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, respectively. The iAcc of ZLG+ is $33.3\\%$, $21.1\\%$ and $30.1\\%$ lower than RLU's, while iRLG's trails RLU by $16.3 \\%$, $17.3 \\%$ and $23.9 \\%$ on these three datasets, respectively. The iAcc performance of LLG+ is better than that of other prior methods but still falls significantly behind  RLU's. \n\n\\subsection{Effect of Data Heterogeneity}\n\\label{heterogeneity}\n\\input{src/table3}\n\\input{src/table4}\nData heterogeneity is one the main challenges in real-world applications of federated learning. Prior works on label reconstruction evaluated their proposed methods on i.i.d. data, but the evaluation on non-i.i.d. data has remained largely unexplored. To this end, we benchmark the methods considered in this paper on CIFAR10 data partitions generated for varied values of $\\alpha = \\{0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5\\}$ (smaller $\\alpha$ corresponds to higher level of heterogeneity). Table~\\ref{table3} shows that iAcc of the three baselines monotonically decreases with the level of data heterogeneity. On the other hand, RLU demonstrate a great degree of robustness as it maintains high iAcc across the board; in particular, RLU achieves $93\\%$ or higher instance-level accuracy in all settings, including at the highest level of data heterogeneity ($\\alpha = 0.05$).\n\\begin{figure}[t] \n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width= 0.9 \\linewidth]{images/size.png}\n\t\\caption{The iAcc of RLU utilizing auxiliary dataset $\\mathcal{A}$ as the number of samples per class varies.}\n\\label{size_results} \n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Effect of the Size of Auxiliary Dataset $\\mathcal{A}$}\n\\label{auxiliary}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t] \n    \\centering\n\t  \\subfloat[Ground Truth]{\n       \\includegraphics[width=0.23\\linewidth]{images/gt_CIFAR10.png}}\n       \\hspace{0.3in}\n        \\subfloat[IG (Joint Optimization)]{\n        \\includegraphics[width=0.23\\linewidth]{images/joint_cifar10.png}}\n       \\hspace{0.3in}\n\t  \\subfloat[Improved by RLU]{\n        \\includegraphics[width=0.23\\linewidth]{images/RLU_cifar10.png}}\n\t\\caption{Batch image reconstruction (batch size set to 9) on CIFAR10 compared to IG \\citep{geiping}. We select the best reconstructed batch for visualization and display the average metrics of the selected batches.}\n\\label{IG_visualization} \n\\end{figure*}\n\nAs previously discussed, RLU needs an auxiliary dataset $\\mathcal{A}$ to estimate moments of the output logits distribution. In the benchmarking experiments presented thus far, we used $100$ samples for each class in $\\mathcal{A}$. To analyze the effect of the size of auxiliary dataset on the performance of RLU, we conduct $4$ sets of experiments that utilize $4$ auxiliary datasets with: (1) $5$ samples per class; (2) $10$ samples per class; (3) $50$ samples per class; and (4) $100$ samples per class. As shown in Fig.~\\ref{size_results}, there appears to be no significant performance degradation due to reduction of the auxiliary data set size. When using the smallest among the auxiliary sets, on SVHN and Tiny the proposed RLU achieves performance close to the baseline. The largest performance gap is on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, and even there the gap is only $2.4\\%$ and $3.1\\%$, respectively. Therefore, RLU exhibits robustness with respect to the variations in the size of the auxiliary data set used by the server. \n\n\\subsection{Attacks on Different FL Schemes}\n\\label{different_fl}\nTo the best of our knowledge, prior works evaluate their methods only on FedAvg. While FedAvg is indeed the oldest and perhaps the most widely used FL scheme, a number of other FL schemes has grown to prominence yet remains largely unexplored in the context of label recovery. As discussed in Section \\ref{beyond_fedavg}, we provide a framework to conduct label recovery attacks on several regularization-based FL schemes that may be using various optimizers. Table~\\ref{table4} shows the superior performance of RLU in the experiments on FedProx and SGDm. As can be seen from the table, in the experiments where $\\lambda = 0.5$ and $\\gamma = 0.1$ (which leads to $\\rho^{(\\tau)} \\approx 1$), the three baselines achieve performance similar to that in their attacks on FedAvg. However, as $\\rho^{(\\tau)}$ deviates from $1$ when $\\lambda = 5$ and $\\gamma = 0.9$, performance of the baselines severely deteriorates while RLU maintain its iAcc of at least $88\\%$. \n\n\\subsection{Improved Gradient Inversion Attacks with RLU}\nThe outstanding performance of RLU on label recovery can improve the gradient inversion attacks in federated learning. In the prior work IG \\citep{geiping}, an HBC server performs joint optimization of the reconstructed labels $\\mathbf{y}^{\\prime}$ and images $\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}$, which typically results in slow convergence and poor quality of the reconstructed images. We conduct gradients inversion attack experiments on CIFAR10, where we use RLU to estimate labels $\\mathbf{y}^{\\prime}$ from local updates and only optimize the reconstructed images $\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}$ according to Eq. \\ref{ig}. To quantitatively characterize the quality of reconstructed images, we compute the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) \\citep{LPIPS} of the reconstructed images in each batch. As illustrated in Fig. \\ref{IG_visualization}, images reconstructed with the help of RLU have higher PSNR and lower LPIPS, indicating smaller distance to the original images. \n\\label{different}\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\n\\label{conclusion}\nIn this paper, we studied label recovery attacks on federated learning systems in which clients send their local model updates to the server for aggregation. We developed RLU, a novel label recovery method which solves a least-square problem constructed by examining the correlation between the number of samples of each label type and local updates of the output layer. We extended the proposed framework to real-world scenarios involving well-trained models, multiple local epochs, high levels of data heterogeneity and various local objective functions, and provided theoretical analysis of RLU in different FL schemes. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets, three model architectures and six activation functions demonstrate consistently high accuracy, robustness and universality of RLU. Moreover, gradients inversion attack experiments illustrate that utilizing RLU may significantly improve quality of the reconstructed data in term of two widely-used metrics, PSNR and LPIPS. Future work will include exploring defense mechanism that may help ameliorate safety concerns caused by RLU.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n"

        "abstract": "\\vspace{-3mm}\nLearning expressive stochastic policies instead of deterministic ones has been proposed to achieve better stability, sample complexity, and robustness. Notably, in Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL), the policy is modeled as an expressive Energy-Based Model (EBM) over the Q-values. However, this formulation requires the estimation of the entropy of such EBMs, which is an open problem. To address this, previous MaxEnt RL methods either implicitly estimate the entropy, resulting in high computational complexity and variance (SQL), or follow a variational inference procedure that fits simplified actor distributions (\\eg Gaussian) for tractability (SAC). We propose \\underline{S}tein \\underline{S}oft \\underline{A}ctor-\\underline{C}ritic (\\STAC), a MaxEnt RL algorithm that learns expressive policies without compromising efficiency. Specifically, \\STAC\\ uses parameterized Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) as the underlying policy. We derive a closed-form expression of the entropy of such policies. Our formula is computationally efficient and only depends on first-order derivatives and vector products. Empirical results show that \\STAC\\ yields more optimal solutions to the MaxEnt objective than SQL and SAC in the multi-goal environment, and outperforms SAC and SQL on the MuJoCo benchmark",

We model agent behavior as the steady-state distribution of a parameterized reasoning Markov chain (RMC), optimized with a new tractable estimate of the policy gradient. We perform action selection by simulating the RMC for enough reasoning steps to approach its steady-state distribution. We show our framework has several useful properties that are inherently missing from traditional RL. For instance, it allows agent behavior to approximate any continuous distribution over actions by parameterizing the RMC with a simple Gaussian transition function. Moreover, the number of reasoning steps to reach convergence can scale adaptively with the difficulty of each action selection decision and can be accelerated by re-using past solutions. Our resulting algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in popular Mujoco and DeepMind Control benchmarks, both for proprioceptive and pixel-based tasks."

                "abstract": "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have shown compelling results in various tasks and applications in recent years. However, mode collapse remains a critical problem in GANs. In this paper, we propose a novel training pipeline to address the mode collapse issue of GANs. Different from existing methods, we propose to generalize the discriminator as feature embedding and maximize the entropy of distributions in the embedding space learned by the discriminator. Specifically, two regularization terms, i.e., Deep Local Linear Embedding (DLLE) and Deep Isometric feature Mapping (DIsoMap), are designed to encourage the discriminator to learn the structural information embedded in the data, such that the embedding space learned by the discriminator can be well-formed. Based on the well-learned embedding space supported by the discriminator, a non-parametric entropy estimator is designed to efficiently maximize the entropy of embedding vectors, playing as an approximation of maximizing the entropy of the generated distribution. By improving the discriminator and maximizing the distance of the most similar samples in the embedding space, our pipeline effectively reduces the mode collapse without sacrificing the quality of generated samples. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms the GAN baseline, MaF-GAN on CelebA (9.13 vs. 12.43 in FID) and surpasses the recent state-of-the-art energy-based model on the ANIME-FACE dataset (2.80 vs. 2.26 in Inception score).

However, when the goal space has discontinuities and the reward is sparse, a majority of goals are difficult to reach. In this context, a curriculum over goals helps agents learn by adapting training tasks to their current capabilities. In this work we propose Stein Variational Goal Generation (SVGG), which samples goals of intermediate difficulty for the agent, by leveraging a learned predictive model of its goal reaching capabilities. The distribution of goals is modeled with particles that are attracted in areas of appropriate difficulty using Stein Variational Gradient Descent. We show that SVGG outperforms state-of-the-art multi-goal Reinforcement Learning methods in terms of success coverage in hard exploration problems, and demonstrate that it is endowed with a useful recovery property when the environment changes."

                "abstract": "This paper studies the cooperative learning of two generative flow models, in which the two models are iteratively updated based on the jointly synthesized examples. The first flow model is a normalizing flow that transforms an initial simple density to a target density by applying a sequence of invertible transformations. The second flow model is a Langevin flow that runs finite steps of gradient-based MCMC toward an energy-based model. We start from proposing a generative framework that trains an energy-based model with a normalizing flow as an amortized sampler to initialize the MCMC chains of the energy-based model. In each learning iteration, we generate synthesized examples by using a normalizing flow initialization followed by a short-run Langevin flow revision toward the current energy-based model. Then we treat the synthesized examples as fair samples from the energy-based model and update the model parameters with the maximum likelihood learning gradient, while the normalizing flow directly learns from the synthesized examples by maximizing the tractable likelihood. Under the short-run non-mixing MCMC scenario, the estimation of the energy-based model is shown to follow the perturbation of maximum likelihood, and the short-run Langevin flow and the normalizing flow form a two-flow generator that we call CoopFlow. We provide an understating of the CoopFlow algorithm by information geometry and show that it is a valid generator as it converges to a moment matching estimator. We demonstrate that the trained CoopFlow is capable of synthesizing realistic images, reconstructing images, and interpolating between images."

Local optimization over the second term suggests that the curriculum should gradually expand the training tasks from easy to hard. Our VACL algorithm implements this variational paradigm with two practical components, task expansion and entity progression, which produces training curricula over both the task configurations as well as the number of entities in the task. Experiment results show that VACL solves a collection of sparse-reward problems with a large number of agents. Particularly, using a single desktop machine, VACL achieves 98% coverage rate with 100 agents in the simple-spread benchmark and reproduces the ramp-use behavior originally shown in OpenAI's hide-and-seek project.

                "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are predominantly evaluated by comparing their relative performance on a large suite of tasks. Most published results on deep RL benchmarks compare point estimates of aggregate performance such as mean and median scores across tasks, ignoring the statistical uncertainty implied by the use of a finite number of training runs. Beginning with the Arcade Learning Environment (ALE), the shift towards computationally-demanding benchmarks has led to the practice of evaluating only a small number of runs per task, exacerbating the statistical uncertainty in point estimates. In this paper, we argue that reliable evaluation in the few run deep RL regime cannot ignore the uncertainty in results without running the risk of slowing down progress in the field. We illustrate this point using a case study on the Atari 100k benchmark, where we find substantial discrepancies between conclusions drawn from point estimates alone versus a more thorough statistical analysis. With the aim of increasing the field's confidence in reported results with a handful of runs, we advocate for reporting interval estimates of aggregate performance and propose performance profiles to account for the variability in results, as well as present more robust and efficient aggregate metrics, such as interquartile mean scores, to achieve small uncertainty in results. Using such statistical tools, we scrutinize performance evaluations of existing algorithms on other widely used RL benchmarks including the ALE, Procgen, and the DeepMind Control Suite, again revealing discrepancies in prior comparisons. Our findings call for a change in how we evaluate performance in deep RL, for which we present a more rigorous evaluation methodology, accompanied with an open-source library rliable, to prevent unreliable results from stagnating the field."

Different from prior works that model such a distribution implicitly with a top-down latent variable model (e.g., generator), this paper proposes to explicitly represent the statistical distribution within a single natural image by using an energy-based generative framework, where a pyramid of energy functions, each parameterized by a bottom-up deep neural network, are used to capture the distributions of patches at different resolutions. Meanwhile, a coarse-to-fine sequential training and sampling strategy is presented to train the model efficiently. Besides learning to generate random samples from white noise, the model can learn in parallel with a self-supervised task (e.g., recover the input image from its corrupted version), which can further improve the descriptive power of the learned model. The proposed model is simple and natural in that it does not require an auxiliary model (e.g., discriminator) to assist the training. Besides, it also unifies internal statistics learning and image generation in a single framework. Experimental results presented on various image generation and manipulation tasks, including super-resolution, image editing, harmonization, style transfer, etc, have demonstrated the effectiveness of our model for internal learning."

We present a latent belief energy-based model (LB-EBM) for diverse human trajectory forecast. LB-EBM is a probabilistic model with cost function defined in the latent space to account for the movement history and social context. The low-dimensionality of the latent space and the high expressivity of the EBM make it easy for the model to capture the multi-modality of pedestrian trajectory distributions. LB-EBM is learned from expert demonstrations (i.e., human trajectories) projected into the latent space. Sampling from or optimizing the learned LB-EBM yields a belief vector which is used to make a path plan, which then in turn helps to predict a long-range trajectory. The effectiveness of LB-EBM and the two-step approach are supported by strong empirical results. Our model is able to make accurate, multi-modal, and social compliant trajectory predictions and improves over prior state-of-the-arts performance on the Stanford Drone trajectory prediction benchmark by 10.9% and on the ETH-UCY benchmark by 27.6%."

While this capability of MaxEnt RL has been observed empirically in prior work, to the best of our knowledge our work provides the first rigorous proof and theoretical characterization of the MaxEnt RL robust set. While a number of prior robust RL algorithms have been designed to handle similar disturbances to the reward function or dynamics, these methods typically require adding additional moving parts and hyperparameters on top of a base RL algorithm. In contrast, our theoretical results suggest that MaxEnt RL by itself is robust to certain disturbances, without requiring any additional modifications. While this does not imply that MaxEnt RL is the best available robust RL method, MaxEnt RL does possess a striking simplicity and appealing formal guarantees."

The use of generative cooperative network enables maximum likelihood learning of the domain model by MCMC teaching, where the energy-based model seeks to fit the data distribution of domain and distills its knowledge to the latent variable model via MCMC. Specifically, in the MCMC teaching process, the latent variable model parameterized by an encoder-decoder maps examples from the source domain to the target domain, while the energy-based model further refines the mapped results by Langevin revision such that the revised results match to the examples in the target domain in terms of the statistical properties, which are defined by the learned energy function. For the purpose of building up a correspondence between two unpaired domains, the proposed framework simultaneously learns a pair of cooperative networks with cycle consistency, accounting for a two-way translation between two domains, by alternating MCMC teaching. Experiments show that the proposed framework is useful for unsupervised image-to-image translation and unpaired image sequence translation."

However, it is non-trivial to sample from an EBM because of the difficulty of mixing between modes. In this paper, we propose to learn a variational auto-encoder (VAE) to initialize the finite-step MCMC, such as Langevin dynamics that is derived from the energy function, for efficient amortized sampling of the EBM. With these amortized MCMC samples, the EBM can be trained by maximum likelihood, which follows an \"analysis by synthesis\" scheme; while the VAE learns from these MCMC samples via variational Bayes. We call this joint training algorithm the variational MCMC teaching, in which the VAE chases the EBM toward data distribution. We interpret the learning algorithm as a dynamic alternating projection in the context of information geometry. Our proposed models can generate samples comparable to GANs and EBMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that our model can learn effective probabilistic distribution toward supervised conditional learning tasks."

Inspired by recent progress on diffusion probabilistic models, we present a diffusion recovery likelihood method to tractably learn and sample from a sequence of EBMs trained on increasingly noisy versions of a dataset. Each EBM is trained by maximizing the recovery likelihood: the conditional probability of the data at a certain noise level given their noisy versions at a higher noise level. The recovery likelihood objective is more tractable than the marginal likelihood objective, since it only requires MCMC sampling from a relatively concentrated conditional distribution. Moreover, we show that this estimation method is theoretically consistent: it learns the correct conditional and marginal distributions at each noise level, given sufficient data. After training, synthesized images can be generated efficiently by a sampling process that initializes from a spherical Gaussian distribution and progressively samples the conditional distributions at decreasingly lower noise levels. Our method generates high fidelity samples on various image datasets. On unconditional CIFAR-10 our method achieves FID 9.60 and inception score 8.58, superior to the majority of GANs. Moreover, we demonstrate that unlike previous work on EBMs, our long-run MCMC samples from the conditional distributions do not diverge and still represent realistic images, allowing us to accurately estimate the normalized density of data even for high-dimensional datasets."

To represent this sampler, we introduce a novel neural architecture, dynamics embedding, that generalizes Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo (HMC). The proposed approach inherits the flexibility of HMC while enabling tractable entropy estimation for the augmented model. By learning both a dual sampler and the primal model simultaneously, and sharing parameters between them, we obviate the requirement to design a separate sampling procedure once the model has been trained, leading to more effective learning. We show that many existing estimators, such as contrastive divergence, pseudo/composite-likelihood, score matching, minimum Stein discrepancy estimator, non-local contrastive objectives, noise-contrastive estimation, and minimum probability flow, are special cases of the proposed approach, each expressed by a different (fixed) dual sampler.

In this paper, we describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks, as well as real-world challenging tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements, SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance.

Key to our approach is a novel technique, doubly dual embedding, that avoids computation of the partition function. This technique also allows the development of a flexible sampling strategy that amortizes the cost of Monte-Carlo sampling in the inference stage. The resulting estimator can be easily generalized to kernel conditional exponential families. We establish a connection between kernel exponential family estimation and MMD-GANs, revealing a new perspective for understanding GANs. Compared to the score matching based estimators, the proposed method improves both memory and time efficiency while enjoying stronger statistical properties, such as fully capturing smoothness in its statistical convergence rate while the score matching estimator appears to saturate. Finally, we show that the proposed estimator empirically outperforms state-of-the-art"

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds."

Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been successful in a wide variety of simulated domains. However, a major obstacle facing deep RL in the real world is their high sample complexity. Batch policy gradient methods offer stable learning, but at the cost of high variance, which often requires large batches. TD-style methods, such as off-policy actor-critic and Q-learning, are more sample-efficient but biased, and often require costly hyperparameter sweeps to stabilize. In this work, we aim to develop methods that combine the stability of policy gradients with the efficiency of off-policy RL. We present Q-Prop, a policy gradient method that uses a Taylor expansion of the off-policy critic as a control variate. Q-Prop is both sample efficient and stable, and effectively combines the benefits of on-policy and off-policy methods. We analyze the connection between Q-Prop and existing model-free algorithms, and use control variate theory to derive two variants of Q-Prop with conservative and aggressive adaptation. We show that conservative Q-Prop provides substantial gains in sample efficiency over trust region policy optimization (TRPO) with generalized advantage estimation (GAE), and improves stability over deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), the state-of-the-art on-policy and off-policy methods, on OpenAI Gym's MuJoCo continuous control environments."

Both models are parametrized by convolutional neural networks (ConvNets). The first model is a deep energy-based model, whose energy function is defined by a bottom-up ConvNet, which maps the observed image to the energy. We call it the descriptor network. The second model is a generator network, which is a non-linear version of factor analysis. It is defined by a top-down ConvNet, which maps the latent factors to the observed image. The maximum likelihood learning algorithms of both models involve MCMC sampling such as Langevin dynamics. We observe that the two learning algorithms can be seamlessly interwoven into a cooperative learning algorithm that can train both models simultaneously. Specifically, within each iteration of the cooperative learning algorithm, the generator model generates initial synthesized examples to initialize a finite-step MCMC that samples and trains the energy-based descriptor model. After that, the generator model learns from how the MCMC changes its synthesized examples. That is, the descriptor model teaches the generator model by MCMC, so that the generator model accumulates the MCMC transitions and reproduces them by direct ancestral sampling. We call this scheme MCMC teaching. We show that the cooperative algorithm can learn highly realistic generative models."

Traditional numerical methods often work well, but some of the most interesting problems leave them stumped. Carleo and Troyer harnessed the power of machine learning to develop a variational approach to the quantum many-body problem (see the Perspective by Hush). The method performed at least as well as state-of-the-art approaches, setting a benchmark for a prototypical two-dimensional problem. With further development, it may well prove a valuable piece in the quantum toolbox. Science, this issue p. 602; see also p. 580 A machine-learning approach sets a computational benchmark for a prototypical two-dimensional problem. The challenge posed by the many-body problem in quantum physics originates from the difficulty of describing the nontrivial correlations encoded in the exponential complexity of the many-body wave function. Here we demonstrate that systematic machine learning of the wave function can reduce this complexity to a tractable computational form for some notable cases of physical interest. We introduce a variational representation of quantum states based on artificial neural networks with a variable number of hidden neurons. A reinforcement-learning scheme we demonstrate is capable of both finding the ground state and describing the unitary time evolution of complex interacting quantum systems.

We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations.

This algorithm is effective for optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters."

To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy. We demonstrate that deterministic policy gradient algorithms can significantly outperform their stochastic counterparts in high-dimensional action spaces."

These features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {\\epsilon} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation. We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps. Empirically, NUTS perform at least as efficiently as and sometimes more efficiently than a well tuned standard HMC method, without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {\\epsilon} on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used with no hand-tuning at all. NUTS is also suitable for applications such as BUGS-style automatic inference engines that require efficient \"turnkey\" sampling algorithms."

This seamless transition between optimization and Bayesian posterior sampling provides an inbuilt protection against overfitting.

A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for deciding on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using fast approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories from taking much computation time."

When class labels of training data are available, Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) has been widely used. However, the optimality of FDA is guaranteed only in a very restricted ideal circumstance, and it is often observed that FDA does not provide a good classification surface for many real problems. This letter treats the problem of supervised dimensionality reduction from the viewpoint of information theory and proposes a framework of dimensionality reduction based on class-conditional entropy minimization. The proposed linear dimensionality-reduction technique is validated both theoretically and experimentally. Then, through kernel Fisher discriminant analysis (KFDA), the multiple kernel learning problem is treated in the proposed framework, and a novel algorithm, which iteratively optimizes the parameters of the classification function and kernel combination coefficients, is proposed. The algorithm is experimentally shown to be comparable to or outperforms KFDA for large-scale benchmark data sets, and comparable to other multiple kernel learning techniques on the yeast protein function annotation task."

                "abstract": "With the goal to generate more scalable algorithms with higher efficiency and fewer open parameters, reinforcement learning (RL) has recently moved towards combining classical techniques from optimal control and dynamic programming with modern learning techniques from statistical estimation theory. In this vein, this paper suggests to use the framework of stochastic optimal control with path integrals to derive a novel approach to RL with parameterized policies. While solidly grounded in value function estimation and optimal control based on the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, policy improvements can be transformed into an approximation problem of a path integral which has no open algorithmic parameters other than the exploration noise. The resulting algorithm can be conceived of as model-based, semi-model-based, or even model free, depending on how the learning problem is structured. The update equations have no danger of numerical instabilities as neither matrix inversions nor gradient learning rates are required. Our new algorithm demonstrates interesting similarities with previous RL research in the framework of probability matching and provides intuition why the slightly heuristically motivated probability matching approach can actually perform well. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant performance improvements over gradient-based policy learning and scalability to high-dimensional control problems. Finally, a learning experiment on a simulated 12 degree-of-freedom robot dog illustrates the functionality of our algorithm in a complex robot learning scenario. We believe that Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2) offers currently one of the most efficient, numerically robust, and easy to implement algorithms for RL based on trajectory roll-outs."

We present a new algorithm for this approach which improves upon previous algorithms like iLQG. We consider a probabilistic model for which the maximum likelihood (ML) trajectory coincides with the optimal trajectory and which, in the LQG case, reproduces the classical SOC solution. The algorithm then utilizes approximate inference methods (similar to expectation propagation) that efficiently generalize to non-LQG systems.

Second, we show that the information theoretic measure estimates do not converge for k growing linearly with the number of samples. Nevertheless, these nonconvergent estimates can be used for solving the two-sample problem and assessing if two random variables are independent.

In this paper, we propose a novel actor-critic approach in which the policy of the actor is estimated through sequential Monte Carlo methods. The importance sampling step is performed on the basis of the values learned by the critic, while the resampling step modifies the actor's policy. The proposed approach has been empirically compared to other learning algorithms into several domains; in this paper, we report results obtained in a control problem consisting of steering a boat across a river."

An exponential transformation of the optimal value function makes the minimized Bellman equation linear. Apart from their theoretical significance, the new MDPs enable efficient approximations to traditional MDPs. Shortest path problems are approximated to arbitrary precision with largest eigenvalue problems, yielding an O (n) algorithm. Accurate approximations to generic MDPs are obtained via continuous embedding reminiscent of LP relaxation in integer programming.

As a result of the linearity, the usual backward computation can be replaced by a forward diffusion process that can be computed by stochastic integration or by the evaluation of a path integral. It is shown how in the deterministic limit the Pontryagin minimum principle formalism is recovered. The significance of the path integral approach is that it forms the basis for a number of efficient computational methods, such as Monte Carlo sampling, the Laplace approximation and the variational approximation.

First, we use an exact local expansion of the entropy function to prove almost sure consistency and central limit theorems for three of the most commonly used discretized information estimators. The setup is related to Grenander's method of sieves and places no assumptions on the underlying probability measure generating the data. Second, we prove a converse to these consistency theorems, demonstrating that a misapplication of the most common estimation techniques leads to an arbitrarily poor estimate of the true information, even given unlimited data. This inconsistency theorem leads to an analytical approximation of the bias, valid in surprisingly small sample regimes and more accurate than the usual formula of Miller and Madow over a large region of parameter space. The two most practical implications of these results are negative: (1) information estimates in a certain data regime are likely contaminated by bias, even if bias-corrected estimators are used, and (2) confidence intervals calculated by standard techniques drastically underestimate the error of the most common estimation methods. Finally, we note a very useful connection between the bias of entropy estimators and a certain polynomial approximation problem. By casting bias calculation problems in this approximation theory framework, we obtain the best possible generalization of known asymptotic bias results. More interesting, this framework leads to an estimator with some nice properties: the estimator comes equipped with rigorous bounds on the maximum error over all possible underlying probability distributions, and this maximum error turns out to be surprisingly small. We demonstrate the application of this new estimator on both real and simulated data."

We apply these irreversibility measures to experimental recordings of spontaneous hair-bundle oscillations in mechanosensory hair cells from the ear of the bullfrog. By analyzing the fluctuations of only the tip position of hair bundles, we reveal irreversibility in active oscillations and estimate an associated rate of entropy production of at least ∼3k B/s, on average. Applying thermodynamic uncertainty relations, we predict that measuring both the tip position of the hair bundle and the mechano-electrical transduction current that enters the hair cell leads to tighter lower bounds for the rate of entropy production, up to ∼103 k B/s in the oscillatory regime."

                "abstract": "In the pattern theoretical framework developed by Grenander and advocated by Mumford for computer vision and pattern recognition, different patterns are represented by statistical generative models. The FRAME (Filters, Random fields, And Maximum Entropy) model is such a generative model for texture patterns. It is a Markov random field model (or a Gibbs distribution, or an energy-based model) of stationary spatial processes. The log probability density function of the model (or the energy function of the Gibbs distribution) is the sum of translation-invariant potential functions that are one-dimensional non-linear transformations of linear filter responses. In this paper, we review two generalizations of this model. One is a sparse FRAME model for non-stationary patterns such as objects, where the potential functions are location specific, and they are non-zero only at a selected collection of locations. The other generalization is a deep FRAME model where the filters are defined by a convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet). This leads to a deep convolutional energy-based model. The local modes of the energy function satisfies an auto-encoder which we call the Hopfield auto-encoder. The model can be learned by an “analysis by synthesis” algorithm that iterates a sampling step for synthesis and a learning step for analysis. The algorithm admits an adversarial interpretation where the learning step and sampling step play a minimax game based on a value function. We can recruit a generator model as a direct and approximate sampler of the deep energy-based model to speed up the sampling step, and the two models can be learned simultaneously by a cooperative learning algorithm."

This framework has several intriguing properties. First, the optimal policies are stochastic, improving exploration and preventing convergence to local optima, particularly when the objective is multimodal. Second, the entropy term provides regularization, resulting in more consistent and robust learning when compared to deterministic methods. Third, maximum entropy policies are composable, that is, two or more policies can be combined, and the resulting policy can be shown to be approximately optimal for the sum of the constituent task rewards. And fourth, the view of maximum entropy RL as probabilistic inference provides a foundation for building hierarchical policies that can solve complex and sparse reward tasks. In the first part, we will devise new algorithms based on this framework, starting from soft Q-learning that learns expressive energy-based policies, to soft actor-critic that provides simplicity and convenience of actor-critic methods, and ending with automatic temperature adjustment scheme that practically eliminates the need for hyperparameter tuning, which is a crucial feature for real-world applications where tuning of hyperparameters can be prohibitively expensive. In the second part, we will discuss extensions enabled by the inherent stochasticity of maximum entropy polices, including compositionality and hierarchical learning. We will demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on both simulated and real-world robotic manipulation and locomotion tasks."

In this thesis, we introduce the principle of maximum causal entropy, a general technique for applying information theory to decision-theoretic, game-theoretic, and control settings where relevant information is sequentially revealed over time. This approach guarantees decision-theoretic performance by matching purposeful measures of behavior (Abbeel & Ng, 2004), and/or enforces game-theoretic rationality constraints (Aumann, 1974), while otherwise being as uncertain as possible, which minimizes worst-case predictive log-loss (Grunwald & Dawid, 2003). \nWe derive probabilistic models for decision, control, and multi-player game settings using this approach. We then develop corresponding algorithms for efficient inference that include relaxations of the Bellman equation (Bellman, 1957), and simple learning algorithms based on convex optimization. We apply the models and algorithms to a number of behavior prediction tasks. Specifically, we present empirical evaluations of the approach in the domains of vehicle route preference modeling using over 100,000 miles of collected taxi driving data, pedestrian motion modeling from weeks of indoor movement data, and robust prediction of game play in stochastic multi-player games."

                "\n\n\n\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\n\\input{figures/teaser2}\nMaxEnt RL \\citep{todorov2006linearly,ziebart2010modeling,haarnoja2017reinforcement,kappen2005path,toussaint2009robot,theodorou2010generalized,abdolmaleki2018maximum,haarnoja2018soft,vieillard2020munchausen} has been proposed to address challenges hampering the deployment of RL to real-world applications, including stability, sample efficiency ~\\citep{gu2017q}, and robustness \\citep{eysenbach2022maximum}. Instead of learning a deterministic policy, as in classical RL \\citep{sutton1999policy,schulman2017proximal,silver2014deterministic, lillicrap2015continuous}, MaxEnt RL learns a stochastic policy that captures the intricacies of the action space. This enables better exploration during training and eventually better robustness to environmental perturbations at test time, \\ie the agent learns multimodal action space distributions which enables picking the next best action in case a perturbation prevents the execution of the optimal one. To achieve this, MaxEnt RL models the policy using the expressive family of EBMs \\citep{lecun2006tutorial}. This translates into learning policies that maximize the sum of expected future reward and expected future entropy. However, estimating the entropy of such complex distributions remains an open problem. \n\nTo address this, existing approaches either use tricks to go around the entropy computation or make limiting assumptions on the policy. This results in either poor scalability or convergence to suboptimal solutions. For example, SQL \\citep{haarnoja2017reinforcement} implicitly incorporates entropy in the Q-function computation. This requires using importance sampling, which results in high variability and hence poor training stability and limited scalability to high dimensional action spaces. SAC \\citep{haarnoja2018soft}, on the other hand, follows a variational inference procedure by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the EBM policy. This enables a closed-form evaluation of the entropy but results in a suboptimal solution. For instance, SAC fails in environments characterized by multimodal action distributions. Similar to SAC, IAPO \\citep{marino2021iterative} models the policy as a uni-modal Gaussian. Instead of optimizing a MaxEnt objective, it achieves multimodal policies by learning a collection of parameter estimates (mean, variance) through different initializations for different policies. To improve the expressiveness of SAC, SSPG \\citep{cetin2022policy} and SAC-NF \\citep{mazoure2020leveraging} model the policy as a Markov chain with Gaussian transition probabilities and as a normalizing flow \\citep{rezende2015variational}, respectively. However, due to training stability issues, the reported results in \\cite{cetin2022policy} show that though both models learn multi-modal policies, they fail to maximize the expected future entropy in positive rewards setups.\n\n\n\\input{figures/teaser}\n\nWe conduct extensive empirical evaluations of \\STAC\\ from three aspects. We start with a sanity check on the merit of our derived SVGD-based entropy estimate on target distributions with known entropy values (\\eg Gaussian) or log-likelihoods (\\eg Gaussian Mixture Models) and assess its sensitivity to different SVGD parameters (kernel, initial distribution, number of steps and number of particles). We observe that its performance depends on the choice of the kernel and is robust to variations of the remaining parameters. In particular, we find out that the kernel should be chosen to guarantee inter-dependencies between the particles, which turns out to be essential for invertibility. Next, we assess the performance of \\STAC\\ on a multi-goal environment \\citep{haarnoja2017reinforcement} where different goals are associated with the same positive (maximum) expected future reward but different (maximum) expected future entropy. We show that \\STAC\\ learns multimodal policies and effectively maximizes the entropy, leading to better robustness to obstacles placed at test time. Finally, we test \\STAC\\ on the MuJoCo benchmark \\citep{duan2016benchmarking}. \\STAC\\ yields better performances than the baselines on four out of the five environments. Moreover, \\STAC\\ shows higher sample efficiency as it tends to converge with fewer training steps. These results were obtained from running SVGD for only three steps, which results in a small overhead compared to SAC during training. Furthermore, to maximize the run-time efficiency during testing, we train an amortized SVGD version of the policy to mimic the SVGD-based policy. Hence, this reduces inference to a forward pass through the policy network without compromising the performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

                "Preliminaries",
                "\\subsection{Samplers for Energy-based Models}\\label{sec:ebm_samplers}\nIn this work, we study three representative methods for sampling from EBMs: (1) Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) \\& Deterministic Langevin Dynamics (DLD)~\\citep{welling2011bayesian}, (2) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)~\\citep{neal2011mcmc}, and (3) Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)~\\citep{liu2016stein}. \nSVGD is a particle-based Bayesian inference algorithm. Compared to SGLD and HMC which have a single particle in their dynamics, SVGD operates on a set of particles. Specifically, SVGD samples a set of $m$  particles $\\{a_j\\}_{j=1}^m$ from an initial distribution $q^{0}$ which it then transforms through a sequence of updates to fit the target distribution. Formally, at every iteration $l$, SVGD applies a form of functional gradient descent $\\Delta f$ that minimizes the KL-divergence between the target distribution $p$ and the proposal distribution $q^{l}$ induced by the particles, \\ie the update rule for the $i^{\\text{th}}$ particles is: $a^{l+1}_{i} = a^{l}_{i} + \\epsilon \\Delta f(a_{i}^{l})$ with \n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:svgd_update}\n\\Delta f(a_{i}^{l}) = \\mathbb{E}_{a_{j}^l\\sim q^l}\\big[ k(a^{l}_{i},a^{l}_{j})\\nabla_{a^{l}_j}\\log p(a^{l}_{j}) + \\nabla_{a^{l}_{j}}k(a^{l}_i,a^{l}_j)\\big] .\n\\end{equation} \nHere, $\\epsilon$ is the step size and $k(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the kernel function, \\eg the RBF kernel: \n$k(a_i,a_j) = \\exp(||a_i -a_j||^2/2 \\sigma^2)$. \nThe first term within the gradient drives the particles toward the high probability regions of $p$, while the second term serves as a repulsive force to encourage dispersion. \n\\subsection{Maximum-Entropy RL}\nWe consider an infinite horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by a tuple $(\\cS,\\cA,p,r)$, where $\\cS$ is the state space, $\\cA$ is the action space and $p: \\cS \\times \\cA \\times \\cS \\rightarrow [0,\\infty]$ is the state transition probability modeling the density of the next state $s_{t+1} \\in \\cS$ given the current state $s_t \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and action $a_t \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Additionally, we assume that the environment emits a bounded reward function $r \\in [r_{\\text{min}}, r_{\\text{max}}]$ at every iteration. We use $\\rho_{\\pi}(s_t)$ and $\\rho_{\\pi}(s_t, a_t)$ to denote the state and state-action marginals of the trajectory distribution induced by a policy $\\pi (a_t | s_t)$. We consider the setup of continuous action spaces \\cite{lazaric2007reinforcement,lee2018deep,zhou2023single}. MaxEnt RL~\\citep{todorov2006linearly,ziebart2010modeling,rawlik2012stochastic} learns a policy $\\pi^{*}(a_t|s_t)$,  that instead of maximizing the expected future reward, maximizes the sum of the expected future reward and entropy:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:max_entr_obj}\n\\pi^{*}= \\argmax\\nolimits_{\\pi}  \\sum\\nolimits_t \\gamma^t \\mathbb{E}_{(s_t,a_t)\\sim \\rho_{\\pi}} \\big[ r(s_t,a_t) + \\alpha \\mathcal{H}(\\pi(\\cdot|s_t))\\big],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a temperature parameter controlling the stochasticity of the policy and $\\mathcal{H}(\\pi(\\cdot|s_t))$ is the entropy of the policy at state $s_t$. The conventional RL objective can be recovered for $\\alpha=0$\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:ebm}\n\\pi^{*} = \\argmin\\nolimits_{\\pi} \\sum\\nolimits_t \\mathbb{E}_{s_t \\sim \\rho_\\pi}\\big[ D_{K\\!L}\\big(\\pi(\\cdot|s_t) \\| \\exp\\!{(  Q(s_t,\\cdot)/\\alpha )}/Z \\big)\\big],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $D_{KL}$ is the KL-divergence and $Z$ is the normalizing constant. We now review two landmark MaxEnt RL algorithms: SAC \\citep{haarnoja2018soft} and SQL \\citep{haarnoja2017reinforcement}.\n\n\\textbf{SAC} is an actor-critic algorithm that alternates between policy evaluation, \\ie evaluating the Q-values for a policy $\\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)$:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:sac_pe}\nQ_{\\phi}(s_t,a_t) \\leftarrow r(s_t,a_t)+ \\gamma\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}\\nolimits_{s_{t+1},a_{t+1}\\sim \\rho_{\\pi_{\\theta}}}\\big[ Q_{\\phi}(s_{t+1},a_{t+1}) + \\alpha  \\cH(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s_{t+1}))  \\big]\n\\end{equation} %\\rho(s',a')\nand policy improvement, \\ie using the updated Q-values to compute a better policy:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:sac_pi}\n\\pi_{\\theta}= \\argmax\\nolimits_{\\theta} \\sum\\nolimits_t \\mathop{\\mathbb{E}_{s_t,a_t \\sim \\rho_{\\pi_{\\theta}} } } \\big[ Q_{\\phi}(a_t,s_t) + \\alpha \\cH(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s_t) )  \\big].\n\\end{equation}\nSAC models $\\pi_{\\theta}$ as an isotropic Gaussian, \\ie $\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot |s ) = \\cN(\\mu_{\\theta}, \\sigma_{\\theta}I)$.  While this enables computing a closed-form expression of the entropy, it incurs an over-simplification of the true action distribution, and thus cannot represent complex distributions, \\eg multimodal distributions.\n\n\\textbf{SQL} goes around the entropy computation, by defining a soft version of the value function $V_{\\phi}=\\alpha \\log \\big(  \\int_{\\cA} \\exp\\big( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} Q_{\\phi}(s_t,a')  \\big) da' \\big)$. This enables expressing the Q-value (Eq~\\eqref{eq:sac_pe}) independently from the entropy, \\ie $Q_{\\phi}(s_t,a_t)=r(s_t,a_t)+\\gamma \\E_{s_{t+1}\\sim p}[V_{\\phi}(s_{t+1})]$. Hence, SQL follows a soft value iteration which alternates between the updates of the ``soft'' versions of $Q$ and value functions:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:sql_q}&Q_{\\phi}(s_t,a_t) \\leftarrow r(s_t,a_t)+\\gamma \\E_{s_{t+1}\\sim p}[V_{\\phi}(s_{t+1})], \\ \\forall (s_t, a_t)  \\\\\n\\label{eq:sql_v}&V_{\\phi}(s_t) \\leftarrow  \\alpha \\log \\big(  \\int_{\\cA} \\exp\\big( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} Q_{\\phi}(s_t,a')  \\big) da' \\big), \\ \\forall s_t.\n\\end{eqnarray} \nOnce the $Q_{\\phi}$ and $V_{\\phi}$ functions converge, SQL uses amortized SVGD~\\cite{wang2016learning} to learn a stochastic sampling network $f_{\\theta}( \\xi, s_t )$ that maps noise samples $\\xi$ into the action samples from the EBM policy distribution $\\pi^{*}(a_t|s_t)= \\exp \\big( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} ( Q^{*}(s_t,a_t) - V^{*}(s_t))\\big)$. The parameters $\\theta$ are obtained by minimizing the loss $ J_{\\theta}(s_t) = D_{K\\!L} \\big( \\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s_t)|| \\exp\\!{ \\big(\\frac{1}{\\alpha} (Q^{*}_{\\phi}(s_t,\\cdot)-V^{*}_{\\phi}(s_t)}) \\big)$ with respect to $\\theta$. Here, $\\pi_{\\theta}$ denotes the policy induced by $f_{\\theta}$. SVGD is designed to minimize such KL-divergence without explicitly computing $\\pi_{\\theta}$. In particular, SVGD provides the most greedy direction as a functional $\\Delta f_{\\theta}(\\cdot,s_t)$ (Eq~\\eqref{eq:svgd_update}) which can be used to approximate the gradient $\\partial J_{\\theta}/\\partial a_t$. Hence, the gradient of the loss $J_\\theta$ with respect to $\\theta$ is: $\\partial J_{\\theta}(s_t)/\\partial \\theta \\propto \\E_{\\xi} \\big[ \\Delta f_{\\theta}(\\xi, s_t)  \\partial f_{\\theta}(\\xi, s_t)/\\partial \\theta \\big]$. Note that the integral in Eq~\\eqref{eq:sql_v} is approximated via importance sampling, which is known to result in high variance estimates and hence poor scalability to high dimensional action spaces. Moreover, amortized generation is usually unstable and prone to mode collapse, an issue similar to GANs. Therefore, SQL is outperformed by SAC~\\cite{haarnoja2018soft} on benchmark tasks like MuJoCo.\n\n\n"

                "Approach",
                "We introduce \\STAC, a new actor-critic MaxEnt RL algorithm that uses SVGD as the underlying actor to generate action samples from policies represented using EBMs. This choice is motivated by the expressivity of distributions that can be fitted via SVGD. Additionally, we show that we can derive a closed-form entropy estimate of the SVGD-induced distribution, thanks to the invertibility of the update rule, which does not necessarily hold for other EBM samplers. Besides, we propose a parameterized version of SVGD to enable scalability to high-dimensional action spaces and non-smooth Q-function landscapes. \\STAC\\ is hence capable of learning a more optimal solution to the MaxEnt RL objective (Eq~\\eqref{eq:max_entr_obj}) as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:multi-goal-teaser}.\n\\subsection{Stein Soft Actor Critic}\nLike SAC, \\STAC\\ performs soft policy iteration which alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement. The difference is that we model the actor as a \\textit{parameterized sampler from an EBM}. Hence, the policy distribution corresponds to an expressive EBM as opposed to a Gaussian. \n\n\\textbf{Critic.} The critic's parameters $\\phi$ are obtained by minimizing the Bellman loss as traditionally:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\phi^{*} = \\argmin\\nolimits_{\\phi}\\E_{(s_t,a_t) \\sim \\rho_{\\pi_{\\theta}}} \\left[ (Q_{\\phi}(s_t,a_t) - \\hat{y})^2  \\right],\n\\label{eq:critic_update}\n\\end{equation} \nwith the target $\\hat{y}\n= r_{t}(s_t,a_t) + \\gamma \\E_{(s_{t+1},a_{t+1}) \\sim \\rho_{\\pi}} \\left[Q_{\\bar{\\phi}}(s_{t+1},a_{t+1}) + \\alpha\\mathcal{H}(  \\pi(\\cdot|s_{t+1}))\\right].$\nHere $\\bar{\\phi}$ is an exponentially moving average of the value\nnetwork weights \\citep{mnih2015human}. \n\n\\textbf{Actor as an EBM sampler.} The actor is modeled as a sampler from an EBM over the Q-values. To generate a set of valid actions, the actor first samples a set of particles $\\{a^{0}\\}$ from an initial distribution $q^{0}$ (\\eg Gaussian). These particles are then updated over several iterations $l \\in [1,L]$, \\ie $\\{a^{l+1}\\} \\leftarrow \\{a^{l}\\} + \\epsilon h(\\{a^{l}\\},s)$ following the sampler dynamics characterized by a transformation $h$ (\\eg for SVGD, $h=\\Delta f$ in Eq~\\eqref{eq:svgd_update}). If $q^{0}$ is tractable and $h$ is invertible, it's possible to compute a closed-form expression of the distribution of the particles at the $l^{\\text{th}}$ iteration via the change of variable formula \\cite{devore2012modern}: $q^{l}( a^{l}|s ) = q^{l-1}( a^{l-1}|s )\\left|\\det (I + \\epsilon \\nabla_{a^l} h(a^{l},s)) \\right|^{-1}, \\forall l \\in[1,L]$. In this case, the policy is represented using the particle distribution at the final step $L$ of the sampler dynamics, \\ie $\\pi(a|s)= q^{L}(a^L|s)$ and the entropy can be estimated by averaging $\\log q^{L}(a^L|s)$ over a set of particles (Section \\ref{sec:entropy}). We study the invertibility of popular EBM samplers in Section \\ref{sec:invertible_policies}. \n\\input{figures/fig_actor} \n\\textbf{Parameterized initialization.} To reduce the number of steps required to converge to the target distribution (hence reducing computation cost), we further propose modeling the initial distribution as a parameterized isotropic Gaussian, \\ie $a^0\\sim\\cN(\\mu_{\\theta}(s),\\sigma_{\\theta}(s))$. The parameterization trick is then used to express $a^{0}$ as a function of $\\theta$. Intuitively, the actor would learn $\\theta$ such that the initial distribution is close to the target distribution. Hence, fewer steps are required to converge, as illustrated in \\Figref{fig:actor}. Note that if the number of steps $L=0$, \\STAC\\ is reduced to SAC. Besides, to deal with the non-smooth nature of deep Q-function landscapes which might lead to particle divergence in the sampling process, we bound the particle updates to be within a few standard deviations ($t$) from the mean of the learned initial distribution, \\ie $-t\\sigma_{\\theta} \\leq a_{\\theta}^{l} \\leq t\\sigma_{\\theta}$, $\\forall l \\in [1,L]$. Eventually, the initial distribution $q_{\\theta}^{0}$ learns to contour the high-density region of the target distribution and the following updates refine it by converging to the spanned modes. Formally, the parameters $\\theta$ are computed by minimizing the expected KL-divergence between the policy $q_{\\theta}^L$ induced by the particles from the sampler and the EBM of the Q-values:\n\\begin{align} \n\\theta^{*} \\!=\\! &\\argmax\\nolimits_{\\theta}\\!  \\E_{s_t \\sim \\cD,  a_{\\theta}^L \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}} \\left[ Q_{\\phi}(s_t, a_{\\theta}^L) \\right] + \\alpha  \\E_{s_t \\sim \\cD} \\left[  \\mathcal{H}( \\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s_t) ) \\right] \\nonumber\\\\\n\\text{s.t. } &-t\\sigma_{\\theta} \\leq a_{\\theta}^{l} \\leq t\\sigma_{\\theta}, \\quad \\forall l \\in [1,L] .\n\\label{eq:actor_loss}\n\\end{align}\nHere, $\\cD$ is the replay buffer. Note that the constraint does not truncate the particles as it is not an invertible transformation which then violates the assumptions of the change of variable formula. Instead, we sample more particles than we need and select the ones that stay within the range. We call \\STAC($\\phi,\\theta$) and \\STAC($\\phi$) as two versions of  \\STAC\\ with/without the parameterized initial distribution. \n\n\n\\subsection{A Closed-Form Expression of the Policy's Entropy}\n\\label{sec:entropy}\nA critical challenge in MaxEnt RL is how to efficiently compute the entropy term $\\mathcal{H}(\\pi(\\cdot|s_{t+1}))$\nin Eq~\\eqref{eq:max_entr_obj}. We show that, if we model the policy as an iterative sampler from the EBM, under certain conditions, we can derive a closed-form estimate of the entropy at convergence. \n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:generic_entropy}\nLet $F:\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be an invertible transformation of the form $F(a) = a + \\epsilon h(a) $. We denote by $q^L(a^L)$ the distribution obtained from repeatedly applying $F$ to a set of samples $\\{a^{0}\\}$ from an initial distribution $q^{0}(a^0)$ over $L$ steps, \\ie $a^{L} = F \\circ F \\circ \\cdots \\circ F(a^{0})$. Under the condition $ \\epsilon ||\\nabla_{a^{l}_{i} } h(a_i)||_{\\infty} \\ll 1 $, $\\forall l \\in [1,L]$,\nthe distribution of the particles at the $L^{\\text{th}}$ step is:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:generic_entropy}\n\\log q^{L}(a^L) \\approx \\log q^0(a^0) - \\epsilon \\sum\\nolimits_{l = 0}^{L-1}  \\, \\Tr(\\nabla_{a^{l}} h(a^{l})) + \\cO(\\epsilon^2 dL).\n\\end{equation}\nHere, $d$ is the dimensionality of $a$, \\ie $a\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\\cO(\\epsilon^2 dL)$ is the order of approximation error.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\proofsketch{\n\n~\\eqref{eq:generic_entropy}.} Note that the condition $ \\epsilon ||\\nabla_{a_i} h(a_i)||_{\\infty} \\ll 1 $ can always be satisfied when we choose a sufficiently small step size $\\epsilon$, \\textit{or} the gradient of $h(a)$ is small, \\ie $h(a)$ is Lipschitz continuous with a sufficiently small constant. \\\\\nIt follows from the theorem above, that the entropy of a policy modeled as an EBM sampler (Eq~\\eqref{eq:actor_loss}) can be expressed analytically as:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:closed_form_entropy}\n\\mathcal{H}(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s))\\!=\\! -\\mathbb{E}_{a_{\\theta}^{0}\\sim q_{\\theta}^{0}}\\Big[\\log q_{\\theta}^{L}(a_{\\theta}^{L} |s)\\Big]\\!\\approx\\!-\\mathbb{E}_{a_{\\theta}^{0}\\sim q_{\\theta}^{0} }\\Big[\\!\\log q_{\\theta}^{0}(a^{0}|s)\\!-\\!\\epsilon\\!\\sum\\nolimits_{l = 0}^{L-1} \\Tr\\!\\Big(\\!\\nabla_{a_{\\theta}^{l}}\\!h(a_{\\theta}^{l},s)\\!\\Big)\\!\\Big].\n\\end{equation}\nIn the following, we drop the dependency of the action on $\\theta$ for simplicity of the notation.\n\\subsection{Invertible Policies}\n\\label{sec:invertible_policies}\nNext, we study the invertibility of three popular EBM samplers: SVGD, SGLD, and HMC as well as the efficiency of computing the trace, \\ie $\\Tr(\\nabla_{a^l} h(a^{l}, s))$ in Eq~\\eqref{eq:generic_entropy} for the ones that are invertible.\n\\begin{proposition}[SVGD invertibility]\\label{prop:svgd_invertibility}\n Given the SVGD learning rate $\\epsilon$ and RBF kernel $k(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ with variance $\\sigma$, if $\\epsilon \\ll \\sigma $, the update rule of SVGD dynamics defined in Eq~\\eqref{eq:svgd_update} is invertible.\n\\end{proposition}\n\\proofsketch{We use the explicit function theorem to show that the Jacobian $\\nabla_{a} F(a,s)$ of the update rule $F(a,s)$ is diagonally dominated and hence invertible.

While the HMC update is invertible, its derived closed-form entropy involves calculating Hessian and hence computationally more expensive. Due to these considerations, we choose to use SVGD with an RBF kernel as the underlying sampler of \\STAC.\n\n\n"

To achieve this, it maximizes the sum of expected future reward and expected future entropy. It is different from entropy regularization~\\citep{schulman2015trust,o2016combining,schulman2017proximal} which maximizes entropy at the current time step. It is also different from multi-modal RL approaches \\citep{tang2018boosting} which recover different modes with equal frequencies without considering their future entropy. MaxEnt RL has been broadly incorporated in various RL domains, including inverse RL~\\citep{ziebart2008maximum,finn2016guided}, stochastic control~\\citep{rawlik2012stochastic,toussaint2009robot}, guided policy search~\\citep{levine2013guided}, and off-policy learning~\\citep{haarnoja2018soft,haarnoja2018soft1}. MaxEnt RL is shown to maximize a lower bound of the robust RL objective~\\citep{eysenbach2022maximum} and is hence less sensitive to perturbations in state and reward functions. From the variational inference lens, MaxEnt RL aims to find the policy distribution that minimizes the \\textit{KL}-divergence to an EBM over Q-function. The desired family of variational distributions is (1) expressive enough to capture the intricacies of the Q-value landscape (\\eg multimodality) and (2) has a tractable entropy estimate. These two requirements are hard to satisfy. SAC~\\citep{haarnoja2018soft} uses a Gaussian policy. Despite having a tractable entropy, it fails to capture arbitrary Q-value landscapes. SAC-GMM~\\citep{haarnoja2018acquiring} extends SAC by modeling the policy as a Gaussian Mixture Model, but it requires an impractical grid search over the number of components. Other extensions include IAPO \\citep{marino2021iterative} which also models the policy as a uni-modal Gaussian but learns a collection of parameter estimates (mean, variance) through different initializations. While this yields multi-modality, it does not optimize a MaxEnt objective. SSPG \\citep{cetin2022policy} and SAC-NF \\citep{mazoure2020leveraging} respectively improve the policy expressivity by modeling the policy as a Markov chain with Gaussian transition probabilities and as a normalizing flow. Due to training instability, the reported multi-goal experiments in \\citep{cetin2022policy} show that, though both models capture multimodality, they fail to maximize the expected future entropy in positive reward setups. SQL \\citep{haarnoja2017reinforcement}, on the other hand, bypasses the explicit entropy computation altogether via a soft version of value iteration. It then trains an amortized SVGD \\citep{wang2016learning} sampler from the EBM over the learned Q-values. However, estimating soft value functions requires approximating integrals via importance sampling which is known to have high variance and poor scalability. We propose a new family of variational distributions induced by a parameterized SVGD sampler from the EBM over Q-values. Our policy is expressive and captures multi-modal distributions while being characterized by a tractable entropy estimate. \\\\\n\\textbf{EBMs} \\citep{lecun2006tutorial,wu2018sparse} are represented as Gibbs densities $p(x) = \\exp{E(x)}/Z$, where $E(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is an energy function describing inter-variable dependencies and $Z= \\int \\exp{E(x)}$ is the partition function. Despite their expressiveness, EBMs are not tractable as the partition function requires integrating over an exponential number of configurations. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods \\citep{van2018simple} (\\eg HMC~\\citep{hoffman2014no}, SGLD~\\citep{welling2011bayesian}) are frequently used to approximate the partition function via sampling. There have been recent efforts to parameterize these samplers via deepnets \\citep{levy2017generalizing,gong2018meta,feng2017learning} to improve scalability. Similarly to these methods, we propose a parameterized variant of SVGD \\citep{liu2016stein} as an EBM sampler to enable scalability to high-dimensional action spaces. Beyond sampling, we derive a closed-form expression of the sampling distribution as an estimate of the EBM. This yields a tractable estimate of the entropy. This is opposed to previous methods for estimating EBM entropy which mostly rely on heuristic approximation, lower bounds \\cite{dai2017calibrating,dai2019kernel}, or neural estimators of mutual information \\citep{kumar2018engan}. The idea of approximating the entropy of EBMs via MCMC sampling by leveraging the change of variable formula was first proposed in \\cite{dai2019exponential}. The authors apply the formula to HMC and LD, which, as we show previously, violate the invertibility assumption. To go around this, they augment the EBM family with the noise or velocity variable for LD and HMC respectively. We show that SVGD is invertible, and hence we sample from the original EBM, so that our derived entropy is more intuitive as it depends on the SVGD dynamics.\\\\\n\\textbf{SVGD-augmented RL} \\citep{liu2016stein} has been explored under other RL contexts. \\citet{liu2017steinn} use SVGD to learn a distribution over policy parameters. While this leads to learning diverse policies, it is fundamentally different from our approach as we are interested in learning a single multi-modal policy with a closed-form entropy formula. \\citet{castanet2023stein, chen2021variational} use SVGD to sample from multimodal distributions over goals/tasks. We go beyond sampling and use SVGD to derive a closed-form entropy formula of an expressive variational distribution.\n\n\n"

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: high sample complexity and brittleness to hyperparameters. Both of these challenges limit the applicability of such methods to real-world domains. In this paper, we describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks, as well as real-world challenging tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements, SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving similar performance across different random seeds. These results suggest that SAC is a promising candidate for learning in real-world robotics tasks.\n@article{haarnoja2018soft1,\n  title={Soft actor-critic algorithms and applications},\n  author={Haarnoja, Tuomas and Zhou, Aurick and Hartikainen, Kristian and Tucker, George and Ha, Sehoon and Tan, Jie and Kumar, Vikash and Zhu, Henry and Gupta, Abhishek and Abbeel, Pieter and others},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1812.05905},\n  year={2018}\n}\nAbstract: This paper considers linear-quadratic control of a non-linear dynamical system subject to arbitrary cost. I show that for this class of stochastic control problems the non-linear Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation can be transformed into a linear equation. The transformation is similar to the transformation used to relate the classical Hamilton–Jacobi equation to the Schrödinger equation. As a result of the linearity, the usual backward computation can be replaced by a forward diffusion process that can be computed by stochastic integration or by the evaluation of a path integral. It is shown how in the deterministic limit the Pontryagin minimum principle formalism is recovered. The significance of the path integral approach is that it forms the basis for a number of efficient computational methods, such as Monte Carlo sampling, the Laplace approximation and the variational approximation. We show the effectiveness of the first two methods in a number of examples. Examples are given that show the qualitative difference between stochastic and deterministic control and the occurrence of symmetry breaking as a function of the noise.\n@article{kappen2005path,\n  title={Path integrals and symmetry breaking for optimal control theory},\n  author={Kappen, Hilbert J},\n  journal={JSTAT},\n  year={2005},\n  publisher={IOP Publishing}\n}\n\nAbstract: We propose a method for learning expressive energy-based policies for continuous states and actions, which has been feasible only in tabular domains before. We apply our method to learning maximum entropy policies, resulting into a new algorithm, called soft Q-learning, that expresses the optimal policy via a Boltzmann distribution. We use the recently proposed amortized Stein variational gradient descent to learn a stochastic sampling network that approximates samples from this distribution. The benefits of the proposed algorithm include improved exploration and compositionality that allows transferring skills between tasks, which we confirm in simulated experiments with swimming and walking robots. We also draw a connection to actor-critic methods, which can be viewed performing approximate inference on the corresponding energy-based model.\n@inproceedings{haarnoja2017reinforcement,\n  title={Reinforcement learning with deep energy-based policies},\n  author={Haarnoja, Tuomas and Tang, Haoran and Abbeel, Pieter and Levine, Sergey},\n  booktitle={ICML},\n  year={2017}\n}\n\n@article{zhou2023single,\n  title={Single timescale actor-critic method to solve the linear quadratic regulator with convergence guarantees},\n  author={Zhou, Mo and Lu, Jianfeng},\n  journal={JMLR},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\nAbstract: Learning in real-world domains often requires to deal with continuous state and action spaces. Although many solutions have been proposed to apply Reinforcement Learning algorithms to continuous state problems, the same techniques can be hardly extended to continuous action spaces, where, besides the computation of a good approximation of the value function, a fast method for the identification of the highest-valued action is needed. In this paper, we propose a novel actor-critic approach in which the policy of the actor is estimated through sequential Monte Carlo methods. The importance sampling step is performed on the basis of the values learned by the critic, while the resampling step modifies the actor's policy. The proposed approach has been empirically compared to other learning algorithms into several domains; in this paper, we report results obtained in a control problem consisting of steering a boat across a river.\n@article{lazaric2007reinforcement,\n  title={Reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces through sequential monte carlo methods},\n  author={Lazaric, Alessandro and Restelli, Marcello and Bonarini, Andrea},\n  journal={NeurIPS},\n  year={2007}\n}\n\nAbstract: The choice of approximate posterior distribution is one of the core problems in variational inference. Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.\n@inproceedings{rezende2015variational,\n  title={Variational inference with normalizing flows},\n  author={Rezende, Danilo and Mohamed, Shakir},\n  booktitle={ICML},\n  year={2015},\n  organization={PMLR}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: Exploration is a crucial component for discovering approximately optimal policies in most high-dimensional reinforcement learning (RL) settings with sparse rewards. Approaches such as neural density models and continuous exploration (e.g., Go-Explore) have been instrumental in recent advances. Soft actor-critic (SAC) is a method for improving exploration that aims to combine off-policy updates while maximizing the policy entropy. We extend SAC to a richer class of probability distributions through normalizing flows, which we show improves performance in exploration, sample complexity, and convergence. Finally, we show that not only the normalizing flow policy outperforms SAC on MuJoCo domains, it is also significantly lighter, using as low as 5.6% of the original network's parameters for similar performance.\n@inproceedings{mazoure2020leveraging,\n  title={Leveraging exploration in off-policy algorithms via normalizing flows},\n  author={Mazoure, Bogdan and Doan, Thang and Durand, Audrey and Pineau, Joelle and Hjelm, R Devon},\n  booktitle={CoRL},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: Many real-world applications of reinforcement learning require an agent to select optimal actions from continuous spaces. Recently, deep neural networks have successfully been applied to games with discrete actions spaces. However, deep neural networks for discrete actions are not suitable for devising strategies for games where a very small change in an action can dramatically affect the outcome. In this paper, we present a new self-play reinforcement learning framework which equips a continuous search algorithm which enables to search in continuous action spaces with a kernel regression method. Without any hand-crafted features, our network is trained by supervised learning followed by self-play reinforcement learning with a high-ﬁdelity simulator for the Olympic sport of curling. The program trained under our framework outperforms existing programs equipped with several hand-crafted features and won an international digital curling competition.\n@inproceedings{lee2018deep,\n  title={Deep reinforcement learning in continuous action spaces: a case study in the game of simulated curling},\n  author={Lee, Kyowoon and Kim, Sol-A and Choi, Jaesik and Lee, Seong-Whan},\n  booktitle={ICML},\n  year={2018}\n}\n\nAbstract: © ICLR 2019 - Conference Track Proceedings. All rights reserved. Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been successful in a wide variety of simulated domains. However, a major obstacle facing deep RL in the real world is their high sample complexity. Batch policy gradient methods offer stable learning, but at the cost of high variance, which often requires large batches. TD-style methods, such as off-policy actor-critic and Q-learning, are more sample-efficient but biased, and often require costly hyperparameter sweeps to stabilize. In this work, we aim to develop methods that combine the stability of policy gradients with the efficiency of off-policy RL. We present Q-Prop, a policy gradient method that uses a Taylor expansion of the off-policy critic as a control variate. Q-Prop is both sample efficient and stable, and effectively combines the benefits of on-policy and off-policy methods. We analyze the connection between Q-Prop and existing model-free algorithms, and use control variate theory to derive two variants of Q-Prop with conservative and aggressive adaptation. We show that conservative Q-Prop provides substantial gains in sample efficiency over trust region policy optimization (TRPO) with generalized advantage estimation (GAE), and improves stability over deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), the state-of-the-art on-policy and off-policy methods, on OpenAI Gym's MuJoCo continuous control environments.\n@inproceedings{gu2017q,\n  title={Q-Prop: Sample-Efficient Policy Gradient with An Off-Policy Critic},\n  author={Gu, Shixiang and Lillicrap, Timothy and Ghahramani, Zoubin and Turner, Richard E and Levine, Sergey},\n  booktitle={ICLR},\n  year={2017},\n}\n\nAbstract: In this article, we describe a method for optimizing control policies, with guaranteed monotonic improvement. By making several approximations to the theoretically-justified scheme, we develop a practical algorithm, called Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO). This algorithm is effective for optimizing large nonlinear policies such as neural networks. Our experiments demonstrate its robust performance on a wide variety of tasks: learning simulated robotic swimming, hopping, and walking gaits; and playing Atari games using images of the screen as input. Despite its approximations that deviate from the theory, TRPO tends to give monotonic improvement, with little tuning of hyperparameters.\n@inproceedings{schulman2015trust,\n  title={Trust region policy optimization},\n  author={Schulman, John and Levine, Sergey and Abbeel, Pieter and Jordan, Michael and Moritz, Philipp},\n  booktitle={ICML},\n  year={2015}\n}\n\n\n\nAbstract: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) capture dependencies between variables by associating a scalar energy to each configuration of the variab les. Inference consists in clamping the value of observed variables and finding config urations of the remaining variables that minimize the energy. Learning consists in finding an energy function in which observed configurations of the variables a re given lower energies than unobserved ones. The EBM approach provides a common theoretical framework for many learning models, including traditional discr iminative and generative approaches, as well as graph-transformer networks, co nditional random fields, maximum margin Markov networks, and several manifold learning methods. Probabilistic models must be properly normalized, which sometimes requires evaluating intractable integrals over the space of all poss ible variable configurations. Since EBMs have no requirement for proper normalization, this problem is naturally circumvented. EBMs can be viewed as a form of non-probabilistic factor graphs, and they provide considerably more flexibility in th e design of architectures and training criteria than probabilistic approaches .\n@article{lecun2006tutorial,\n  title={A tutorial on energy-based learning},\n  author={LeCun, Yann and Chopra, Sumit and Hadsell, Raia and Ranzato, M and Huang, Fujie},\n  journal={Predicting Structured Data},\n  year={2006}\n}\n\nAbstract: In this paper we propose a new framework for learning from large scale datasets based on iterative learning from small mini-batches. By adding the right amount of noise to a standard stochastic gradient optimization algorithm we show that the iterates will converge to samples from the true posterior distribution as we anneal the stepsize. This seamless transition between optimization and Bayesian posterior sampling provides an inbuilt protection against overfitting. We also propose a practical method for Monte Carlo estimates of posterior statistics which monitors a \"sampling threshold\" and collects samples after it has been surpassed. We apply the method to three models: a mixture of Gaussians, logistic regression and ICA with natural gradients.\n@inproceedings{welling2011bayesian,\n  title={Bayesian learning via stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics},\n  author={Welling, Max and Teh, Yee W},\n  booktitle={ICML},\n  year={2011}\n}\n\nAbstract: We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a \"surrogate\" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.\n@article{schulman2017proximal,\n  title={Proximal policy optimization algorithms},\n  author={Schulman, John and Wolski, Filip and Dhariwal, Prafulla and Radford, Alec and Klimov, Oleg},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1707.06347},\n  year={2017}\n}\n\n@article{o2016combining,\n  title={Combining policy gradient and Q-learning},\n  author={O'Donoghue, Brendan and Munos, Remi and Kavukcuoglu, Koray and Mnih, Volodymyr},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.01626},\n  year={2016}\n}\n\n@article{mnih2015human,\n  title={Human-level control through deep reinforcement learning},\n  author={Mnih, Volodymyr and Kavukcuoglu, Koray and Silver, David and Rusu, Andrei A and Veness, Joel and Bellemare, Marc G and Graves, Alex and Riedmiller, Martin and Fidjeland, Andreas K and Ostrovski, Georg and others},\n  journal={Nature},\n  year={2015}\n}\n\n@book{haarnoja2018acquiring,\n  title={Acquiring diverse robot skills via maximum entropy deep reinforcement learning (Ph.D. thesis)},\n  author={Haarnoja, Tuomas},\n  year={2018},\n  publisher={University of California, Berkeley}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: Hamiltonian dynamics can be used to produce distant proposals for the Metropolis algorithm, thereby avoiding the slow exploration of the state space that results from the diffusive behaviour of simple random-walk proposals. Though originating in physics, Hamiltonian dynamics can be applied to most problems with continuous state spaces by simply introducing fictitious \"momentum\" variables. A key to its usefulness is that Hamiltonian dynamics preserves volume, and its trajectories can thus be used to define complex mappings without the need to account for a hard-to-compute Jacobian factor - a property that can be exactly maintained even when the dynamics is approximated by discretizing time. In this review, I discuss theoretical and practical aspects of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, and present some of its variations, including using windows of states for deciding on acceptance or rejection, computing trajectories using fast approximations, tempering during the course of a trajectory to handle isolated modes, and short-cut methods that prevent useless trajectories from taking much computation time.\n@article{neal2011mcmc,\n  title={MCMC using Hamiltonian dynamics},\n  author={Neal, Radford M and others},\n  journal={Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo},\n  year={2011},\n  publisher={Chapman and Hall/CRC}\n}\n\n@article{hoffman2014no,\n  title={The {N}o-{U}-{T}urn Sampler: Adaptively Setting Path Lengths in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo},\n  author={Hoffman, Matthew D and Gelman, Andrew},\n  journal={JMLR},\n  year={2014}\n}\n\nAbstract: Direct policy search can effectively scale to high-dimensional systems, but complex policies with hundreds of parameters often present a challenge for such methods, requiring numerous samples and often falling into poor local optima.

We evaluate the method by learning neural network controllers for planar swimming, hopping, and walking, as well as simulated 3D humanoid running.\n@inproceedings{levine2013guided,\n  title={Guided policy search},\n  author={Levine, Sergey and Koltun, Vladlen},\n  booktitle={ICML},\n  year={2013}\n}\n\nAbstract: We introduce a new algorithm for reinforcement learning called Maximum aposteriori Policy Optimisation (MPO) based on coordinate ascent on a relative entropy objective.

In this vein, this paper suggests to use the framework of stochastic optimal control with path integrals to derive a novel approach to RL with parameterized policies. While solidly grounded in value function estimation and optimal control based on the stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, policy improvements can be transformed into an approximation problem of a path integral which has no open algorithmic parameters other than the exploration noise. The resulting algorithm can be conceived of as model-based, semi-model-based, or even model free, depending on how the learning problem is structured. The update equations have no danger of numerical instabilities as neither matrix inversions nor gradient learning rates are required. Our new algorithm demonstrates interesting similarities with previous RL research in the framework of probability matching and provides intuition why the slightly heuristically motivated probability matching approach can actually perform well. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant performance improvements over gradient-based policy learning and scalability to high-dimensional control problems. Finally, a learning experiment on a simulated 12 degree-of-freedom robot dog illustrates the functionality of our algorithm in a complex robot learning scenario. We believe that Policy Improvement with Path Integrals (PI2) offers currently one of the most efficient, numerically robust, and easy to implement algorithms for RL based on trajectory roll-outs.\n@article{theodorou2010generalized,\n  title={A generalized path integral control approach to reinforcement learning},\n  author={Theodorou, Evangelos and Buchli, Jonas and Schaal, Stefan},\n  journal={JMLR},\n  year={2010}\n}\n\nAbstract: The general stochastic optimal control (SOC) problem in robotics scenarios is often too complex to be solved exactly and in near real time. A classical approximate solution is to first compute an optimal (deterministic) trajectory and then solve a local linear-quadratic-gaussian (LQG) perturbation model to handle the system stochasticity. We present a new algorithm for this approach which improves upon previous algorithms like iLQG. We consider a probabilistic model for which the maximum likelihood (ML) trajectory coincides with the optimal trajectory and which, in the LQG case, reproduces the classical SOC solution. The algorithm then utilizes approximate inference methods (similar to expectation propagation) that efficiently generalize to non-LQG systems. We demonstrate the algorithm on a simulated 39-DoF humanoid robot.\n@inproceedings{toussaint2009robot,\n  title={Robot trajectory optimization using approximate inference},\n  author={Toussaint, Marc},\n  booktitle={ICML},\n  year={2009}\n}\n\n@article{rawlik2012stochastic,\n  title={On stochastic optimal control and reinforcement learning by approximate inference},\n  author={Rawlik, Konrad and Toussaint, Marc and Vijayakumar, Sethu},\n  journal={Proceedings of Robotics: Science and Systems VIII},\n  year={2012}\n}\n\nAbstract: Reinforcement learning can acquire complex behaviors from high-level specifications. However, defining a cost function that can be optimized effectively and encodes the correct task is challenging in practice. We explore how inverse optimal control (IOC) can be used to learn behaviors from demonstrations, with applications to torque control of high-dimensional robotic systems. Our method addresses two key challenges in inverse optimal control: first, the need for informative features and effective regularization to impose structure on the cost, and second, the difficulty of learning the cost function under unknown dynamics for high-dimensional continuous systems. To address the former challenge, we present an algorithm capable of learning arbitrary nonlinear cost functions, such as neural networks, without meticulous feature engineering. To address the latter challenge, we formulate an efficient sample-based approximation for MaxEnt IOC. We evaluate our method on a series of simulated tasks and real-world robotic manipulation problems, demonstrating substantial improvement over prior methods both in terms of task complexity and sample efficiency.\n@inproceedings{finn2016guided,\n  title={Guided cost learning: Deep inverse optimal control via policy optimization},\n  author={Finn, Chelsea and Levine, Sergey and Abbeel, Pieter},\n  booktitle={ICML},\n  year={2016}\n}\n\n@inproceedings{ziebart2008maximum,\n  title={Maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning.},\n  author={Ziebart, Brian D and Maas, Andrew L and Bagnell, J Andrew and Dey, Anind K and others},\n  booktitle={AAAI},\n  year={2008}\n}\n\nAbstract: Many potential applications of reinforcement learning (RL) require guarantees that the agent will perform well in the face of disturbances to the dynamics or reward function. In this paper, we prove theoretically that standard maximum entropy RL is robust to some disturbances in the dynamics and the reward function. While this capability of MaxEnt RL has been observed empirically in prior work, to the best of our knowledge our work provides the first rigorous proof and theoretical characterization of the MaxEnt RL robust set. While a number of prior robust RL algorithms have been designed to handle similar disturbances to the reward function or dynamics, these methods typically require adding additional moving parts and hyperparameters on top of a base RL algorithm. In contrast, our theoretical results suggest that MaxEnt RL by itself is robust to certain disturbances, without requiring any additional modifications. While this does not imply that MaxEnt RL is the best available robust RL method, MaxEnt RL does possess a striking simplicity and appealing formal guarantees.\n@inproceedings{eysenbach2022maximum,\n  title={Maximum Entropy RL (Provably) Solves Some Robust RL Problems},\n  author={Eysenbach, Benjamin and Levine, Sergey},\n  booktitle={ICLR},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\nAbstract: We introduce a class of MPDs which greatly simplify Reinforcement Learning. They have discrete state spaces and continuous control spaces. The controls have the effect of rescaling the transition probabilities of an underlying Markov chain. A control cost penalizing KL divergence between controlled and uncontrolled transition probabilities makes the minimization problem convex, and allows analytical computation of the optimal controls given the optimal value function. An exponential transformation of the optimal value function makes the minimized Bellman equation linear. Apart from their theoretical significance, the new MDPs enable efficient approximations to traditional MDPs. Shortest path problems are approximated to arbitrary precision with largest eigenvalue problems, yielding an O (n) algorithm. Accurate approximations to generic MDPs are obtained via continuous embedding reminiscent of LP relaxation in integer programming. Off-policy learning of the optimal value function is possible without need for state-action values; the new algorithm (Z-learning) outperforms Q-learning.\n@inproceedings{todorov2006linearly,\n  title={Linearly-solvable Markov decision problems},\n  author={Todorov, Emanuel},\n  booktitle={{NeurIPS}},\n  year={2006}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: Predicting human behavior from a small amount of training examples is a challenging machine learning problem. In this thesis, we introduce the principle of maximum causal entropy, a general technique for applying information theory to decision-theoretic, game-theoretic, and control settings where relevant information is sequentially revealed over time. This approach guarantees decision-theoretic performance by matching purposeful measures of behavior (Abbeel & Ng, 2004), and/or enforces game-theoretic rationality constraints (Aumann, 1974), while otherwise being as uncertain as possible, which minimizes worst-case predictive log-loss (Grunwald & Dawid, 2003). \nWe derive probabilistic models for decision, control, and multi-player game settings using this approach. We then develop corresponding algorithms for efficient inference that include relaxations of the Bellman equation (Bellman, 1957), and simple learning algorithms based on convex optimization. We apply the models and algorithms to a number of behavior prediction tasks. Specifically, we present empirical evaluations of the approach in the domains of vehicle route preference modeling using over 100,000 miles of collected taxi driving data, pedestrian motion modeling from weeks of indoor movement data, and robust prediction of game play in stochastic multi-player games.\n@book{ziebart2010modeling,\n  title={Modeling purposeful adaptive behavior with the principle of maximum causal entropy},\n  author={Ziebart, Brian D},\n  year={2010},\n  publisher={Carnegie Mellon University}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: In this paper we consider deterministic policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement learning with continuous actions. The deterministic policy gradient has a particularly appealing form: it is the expected gradient of the action-value function. This simple form means that the deterministic policy gradient can be estimated much more efficiently than the usual stochastic policy gradient. To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy. We demonstrate that deterministic policy gradient algorithms can significantly outperform their stochastic counterparts in high-dimensional action spaces.\n@inproceedings{silver2014deterministic,\n  title={Deterministic policy gradient algorithms},\n  author={Silver, David and Lever, Guy and Heess, Nicolas and Degris, Thomas and Wierstra, Daan and Riedmiller, Martin},\n  booktitle={ICML},\n  year={2014}}\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: We propose a simple algorithm to train stochastic neural networks to draw samples from given target distributions for probabilistic inference.

As an application of our method, we propose an amortized MLE algorithm for training deep energy model, where a neural sampler is adaptively trained to approximate the likelihood function. Our method mimics an adversarial game between the deep energy model and the neural sampler, and obtains realistic-looking images competitive with the state-of-the-art results.\n@article{wang2016learning,\n  title={Learning to draw samples: With application to amortized mle for generative adversarial learning},\n  author={Wang, Dilin and Liu, Qiang},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1611.01722},\n  year={2016}\n}\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: Recently, researchers have made significant progress combining the advances in deep learning for learning feature representations with reinforcement learning.

In this work, we present a benchmark suite of continuous control tasks, including classic tasks like cart-pole swing-up, tasks with very high state and action dimensionality such as 3D humanoid locomotion, tasks with partial observations, and tasks with hierarchical structure.

Most algorithms, based on temporal differences, replace the true value of a transiting state by their current estimate of this value. Yet, another estimate could be leveraged to bootstrap RL: the current policy. Our core contribution stands in a very simple idea: adding the scaled log-policy to the immediate reward. We show that slightly modifying Deep Q-Network (DQN) in that way provides an agent that is competitive with distributional methods on Atari games, without making use of distributional RL, n-step returns or prioritized replay. To demonstrate the versatility of this idea, we also use it together with an Implicit Quantile Network (IQN). The resulting agent outperforms Rainbow on Atari, installing a new State of the Art with very little modifications to the original algorithm. To add to this empirical study, we provide strong theoretical insights on what happens under the hood -- implicit Kullback-Leibler regularization and increase of the action-gap.\n@inproceedings{vieillard2020munchausen,\n  title={Munchausen reinforcement learning},\n  author={Vieillard, Nino and Pietquin, Olivier and Geist, Matthieu},\n  booktitle={NeurIPS},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\nAbstract: Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a deterministic sampling algorithm that iteratively transports a set of particles to approximate given distributions, based on an efficient gradient-based update that guarantees to optimally decrease the KL divergence within a function space.

In this paper we explore an alternative approach in which the policy is explicitly represented by its own function approximator, independent of the value function, and is updated according to the gradient of expected reward with respect to the policy parameters. Williams's REINFORCE method and actor-critic methods are examples of this approach. Our main new result is to show that the gradient can be written in a form suitable for estimation from experience aided by an approximate action-value or advantage function. Using this result, we prove for the first time that a version of policy iteration with arbitrary differentiable function approximation is convergent to a locally optimal policy.\n@article{sutton1999policy,\n  title={Policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning with function approximation},\n  author={Sutton, Richard S and McAllester, David and Singh, Satinder and Mansour, Yishay},\n  journal={NeurIPS},\n  year={1999}\n}\n\nAbstract: We propose a general purpose variational inference algorithm that forms a natural counterpart of gradient descent for optimization.

However, when the goal space has discontinuities and the reward is sparse, a majority of goals are difficult to reach. In this context, a curriculum over goals helps agents learn by adapting training tasks to their current capabilities. In this work we propose Stein Variational Goal Generation (SVGG), which samples goals of intermediate difficulty for the agent, by leveraging a learned predictive model of its goal reaching capabilities. The distribution of goals is modeled with particles that are attracted in areas of appropriate difficulty using Stein Variational Gradient Descent. We show that SVGG outperforms state-of-the-art multi-goal Reinforcement Learning methods in terms of success coverage in hard exploration problems, and demonstrate that it is endowed with a useful recovery property when the environment changes.\n@article{castanet2023stein,\n  title={Stein Variational Goal Generation for adaptive Exploration in Multi-Goal Reinforcement Learning},\n  author={Castanet, Nicolas and Sigaud, Olivier and others},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\nAbstract: We introduce a curriculum learning algorithm, Variational Automatic Curriculum Learning (VACL), for solving challenging goal-conditioned cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning problems. We motivate our paradigm through a variational perspective, where the learning objective can be decomposed into two terms: task learning on the current task distribution, and curriculum update to a new task distribution. Local optimization over the second term suggests that the curriculum should gradually expand the training tasks from easy to hard. Our VACL algorithm implements this variational paradigm with two practical components, task expansion and entity progression, which produces training curricula over both the task configurations as well as the number of entities in the task. Experiment results show that VACL solves a collection of sparse-reward problems with a large number of agents. Particularly, using a single desktop machine, VACL achieves 98% coverage rate with 100 agents in the simple-spread benchmark and reproduces the ramp-use behavior originally shown in OpenAI's hide-and-seek project.

However, existing SG-MCMC schemes are not tailored to any specific probabilistic model, even a simple modification of the underlying dynamical system requires significant physical intuition. This paper presents the first meta-learning algorithm that allows automated design for the underlying continuous dynamics of an SG-MCMC sampler. The learned sampler generalizes Hamiltonian dynamics with state-dependent drift and diffusion, enabling fast traversal and efficient exploration of neural network energy landscapes. Experiments validate the proposed approach on both Bayesian fully connected neural network and Bayesian recurrent neural network tasks, showing that the learned sampler out-performs generic, hand-designed SG-MCMC algorithms, and generalizes to different datasets and larger architectures.\n@article{gong2018meta,\n  title={Meta-learning for stochastic gradient MCMC},\n  author={Gong, Wenbo and Li, Yingzhen and Hern{\\'a}ndez-Lobato, Jos{\\'e} Miguel},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1806.04522},\n  year={2018}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbstract: Policy gradient methods have been successfully applied to many complex reinforcement learning problems. However, policy gradient methods suffer from high variance, slow convergence, and inefficient exploration. In this work, we introduce a maximum entropy policy optimization framework which explicitly encourages parameter exploration, and show that this framework can be reduced to a Bayesian inference problem. We then propose a novel Stein variational policy gradient method (SVPG) which combines existing policy gradient methods and a repulsive functional to generate a set of diverse but well-behaved policies. SVPG is robust to initialization and can easily be implemented in a parallel manner. On continuous control problems, we find that implementing SVPG on top of REINFORCE and advantage actor-critic algorithms improves both average return and data efficiency.\n@article{liu2017steinn,\n  title={Stein variational policy gradient},\n  author={Liu, Yang and Ramachandran, Prajit and Liu, Qiang and Peng, Jian},\n  journal={UAI},\n  year={2017}\n}\n\n\n@article{kumar2018engan,\n  title={EnGAN: Latent Space MCMC and Maximum Entropy Generators for Energy-based Models},\n  author={Kumar, Rithesh and Goyal, Anirudh and Courville, Aaron and Bengio, Yoshua},\n  journal={ICLR},\n  year={2019}\n}\n\n@article{van2018simple,\n  title={A simple introduction to Markov Chain Monte--Carlo sampling},\n  author={Van Ravenzwaaij, Don and Cassey, Pete and Brown, Scott D},\n  journal={Psychon.

The FRAME (Filters, Random fields, And Maximum Entropy) model is such a generative model for texture patterns. It is a Markov random field model (or a Gibbs distribution, or an energy-based model) of stationary spatial processes. The log probability density function of the model (or the energy function of the Gibbs distribution) is the sum of translation-invariant potential functions that are one-dimensional non-linear transformations of linear filter responses. In this paper, we review two generalizations of this model. One is a sparse FRAME model for non-stationary patterns such as objects, where the potential functions are location specific, and they are non-zero only at a selected collection of locations. The other generalization is a deep FRAME model where the filters are defined by a convolutional neural network (CNN or ConvNet). This leads to a deep convolutional energy-based model. The local modes of the energy function satisfies an auto-encoder which we call the Hopfield auto-encoder. The model can be learned by an “analysis by synthesis” algorithm that iterates a sampling step for synthesis and a learning step for analysis. The algorithm admits an adversarial interpretation where the learning step and sampling step play a minimax game based on a value function. We can recruit a generator model as a direct and approximate sampler of the deep energy-based model to speed up the sampling step, and the two models can be learned simultaneously by a cooperative learning algorithm.\n@article{wu2018sparse,\n  title={Sparse and deep generalizations of the frame model},\n  author={Wu, Ying Nian and Xie, Jianwen and Lu, Yang and Zhu, Song-Chun},\n  journal={Annals of Mathematical Sciences and Applications},\n  year={2018},\n  publisher={International Press of Boston}\n}\n\nAbstract: We present an efficient algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) of exponential family models, with a general parametrization of the energy function that includes neural networks. We exploit the primal-dual view of the MLE with a kinetics augmented model to obtain an estimate associated with an adversarial dual sampler. To represent this sampler, we introduce a novel neural architecture, dynamics embedding, that generalizes Hamiltonian Monte-Carlo (HMC). The proposed approach inherits the flexibility of HMC while enabling tractable entropy estimation for the augmented model. By learning both a dual sampler and the primal model simultaneously, and sharing parameters between them, we obviate the requirement to design a separate sampling procedure once the model has been trained, leading to more effective learning. We show that many existing estimators, such as contrastive divergence, pseudo/composite-likelihood, score matching, minimum Stein discrepancy estimator, non-local contrastive objectives, noise-contrastive estimation, and minimum probability flow, are special cases of the proposed approach, each expressed by a different (fixed) dual sampler. An empirical investigation shows that adapting the sampler during MLE can significantly improve on state-of-the-art estimators.\n@article{dai2019exponential,\n  title={Exponential family estimation via adversarial dynamics embedding},\n  author={Dai, Bo and Liu, Zhen and Dai, Hanjun and He, Niao and Gretton, Arthur and Song, Le and Schuurmans, Dale},\n  journal={NeurIPS},\n  year={2019}\n}\n\nAbstract: We introduce a new framework that performs decision-making in reinforcement learning (RL) as an iterative reasoning process. We model agent behavior as the steady-state distribution of a parameterized reasoning Markov chain (RMC), optimized with a new tractable estimate of the policy gradient. We perform action selection by simulating the RMC for enough reasoning steps to approach its steady-state distribution. We show our framework has several useful properties that are inherently missing from traditional RL. For instance, it allows agent behavior to approximate any continuous distribution over actions by parameterizing the RMC with a simple Gaussian transition function. Moreover, the number of reasoning steps to reach convergence can scale adaptively with the difficulty of each action selection decision and can be accelerated by re-using past solutions. Our resulting algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance in popular Mujoco and DeepMind Control benchmarks, both for proprioceptive and pixel-based tasks.\n@article{cetin2022policy,\n  title={Policy Gradient With Serial Markov Chain Reasoning},\n  author={Cetin, Edoardo and Celiktutan, Oya},\n  journal={NeurIPS},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\nAbstract: Policy networks are a central feature of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for continuous control, enabling the estimation and sampling of high-value actions. From the variational inference perspective on RL, policy networks, when employed with entropy or KL regularization, are a form of amortized optimization, optimizing network parameters rather than the policy distributions directly. However, this direct amortized mapping can empirically yield suboptimal policy estimates. Given this perspective, we consider the more flexible class of iterative amortized optimizers. We demonstrate that the resulting technique, iterative amortized policy optimization, yields performance improvements over conventional direct amortization methods on benchmark continuous control tasks.\n@article{marino2021iterative,\n  title={Iterative amortized policy optimization},\n  author={Marino, Joseph and Pich{\\'e}, Alexandre and Ialongo, Alessandro Davide and Yue, Yisong},\n  journal={NeurIPS},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\n\n@book{devore2012modern,\n  title={Modern mathematical statistics with applications},\n  author={Devore, Jay L and Berk, Kenneth N and Carlton, Matthew A and others},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={Springer}\n}\n\nAbstract: In this paper, we propose to equip Generative Adversarial Networks with the ability to produce direct energy estimates for samples.

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.\n@inproceedings{haarnoja2018soft,\n  title={Soft actor-critic: Off-policy maximum entropy deep reinforcement learning with a stochastic actor},\n  author={Haarnoja, Tuomas and Zhou, Aurick and Abbeel, Pieter and Levine, Sergey},\n  booktitle={ICML},\n  year={2018}\n}\n\n\nThe above content represents the relevant literature in this field.

Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) has been proposed to model the policy as an expressive Energy-Based Model (EBM) over Q-values. However, estimating the entropy of such EBMs remains an open problem. Existing approaches either implicitly estimate the entropy, resulting in high computational complexity and variance, or follow a variational inference procedure that fits simplified actor distributions, such as Gaussians, for tractability. These methods either compromise efficiency or fail to capture the complexity of the action space, leading to suboptimal solutions. The paper aims to develop a more efficient and expressive method for MaxEnt RL that overcomes these limitations.\n\n## Main Idea\n\nThe paper introduces Stein Soft Actor-Critic (S2AC), a MaxEnt RL algorithm that leverages parameterized Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) as the underlying policy.

Notably, in Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL), the policy is modeled as an expressive Energy-Based Model (EBM) over the Q-values. However, this formulation requires the estimation of the entropy of such EBMs, which is an open problem. To address this, previous MaxEnt RL methods either implicitly estimate the entropy, resulting in high computational complexity and variance (SQL), or follow a variational inference procedure that fits simplified actor distributions (\\eg Gaussian) for tractability (SAC). We propose \\underline{S}tein \\underline{S}oft \\underline{A}ctor-\\underline{C}ritic (\\STAC), a MaxEnt RL algorithm that learns expressive policies without compromising efficiency. Specifically, \\STAC\\ uses parameterized Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) as the underlying policy. We derive a closed-form expression of the entropy of such policies. Our formula is computationally efficient and only depends on first-order derivatives and vector products. Empirical results show that \\STAC\\ yields more optimal solutions to the MaxEnt objective than SQL and SAC in the multi-goal environment, and outperforms SAC and SQL on the MuJoCo benchmark\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\label{sec:introduction}\n\n\\input{figures/teaser2}\nMaxEnt RL \\citep{todorov2006linearly,ziebart2010modeling,haarnoja2017reinforcement,kappen2005path,toussaint2009robot,theodorou2010generalized,abdolmaleki2018maximum,haarnoja2018soft,vieillard2020munchausen} has been proposed to address challenges hampering the deployment of RL to real-world applications, including stability, sample efficiency ~\\citep{gu2017q}, and robustness \\citep{eysenbach2022maximum}. Instead of learning a deterministic policy, as in classical RL \\citep{sutton1999policy,schulman2017proximal,silver2014deterministic, lillicrap2015continuous}, MaxEnt RL learns a stochastic policy that captures the intricacies of the action space. This enables better exploration during training and eventually better robustness to environmental perturbations at test time, \\ie the agent learns multimodal action space distributions which enables picking the next best action in case a perturbation prevents the execution of the optimal one. To achieve this, MaxEnt RL models the policy using the expressive family of EBMs \\citep{lecun2006tutorial}. This translates into learning policies that maximize the sum of expected future reward and expected future entropy. However, estimating the entropy of such complex distributions remains an open problem. \n\nTo address this, existing approaches either use tricks to go around the entropy computation or make limiting assumptions on the policy. This results in either poor scalability or convergence to suboptimal solutions. For example, SQL \\citep{haarnoja2017reinforcement} implicitly incorporates entropy in the Q-function computation. This requires using importance sampling, which results in high variability and hence poor training stability and limited scalability to high dimensional action spaces. SAC \\citep{haarnoja2018soft}, on the other hand, follows a variational inference procedure by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the EBM policy. This enables a closed-form evaluation of the entropy but results in a suboptimal solution. For instance, SAC fails in environments characterized by multimodal action distributions. Similar to SAC, IAPO \\citep{marino2021iterative} models the policy as a uni-modal Gaussian. Instead of optimizing a MaxEnt objective, it achieves multimodal policies by learning a collection of parameter estimates (mean, variance) through different initializations for different policies. To improve the expressiveness of SAC, SSPG \\citep{cetin2022policy} and SAC-NF \\citep{mazoure2020leveraging} model the policy as a Markov chain with Gaussian transition probabilities and as a normalizing flow \\citep{rezende2015variational}, respectively. However, due to training stability issues, the reported results in \\cite{cetin2022policy} show that though both models learn multi-modal policies, they fail to maximize the expected future entropy in positive rewards setups.\n\n\n\\input{figures/teaser}\n\nWe conduct extensive empirical evaluations of \\STAC\\ from three aspects. We start with a sanity check on the merit of our derived SVGD-based entropy estimate on target distributions with known entropy values (\\eg Gaussian) or log-likelihoods (\\eg Gaussian Mixture Models) and assess its sensitivity to different SVGD parameters (kernel, initial distribution, number of steps and number of particles). We observe that its performance depends on the choice of the kernel and is robust to variations of the remaining parameters. In particular, we find out that the kernel should be chosen to guarantee inter-dependencies between the particles, which turns out to be essential for invertibility. Next, we assess the performance of \\STAC\\ on a multi-goal environment \\citep{haarnoja2017reinforcement} where different goals are associated with the same positive (maximum) expected future reward but different (maximum) expected future entropy. We show that \\STAC\\ learns multimodal policies and effectively maximizes the entropy, leading to better robustness to obstacles placed at test time. Finally, we test \\STAC\\ on the MuJoCo benchmark \\citep{duan2016benchmarking}. \\STAC\\ yields better performances than the baselines on four out of the five environments. Moreover, \\STAC\\ shows higher sample efficiency as it tends to converge with fewer training steps. These results were obtained from running SVGD for only three steps, which results in a small overhead compared to SAC during training. Furthermore, to maximize the run-time efficiency during testing, we train an amortized SVGD version of the policy to mimic the SVGD-based policy. Hence, this reduces inference to a forward pass through the policy network without compromising the performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Preliminaries}\n\n\\subsection{Samplers for Energy-based Models}\\label{sec:ebm_samplers}\nIn this work, we study three representative methods for sampling from EBMs: (1) Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) \\& Deterministic Langevin Dynamics (DLD)~\\citep{welling2011bayesian}, (2) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)~\\citep{neal2011mcmc}, and (3) Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD)~\\citep{liu2016stein}. \nSVGD is a particle-based Bayesian inference algorithm. Compared to SGLD and HMC which have a single particle in their dynamics, SVGD operates on a set of particles. Specifically, SVGD samples a set of $m$  particles $\\{a_j\\}_{j=1}^m$ from an initial distribution $q^{0}$ which it then transforms through a sequence of updates to fit the target distribution. Formally, at every iteration $l$, SVGD applies a form of functional gradient descent $\\Delta f$ that minimizes the KL-divergence between the target distribution $p$ and the proposal distribution $q^{l}$ induced by the particles, \\ie the update rule for the $i^{\\text{th}}$ particles is: $a^{l+1}_{i} = a^{l}_{i} + \\epsilon \\Delta f(a_{i}^{l})$ with \n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:svgd_update}\n\\Delta f(a_{i}^{l}) = \\mathbb{E}_{a_{j}^l\\sim q^l}\\big[ k(a^{l}_{i},a^{l}_{j})\\nabla_{a^{l}_j}\\log p(a^{l}_{j}) + \\nabla_{a^{l}_{j}}k(a^{l}_i,a^{l}_j)\\big] .\n\\end{equation} \nHere, $\\epsilon$ is the step size and $k(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is the kernel function, \\eg the RBF kernel: \n$k(a_i,a_j) = \\exp(||a_i -a_j||^2/2 \\sigma^2)$. \nThe first term within the gradient drives the particles toward the high probability regions of $p$, while the second term serves as a repulsive force to encourage dispersion. \n\\subsection{Maximum-Entropy RL}\nWe consider an infinite horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) defined by a tuple $(\\cS,\\cA,p,r)$, where $\\cS$ is the state space, $\\cA$ is the action space and $p: \\cS \\times \\cA \\times \\cS \\rightarrow [0,\\infty]$ is the state transition probability modeling the density of the next state $s_{t+1} \\in \\cS$ given the current state $s_t \\in \\mathcal{S}$ and action $a_t \\in \\mathcal{A}$. Additionally, we assume that the environment emits a bounded reward function $r \\in [r_{\\text{min}}, r_{\\text{max}}]$ at every iteration. We use $\\rho_{\\pi}(s_t)$ and $\\rho_{\\pi}(s_t, a_t)$ to denote the state and state-action marginals of the trajectory distribution induced by a policy $\\pi (a_t | s_t)$. We consider the setup of continuous action spaces \\cite{lazaric2007reinforcement,lee2018deep,zhou2023single}. MaxEnt RL~\\citep{todorov2006linearly,ziebart2010modeling,rawlik2012stochastic} learns a policy $\\pi^{*}(a_t|s_t)$,  that instead of maximizing the expected future reward, maximizes the sum of the expected future reward and entropy:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:max_entr_obj}\n\\pi^{*}= \\argmax\\nolimits_{\\pi}  \\sum\\nolimits_t \\gamma^t \\mathbb{E}_{(s_t,a_t)\\sim \\rho_{\\pi}} \\big[ r(s_t,a_t) + \\alpha \\mathcal{H}(\\pi(\\cdot|s_t))\\big],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\alpha$ is a temperature parameter controlling the stochasticity of the policy and $\\mathcal{H}(\\pi(\\cdot|s_t))$ is the entropy of the policy at state $s_t$. The conventional RL objective can be recovered for $\\alpha=0$\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:ebm}\n\\pi^{*} = \\argmin\\nolimits_{\\pi} \\sum\\nolimits_t \\mathbb{E}_{s_t \\sim \\rho_\\pi}\\big[ D_{K\\!L}\\big(\\pi(\\cdot|s_t) \\| \\exp\\!{(  Q(s_t,\\cdot)/\\alpha )}/Z \\big)\\big],\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $D_{KL}$ is the KL-divergence and $Z$ is the normalizing constant. We now review two landmark MaxEnt RL algorithms: SAC \\citep{haarnoja2018soft} and SQL \\citep{haarnoja2017reinforcement}.\n\n\\textbf{SAC} is an actor-critic algorithm that alternates between policy evaluation, \\ie evaluating the Q-values for a policy $\\pi_{\\theta}(a_t|s_t)$:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:sac_pe}\nQ_{\\phi}(s_t,a_t) \\leftarrow r(s_t,a_t)+ \\gamma\\mathop{\\mathbb{E}}\\nolimits_{s_{t+1},a_{t+1}\\sim \\rho_{\\pi_{\\theta}}}\\big[ Q_{\\phi}(s_{t+1},a_{t+1}) + \\alpha  \\cH(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s_{t+1}))  \\big]\n\\end{equation} %\\rho(s',a')\nand policy improvement, \\ie using the updated Q-values to compute a better policy:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:sac_pi}\n\\pi_{\\theta}= \\argmax\\nolimits_{\\theta} \\sum\\nolimits_t \\mathop{\\mathbb{E}_{s_t,a_t \\sim \\rho_{\\pi_{\\theta}} } } \\big[ Q_{\\phi}(a_t,s_t) + \\alpha \\cH(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s_t) )  \\big].\n\\end{equation}\nSAC models $\\pi_{\\theta}$ as an isotropic Gaussian, \\ie $\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot |s ) = \\cN(\\mu_{\\theta}, \\sigma_{\\theta}I)$.  While this enables computing a closed-form expression of the entropy, it incurs an over-simplification of the true action distribution, and thus cannot represent complex distributions, \\eg multimodal distributions.\n\n\\textbf{SQL} goes around the entropy computation, by defining a soft version of the value function $V_{\\phi}=\\alpha \\log \\big(  \\int_{\\cA} \\exp\\big( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} Q_{\\phi}(s_t,a')  \\big) da' \\big)$. This enables expressing the Q-value (Eq~\\eqref{eq:sac_pe}) independently from the entropy, \\ie $Q_{\\phi}(s_t,a_t)=r(s_t,a_t)+\\gamma \\E_{s_{t+1}\\sim p}[V_{\\phi}(s_{t+1})]$. Hence, SQL follows a soft value iteration which alternates between the updates of the ``soft'' versions of $Q$ and value functions:\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\label{eq:sql_q}&Q_{\\phi}(s_t,a_t) \\leftarrow r(s_t,a_t)+\\gamma \\E_{s_{t+1}\\sim p}[V_{\\phi}(s_{t+1})], \\ \\forall (s_t, a_t)  \\\\\n\\label{eq:sql_v}&V_{\\phi}(s_t) \\leftarrow  \\alpha \\log \\big(  \\int_{\\cA} \\exp\\big( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} Q_{\\phi}(s_t,a')  \\big) da' \\big), \\ \\forall s_t.\n\\end{eqnarray} \nOnce the $Q_{\\phi}$ and $V_{\\phi}$ functions converge, SQL uses amortized SVGD~\\cite{wang2016learning} to learn a stochastic sampling network $f_{\\theta}( \\xi, s_t )$ that maps noise samples $\\xi$ into the action samples from the EBM policy distribution $\\pi^{*}(a_t|s_t)= \\exp \\big( \\frac{1}{\\alpha} ( Q^{*}(s_t,a_t) - V^{*}(s_t))\\big)$. The parameters $\\theta$ are obtained by minimizing the loss $ J_{\\theta}(s_t) = D_{K\\!L} \\big( \\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s_t)|| \\exp\\!{ \\big(\\frac{1}{\\alpha} (Q^{*}_{\\phi}(s_t,\\cdot)-V^{*}_{\\phi}(s_t)}) \\big)$ with respect to $\\theta$. Here, $\\pi_{\\theta}$ denotes the policy induced by $f_{\\theta}$. SVGD is designed to minimize such KL-divergence without explicitly computing $\\pi_{\\theta}$. In particular, SVGD provides the most greedy direction as a functional $\\Delta f_{\\theta}(\\cdot,s_t)$ (Eq~\\eqref{eq:svgd_update}) which can be used to approximate the gradient $\\partial J_{\\theta}/\\partial a_t$. Hence, the gradient of the loss $J_\\theta$ with respect to $\\theta$ is: $\\partial J_{\\theta}(s_t)/\\partial \\theta \\propto \\E_{\\xi} \\big[ \\Delta f_{\\theta}(\\xi, s_t)  \\partial f_{\\theta}(\\xi, s_t)/\\partial \\theta \\big]$. Note that the integral in Eq~\\eqref{eq:sql_v} is approximated via importance sampling, which is known to result in high variance estimates and hence poor scalability to high dimensional action spaces. Moreover, amortized generation is usually unstable and prone to mode collapse, an issue similar to GANs. Therefore, SQL is outperformed by SAC~\\cite{haarnoja2018soft} on benchmark tasks like MuJoCo.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Approach}\n\nWe introduce \\STAC, a new actor-critic MaxEnt RL algorithm that uses SVGD as the underlying actor to generate action samples from policies represented using EBMs. This choice is motivated by the expressivity of distributions that can be fitted via SVGD. Additionally, we show that we can derive a closed-form entropy estimate of the SVGD-induced distribution, thanks to the invertibility of the update rule, which does not necessarily hold for other EBM samplers. Besides, we propose a parameterized version of SVGD to enable scalability to high-dimensional action spaces and non-smooth Q-function landscapes. \\STAC\\ is hence capable of learning a more optimal solution to the MaxEnt RL objective (Eq~\\eqref{eq:max_entr_obj}) as illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:multi-goal-teaser}.\n\\subsection{Stein Soft Actor Critic}\nLike SAC, \\STAC\\ performs soft policy iteration which alternates between policy evaluation and policy improvement. The difference is that we model the actor as a \\textit{parameterized sampler from an EBM}. Hence, the policy distribution corresponds to an expressive EBM as opposed to a Gaussian. \n\n\\textbf{Critic.} The critic's parameters $\\phi$ are obtained by minimizing the Bellman loss as traditionally:\n\\begin{equation}\n\\phi^{*} = \\argmin\\nolimits_{\\phi}\\E_{(s_t,a_t) \\sim \\rho_{\\pi_{\\theta}}} \\left[ (Q_{\\phi}(s_t,a_t) - \\hat{y})^2  \\right],\n\\label{eq:critic_update}\n\\end{equation} \nwith the target $\\hat{y}\n= r_{t}(s_t,a_t) + \\gamma \\E_{(s_{t+1},a_{t+1}) \\sim \\rho_{\\pi}} \\left[Q_{\\bar{\\phi}}(s_{t+1},a_{t+1}) + \\alpha\\mathcal{H}(  \\pi(\\cdot|s_{t+1}))\\right].$\nHere $\\bar{\\phi}$ is an exponentially moving average of the value\nnetwork weights \\citep{mnih2015human}. \n\n\\textbf{Actor as an EBM sampler.} The actor is modeled as a sampler from an EBM over the Q-values. To generate a set of valid actions, the actor first samples a set of particles $\\{a^{0}\\}$ from an initial distribution $q^{0}$ (\\eg Gaussian). These particles are then updated over several iterations $l \\in [1,L]$, \\ie $\\{a^{l+1}\\} \\leftarrow \\{a^{l}\\} + \\epsilon h(\\{a^{l}\\},s)$ following the sampler dynamics characterized by a transformation $h$ (\\eg for SVGD, $h=\\Delta f$ in Eq~\\eqref{eq:svgd_update}). If $q^{0}$ is tractable and $h$ is invertible, it's possible to compute a closed-form expression of the distribution of the particles at the $l^{\\text{th}}$ iteration via the change of variable formula \\cite{devore2012modern}: $q^{l}( a^{l}|s ) = q^{l-1}( a^{l-1}|s )\\left|\\det (I + \\epsilon \\nabla_{a^l} h(a^{l},s)) \\right|^{-1}, \\forall l \\in[1,L]$. In this case, the policy is represented using the particle distribution at the final step $L$ of the sampler dynamics, \\ie $\\pi(a|s)= q^{L}(a^L|s)$ and the entropy can be estimated by averaging $\\log q^{L}(a^L|s)$ over a set of particles (Section \\ref{sec:entropy}). We study the invertibility of popular EBM samplers in Section \\ref{sec:invertible_policies}. \n\\input{figures/fig_actor} \n\\textbf{Parameterized initialization.} To reduce the number of steps required to converge to the target distribution (hence reducing computation cost), we further propose modeling the initial distribution as a parameterized isotropic Gaussian, \\ie $a^0\\sim\\cN(\\mu_{\\theta}(s),\\sigma_{\\theta}(s))$. The parameterization trick is then used to express $a^{0}$ as a function of $\\theta$. Intuitively, the actor would learn $\\theta$ such that the initial distribution is close to the target distribution. Hence, fewer steps are required to converge, as illustrated in \\Figref{fig:actor}. Note that if the number of steps $L=0$, \\STAC\\ is reduced to SAC. Besides, to deal with the non-smooth nature of deep Q-function landscapes which might lead to particle divergence in the sampling process, we bound the particle updates to be within a few standard deviations ($t$) from the mean of the learned initial distribution, \\ie $-t\\sigma_{\\theta} \\leq a_{\\theta}^{l} \\leq t\\sigma_{\\theta}$, $\\forall l \\in [1,L]$. Eventually, the initial distribution $q_{\\theta}^{0}$ learns to contour the high-density region of the target distribution and the following updates refine it by converging to the spanned modes. Formally, the parameters $\\theta$ are computed by minimizing the expected KL-divergence between the policy $q_{\\theta}^L$ induced by the particles from the sampler and the EBM of the Q-values:\n\\begin{align} \n\\theta^{*} \\!=\\! &\\argmax\\nolimits_{\\theta}\\!  \\E_{s_t \\sim \\cD,  a_{\\theta}^L \\sim \\pi_{\\theta}} \\left[ Q_{\\phi}(s_t, a_{\\theta}^L) \\right] + \\alpha  \\E_{s_t \\sim \\cD} \\left[  \\mathcal{H}( \\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s_t) ) \\right] \\nonumber\\\\\n\\text{s.t. } &-t\\sigma_{\\theta} \\leq a_{\\theta}^{l} \\leq t\\sigma_{\\theta}, \\quad \\forall l \\in [1,L] .\n\\label{eq:actor_loss}\n\\end{align}\nHere, $\\cD$ is the replay buffer. Note that the constraint does not truncate the particles as it is not an invertible transformation which then violates the assumptions of the change of variable formula. Instead, we sample more particles than we need and select the ones that stay within the range. We call \\STAC($\\phi,\\theta$) and \\STAC($\\phi$) as two versions of  \\STAC\\ with/without the parameterized initial distribution. \n\n\n\\subsection{A Closed-Form Expression of the Policy's Entropy}\n\\label{sec:entropy}\nA critical challenge in MaxEnt RL is how to efficiently compute the entropy term $\\mathcal{H}(\\pi(\\cdot|s_{t+1}))$\nin Eq~\\eqref{eq:max_entr_obj}. We show that, if we model the policy as an iterative sampler from the EBM, under certain conditions, we can derive a closed-form estimate of the entropy at convergence. \n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:generic_entropy}\nLet $F:\\mathbb{R}^{n} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n}$ be an invertible transformation of the form $F(a) = a + \\epsilon h(a) $. We denote by $q^L(a^L)$ the distribution obtained from repeatedly applying $F$ to a set of samples $\\{a^{0}\\}$ from an initial distribution $q^{0}(a^0)$ over $L$ steps, \\ie $a^{L} = F \\circ F \\circ \\cdots \\circ F(a^{0})$. Under the condition $ \\epsilon ||\\nabla_{a^{l}_{i} } h(a_i)||_{\\infty} \\ll 1 $, $\\forall l \\in [1,L]$,\nthe distribution of the particles at the $L^{\\text{th}}$ step is:\n\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:generic_entropy}\n\\log q^{L}(a^L) \\approx \\log q^0(a^0) - \\epsilon \\sum\\nolimits_{l = 0}^{L-1}  \\, \\Tr(\\nabla_{a^{l}} h(a^{l})) + \\cO(\\epsilon^2 dL).\n\\end{equation}\nHere, $d$ is the dimensionality of $a$, \\ie $a\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\\cO(\\epsilon^2 dL)$ is the order of approximation error.\n\\end{theorem}\n\\proofsketch{\n\n~\\eqref{eq:generic_entropy}.} Note that the condition $ \\epsilon ||\\nabla_{a_i} h(a_i)||_{\\infty} \\ll 1 $ can always be satisfied when we choose a sufficiently small step size $\\epsilon$, \\textit{or} the gradient of $h(a)$ is small, \\ie $h(a)$ is Lipschitz continuous with a sufficiently small constant. \\\\\nIt follows from the theorem above, that the entropy of a policy modeled as an EBM sampler (Eq~\\eqref{eq:actor_loss}) can be expressed analytically as:\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:closed_form_entropy}\n\\mathcal{H}(\\pi_{\\theta}(\\cdot|s))\\!=\\! -\\mathbb{E}_{a_{\\theta}^{0}\\sim q_{\\theta}^{0}}\\Big[\\log q_{\\theta}^{L}(a_{\\theta}^{L} |s)\\Big]\\!\\approx\\!-\\mathbb{E}_{a_{\\theta}^{0}\\sim q_{\\theta}^{0} }\\Big[\\!\\log q_{\\theta}^{0}(a^{0}|s)\\!-\\!\\epsilon\\!\\sum\\nolimits_{l = 0}^{L-1} \\Tr\\!\\Big(\\!\\nabla_{a_{\\theta}^{l}}\\!h(a_{\\theta}^{l},s)\\!\\Big)\\!\\Big].\n\\end{equation}\nIn the following, we drop the dependency of the action on $\\theta$ for simplicity of the notation.\n\\subsection{Invertible Policies}\n\\label{sec:invertible_policies}\nNext, we study the invertibility of three popular EBM samplers: SVGD, SGLD, and HMC as well as the efficiency of computing the trace, \\ie $\\Tr(\\nabla_{a^l} h(a^{l}, s))$ in Eq~\\eqref{eq:generic_entropy} for the ones that are invertible.\n\\begin{proposition}[SVGD invertibility]\\label{prop:svgd_invertibility}\n Given the SVGD learning rate $\\epsilon$ and RBF kernel $k(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ with variance $\\sigma$, if $\\epsilon \\ll \\sigma $, the update rule of SVGD dynamics defined in Eq~\\eqref{eq:svgd_update} is invertible.\n\\end{proposition}\n\\proofsketch{We use the explicit function theorem to show that the Jacobian $\\nabla_{a} F(a,s)$ of the update rule $F(a,s)$ is diagonally dominated and hence invertible. This yields invertibility of $F(a,s)$.}\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:svgd_entropy} \nThe closed-form estimate of $\\log q^L(a^L|s)$ for the SVGD based sampler with an RBF kernel $k(\\cdot,\\cdot)$ is \n\\begin{equation*}\\small\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\log q^L(a^L|s)\\!\\approx\\!\\log\\!q^{0}(a^{0}|s)\\!+\\!\\frac{\\epsilon}{m \\sigma^2}\\!\\sum_{l=0}^{L-1}\\sum_{j=1, a^{l} \\neq a_{j}^{l}}^{m}\\!k(a^{l}_{j},a^l)\\Big(\\!(a^{l}\\!-\\!a^{l}_{j})^{\\top} \\nabla_{a^{l}_{j}} Q(s,a^{l}_{j})\\!+\\!\\frac{\\alpha}{\\sigma^2}\\|a^{l}\\!-\\!a^{l}_{j}\\|^{2}\\!-\\!d \\alpha \\Big).\n\\end{aligned}\\label{eq:svgd_entr_formula}\n\\end{equation*}\n\\end{theorem}\nHere, $(\\cdot)^\\top$ denotes the transpose of a matrix/vector.\nNote that the entropy does not depend on any matrix computation, but only on vector dot products and first-order vector derivatives. Intuitively, the derived likelihood is proportional to (1) the concavity of the curvature of the Q-landscape, captured by a weighted average of the neighboring particles' Q-value gradients and (2) pairwise-distances between the neighboring particles ($\\sim\\!\\|a^{l}_{i}\\!-\\!a^{l}_{j}\\|^2\\cdot \\exp{(\\|a^{l}_{i}\\!-\\!a^{l}_{j}\\|^2)}$), \\ie the larger the distance the higher is the entropy.\n\\begin{proposition}[SGLD, HMC]\\label{prop:sgld_invertibility}\nThe SGLD and HMC updates are not invertible w.r.t. $a$. \n\\end{proposition} \n\\proofsketch{SGLD is stochastic (noise term) and thus not injective. HMC is only invertible if conditioned on the velocity $v$.}\\\\\nFrom the above theoretic analysis, we can see that SGLD update is not invertible and hence is not suitable as a sampler for \\STAC. While the HMC update is invertible, its derived closed-form entropy involves calculating Hessian and hence computationally more expensive. Due to these considerations, we choose to use SVGD with an RBF kernel as the underlying sampler of \\STAC.\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n## Experimental Setup\n\n```json\n[{\"name\": \"Sanity Check on Entropy Estimate\", \"description\": \"This experiment evaluates the merit of the derived SVGD-based entropy estimate on target distributions with known entropy values (e.g., Gaussian) or log-likelihoods (e.g., Gaussian Mixture Models).

To achieve this, it maximizes the sum of expected future reward and expected future entropy. It is different from entropy regularization~\\citep{schulman2015trust,o2016combining,schulman2017proximal} which maximizes entropy at the current time step. It is also different from multi-modal RL approaches \\citep{tang2018boosting} which recover different modes with equal frequencies without considering their future entropy. MaxEnt RL has been broadly incorporated in various RL domains, including inverse RL~\\citep{ziebart2008maximum,finn2016guided}, stochastic control~\\citep{rawlik2012stochastic,toussaint2009robot}, guided policy search~\\citep{levine2013guided}, and off-policy learning~\\citep{haarnoja2018soft,haarnoja2018soft1}. MaxEnt RL is shown to maximize a lower bound of the robust RL objective~\\citep{eysenbach2022maximum} and is hence less sensitive to perturbations in state and reward functions. From the variational inference lens, MaxEnt RL aims to find the policy distribution that minimizes the \\textit{KL}-divergence to an EBM over Q-function. The desired family of variational distributions is (1) expressive enough to capture the intricacies of the Q-value landscape (\\eg multimodality) and (2) has a tractable entropy estimate. These two requirements are hard to satisfy. SAC~\\citep{haarnoja2018soft} uses a Gaussian policy. Despite having a tractable entropy, it fails to capture arbitrary Q-value landscapes. SAC-GMM~\\citep{haarnoja2018acquiring} extends SAC by modeling the policy as a Gaussian Mixture Model, but it requires an impractical grid search over the number of components. Other extensions include IAPO \\citep{marino2021iterative} which also models the policy as a uni-modal Gaussian but learns a collection of parameter estimates (mean, variance) through different initializations. While this yields multi-modality, it does not optimize a MaxEnt objective. SSPG \\citep{cetin2022policy} and SAC-NF \\citep{mazoure2020leveraging} respectively improve the policy expressivity by modeling the policy as a Markov chain with Gaussian transition probabilities and as a normalizing flow. Due to training instability, the reported multi-goal experiments in \\citep{cetin2022policy} show that, though both models capture multimodality, they fail to maximize the expected future entropy in positive reward setups. SQL \\citep{haarnoja2017reinforcement}, on the other hand, bypasses the explicit entropy computation altogether via a soft version of value iteration. It then trains an amortized SVGD \\citep{wang2016learning} sampler from the EBM over the learned Q-values. However, estimating soft value functions requires approximating integrals via importance sampling which is known to have high variance and poor scalability. We propose a new family of variational distributions induced by a parameterized SVGD sampler from the EBM over Q-values. Our policy is expressive and captures multi-modal distributions while being characterized by a tractable entropy estimate. \\\\\n\\textbf{EBMs} \\citep{lecun2006tutorial,wu2018sparse} are represented as Gibbs densities $p(x) = \\exp{E(x)}/Z$, where $E(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ is an energy function describing inter-variable dependencies and $Z= \\int \\exp{E(x)}$ is the partition function. Despite their expressiveness, EBMs are not tractable as the partition function requires integrating over an exponential number of configurations. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods \\citep{van2018simple} (\\eg HMC~\\citep{hoffman2014no}, SGLD~\\citep{welling2011bayesian}) are frequently used to approximate the partition function via sampling. There have been recent efforts to parameterize these samplers via deepnets \\citep{levy2017generalizing,gong2018meta,feng2017learning} to improve scalability. Similarly to these methods, we propose a parameterized variant of SVGD \\citep{liu2016stein} as an EBM sampler to enable scalability to high-dimensional action spaces. Beyond sampling, we derive a closed-form expression of the sampling distribution as an estimate of the EBM. This yields a tractable estimate of the entropy. This is opposed to previous methods for estimating EBM entropy which mostly rely on heuristic approximation, lower bounds \\cite{dai2017calibrating,dai2019kernel}, or neural estimators of mutual information \\citep{kumar2018engan}. The idea of approximating the entropy of EBMs via MCMC sampling by leveraging the change of variable formula was first proposed in \\cite{dai2019exponential}. The authors apply the formula to HMC and LD, which, as we show previously, violate the invertibility assumption. To go around this, they augment the EBM family with the noise or velocity variable for LD and HMC respectively. We show that SVGD is invertible, and hence we sample from the original EBM, so that our derived entropy is more intuitive as it depends on the SVGD dynamics.\\\\\n\\textbf{SVGD-augmented RL} \\citep{liu2016stein} has been explored under other RL contexts. \\citet{liu2017steinn} use SVGD to learn a distribution over policy parameters. While this leads to learning diverse policies, it is fundamentally different from our approach as we are interested in learning a single multi-modal policy with a closed-form entropy formula. \\citet{castanet2023stein, chen2021variational} use SVGD to sample from multimodal distributions over goals/tasks. We go beyond sampling and use SVGD to derive a closed-form entropy formula of an expressive variational distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nWe propose \\STAC, an actor-critic algorithm that yields a more optimal solution to the MaxEnt RL objective than previously proposed approaches. \\STAC\\ achieves this by leveraging a new family of variational distributions characterized by SVGD dynamics. The proposed distribution has high expressivity, \\ie it is flexible enough to capture multimodal policies in high dimensional spaces, and a tractable entropy estimate. Empirical results show that \\STAC\\ learns expressive and robust policies while having superior performance than other MaxEnt RL algorithms.

                "abstract": "We study optimization problems in a metric space $(\\mathcal{X},d)$ where we can compute distances in two ways: via a ''strong'' oracle that returns exact distances $d(x,y)$, and a ''weak'' oracle that returns distances $\\tilde{d}(x,y)$ which may be arbitrarily corrupted with some probability. This model captures the increasingly common trade-off between employing both an expensive similarity model (e.g. a large-scale embedding model), and a less accurate but cheaper model. Hence, the goal is to make as few queries to the strong oracle as possible. We consider both so-called ''point queries'', where the strong oracle is queried on a set of points $S \\subset \\mathcal{X} $ and returns $d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \\in S$, and ''edge queries'' where it is queried for individual distances $d(x,y)$. Our main contributions are optimal algorithms and lower bounds for clustering and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in this model. For $k$-centers, $k$-median, and $k$-means, we give constant factor approximation algorithms with only $\\tilde{O}(k)$ strong oracle point queries, and prove that $\\Omega(k)$ queries are required for any bounded approximation. For edge queries, our upper and lower bounds are both $\\tilde{\\Theta}(k^2)$. Surprisingly, for the MST problem we give a $O(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ approximation algorithm using no strong oracle queries at all, and a matching $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\log n})$ lower bound. We empirically evaluate our algorithms, and show that their quality is comparable to that of the baseline algorithms that are given all true distances, but while querying the strong oracle on only a small fraction ($<1\\%$) of points."

However, in practice, there are many machine learning methods available, often with incomparable generalization guarantees, making it hard to pick a best method a priori. In this work we consider scenarios where multiple predictors are available to the algorithm and the question is how to best utilize them. Ideally, we would like the algorithm's performance to depend on the quality of the best predictor. However, utilizing more predictions comes with a cost, since we now have to identify which prediction is the best. We study the use of multiple predictors for a number of fundamental problems, including matching, load balancing, and non-clairvoyant scheduling, which have been well-studied in the single predictor setting. For each of these problems we introduce new algorithms that take advantage of multiple predictors, and prove bounds on the resulting performance."

It has also played a central role in the development of learning-augmented algorithms -- a recent line of research that aims to ameliorate the shortcomings of classical worst-case analysis by giving algorithms access to predictions. Such predictions can typically be generated using a machine learning approach, but they are inherently imperfect. Previous work on learning-augmented paging has investigated predictions on (i) when the current page will be requested again (reoccurrence predictions), (ii) the current state of the cache in an optimal algorithm (state predictions), (iii) all requests until the current page gets requested again, and (iv) the relative order in which pages are requested. We study learning-augmented paging from the new perspective of requiring the least possible amount of predicted information. More specifically, the predictions obtained alongside each page request are limited to one bit only. We consider two natural such setups: (i) discard predictions, in which the predicted bit denotes whether or not it is ``safe'' to evict this page, and (ii) phase predictions, where the bit denotes whether the current page will be requested in the next phase (for an appropriate partitioning of the input into phases). We develop algorithms for each of the two setups that satisfy all three desirable properties of learning-augmented algorithms -- that is, they are consistent, robust and smooth -- despite being limited to a one-bit prediction per request.

We take a first step in this direction by combining the idea of machine-learned predictions with the idea of\"warm-starting\"primal-dual algorithms. We consider one of the most important primitives in combinatorial optimization: weighted bipartite matching and its generalization to $b$-matching. We identify three key challenges when using learned dual variables in a primal-dual algorithm. First, predicted duals may be infeasible, so we give an algorithm that efficiently maps predicted infeasible duals to nearby feasible solutions. Second, once the duals are feasible, they may not be optimal, so we show that they can be used to quickly find an optimal solution. Finally, such predictions are useful only if they can be learned, so we show that the problem of learning duals for matching has low sample complexity. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments on both real and synthetic data. As a result we give a rigorous, practical, and empirically effective method to compute bipartite matchings."

In this paper, we present the first algorithm for weighted flow time which do not require exact knowledge of the processing times of jobs. Specifically, we introduce the Scheduling with Predicted Processing Time (SPPT) problem, where the algorithm is given a prediction for the processing time of each job, instead of its real processing time. For the case of a constant factor distortion between the predictions and the real processing time, our algorithms match all the best known competitiveness bounds for weighted flow time – namely O(logP), O(logD) and O(logW), where P,D,W are the maximum ratios of processing times, densities, and weights, respectively.

They provide robustness-consistency trade-offs for a variety of online problems. However, they leave open the question of whether these trade-offs are tight, i.e., to what extent to such trade-offs are necessary. In this paper, we provide the first set of non-trivial lower bounds for competitive analysis using machine-learned predictions.

The makespan minimization problem with restricted assignments is a classic problem in online scheduling theory. Worst case analysis of this problem gives Ω(log m ) lower bounds on the competitive ratio in the online setting.

Our predictions are compact in size, having dimension linear in the number of machines, and can be learned using standard oﬀ the shelf methods. The performance guarantees of our algorithms depend on the accuracy of the predictions, given predictions with error η , we show how to construct O (log η ) competitive fractional assignments. We then give an online algorithm that rounds any fractional assignment into an integral schedule. Our algorithm is O ((log log m ) 3 )-competitive and we give a nearly matching ˜Ω(log log m ) lower bound for online rounding algorithms. 1 Altogether, we give algorithms that, equipped with predictions with error η , achieve O (log η (log log m ) 3 ) competitive ratios, breaking the Ω(log m ) lower bound even for moderately accurate predictions."

On the other hand, machine learning algorithms are in the business of extrapolating patterns found in the data to predict the future, and usually come with strong guarantees on the expected generalization error.\n In this work, we develop a framework for augmenting online algorithms with a machine learned predictor to achieve competitive ratios that provably improve upon unconditional worst-case lower bounds when the predictor has low error. Our approach treats the predictor as a complete black box and is not dependent on its inner workings or the exact distribution of its errors.\n \n We apply this framework to the traditional caching problem—creating an eviction strategy for a cache of size\n k\n . We demonstrate that naively following the oracle’s recommendations may lead to very poor performance, even when the average error is quite low. Instead, we show how to modify the Marker algorithm to take into account the predictions and prove that this combined approach achieves a competitive ratio that both (i) decreases as the predictor’s error decreases and (ii) is always capped by\n O\n (log\n k\n ), which can be achieved without any assistance from the predictor. We complement our results with an empirical evaluation of our algorithm on real-world datasets and show that it performs well empirically even when using simple off-the-shelf predictions.\n"

In this study, for the first time, a dynamic model and algorithm for short-term supply chain scheduling in smart factories Industry 4.0 is presented. The peculiarity of the considered problem is the simultaneous consideration of both machine structure selection and job assignments. The scheduling approach is based on a dynamic non-stationary interpretation of the execution of the jobs and a temporal decomposition of the scheduling problem. The algorithmic realisation is based on a modified form of the continuous maximum principle blended with mathematical optimisation. A detailed theoretical analysis of the temporal decomposition and computational complexity is performed. The optimality conditions as well as the structural properties of the model and the algorithm are investigated. Advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed."

This makes reconfigurable platforms an ideal target for many modern embedded systems that combine high computation demands with dynamic task sets. A rather new line of research is engaged in the construction of operating systems for reconfigurable embedded platforms. Such an operating system provides a minimal programming model and a runtime system. The runtime system performs online task and resource management. In this paper, we first discuss design issues for reconfigurable hardware operating systems. Then, we focus on a runtime system for guarantee-based scheduling of hard real-time tasks. We formulate the scheduling problem for the 1D and 2D resource models and present two heuristics, the horizon and the stuffing technique, to tackle it. Simulation experiments conducted with synthetic workloads evaluate the performance and the runtime efficiency of the proposed schedulers. The scheduling performance for the 1D resource model is strongly dependent on the aspect ratios of the tasks. Compared to the 1D model, the 2D resource model is clearly superior. Finally, the runtime overhead of the scheduling algorithms is shown to be acceptably low."

We consider a variety of scheduling, batching, and delivery problems that arise in an arborescent supply chain where a supplier makes deliveries to several manufacturers, who also make deliveries to customers. The objective is to minimize the overall scheduling and delivery cost, using several classical scheduling objectives. This is achieved by scheduling the jobs and forming them into batches, each of which is delivered to the next downstream stage as a single shipment. For each problem, we either derive an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that minimizes the total cost of the supplier or that of the manufacturer, or we demonstrate that this problem is intractable. The total system cost minimization problem of a supplier and manufacturer who make cooperative decisions is also considered. We demonstrate that cooperation between a supplier and a manufacturer may reduce the total system cost by at least 20%, or 25%, or by up to 100%, depending upon the scheduling objective. Finally, we identify incentives and mechanisms for this cooperation, thereby demonstrating that our work has practical implications for improving the efficiency of supply chains."

Despite this fact, SRPT scheduling is rarely used in practice. It is believed that the performance improvements of SRPT over other scheduling policies stem from the fact that SRPT unfairly penalizes the large jobs in order to help the small jobs. This belief has led people to instead adopt \"fair\" scheduling policies such as Processor-Sharing (PS), which produces the same expected slowdown for jobs of all sizes.This paper investigates formally the problem of unfairness in SRPT scheduling as compared with PS scheduling. The analysis assumes an M/G/1 model, and emphasizes job size distributions with a heavy-tailed property, as are characteristic of empirical workloads. The analysis shows that the degree of unfairness under SRPT is surprisingly small.The M/G/1/SRPT and M/G/1/PS queues are also analyzed under overload and closed-form expressions for mean response time as a function of job size are proved in this setting."

We find that, contrary to previous reports, the performance benefits of preemptive migration are significantly greater than those of non-preemptive migration, even when the memory-transfer cost is high. Using a model of migration costs representative of current systems, we find that preemptive migration reduces the mean delay (queueing and migration) by 35 - 50%, compared to non-preemptive migration."

The reasons for these choices are simplicity and speed in the operating system, but the cost to the system in terms of reliability and maintainability have not generally been assessed. This paper originates from the notion that the primary distinguishing characteristic of a real-time system is the concept that completion of a process or a set of processes has a value to the system which can be expressed as a function of time. This notion is described in terms of a time-driven scheduling model for real-time operating systems and provides a tool for measuring the effectiveness of most of the currently used process schedulers in real-time systems. Applying this model, we have constructed a multiprocessor real-time system simulator with which we measure a number of well-known scheduling algorithms such as Shortest Process Time (SPT), Deadline, Shortest Slack Time, FIFO, and a fixed priority scheduler, with respect to the resulting total system values. This approach to measuring the process scheduling effectiveness is a first step in our longer term effort to produce a scheduler which will explicitly schedule real-time processes in such a way that their execution times maximize their collective value to the system, either in a shared memory multiprocessing environment or in multiple nodes of a distributed processing environment."

                "abstract": "1. Introduction The study of expected running time of algoritruns is an interesting subject from both a theoretical and a practical point of view. Basically there exist two approaches to this study. In the first approach (we shall call it the distributional approach), some \"natural\" distribution is assumed for the input of a problem, and one looks for fast algorithms under this assumption (see Knuth [8J). For example, in sorting n numbers, it is usually assumed that all n! initial orderings of the numbers are equally likely. A common criticism of this approach is that distributions vary a great deal in real life situations; fu.rthermore, very often the true distribution of the input is simply not known. An alternative approach which attempts to overcome this shortcoming by allowing stochastic moves in the computation has recently been proposed. This is the randomized approach made popular by Habin [lOJ(also see Gill[3J, Solovay and Strassen [13J), although the concept was familiar to statisticians (for exa'1lple, see Luce and Raiffa [9J). Note that by allowing stochastic moves in an algorithm, the input is effectively being randomized. We shall refer to such an algoritlvn as a randomized algorithm. These two approaches lead naturally to two different definitions of intrinsic complexity of a problem, which we term the distributional complexity and the randomized complexity, respectively. (Precise definitions and examples will be given in Sections 2 and 3.) To solidify the ideas, we look at familiar combinatorial problems that can be modeled by decision trees. In particular, we consider (a) the testing of an arbitrary graph property from an adjacency matrix (Section 2), and (b) partial order problems on n We will show that for these two classes of problems, the two complexity measures always agree by virtue of a famous theorem, the Minimax Theorem of Von Neumann [14J. The connection between the two approaches lends itself to applications. With two different views (and in a sense complementary to each other) on the complexity of a problem, it is frequently easier to derive upper and lower bounds. For example, using adjacency matrix representation for a graph, it can be shown that no randomized algorithm can determine 2 the existence of a perfect matching in less than O(n) probes. Such lower bounds to the randomized approach were lacking previously. As another example of application , we can prove that for the partial order problems in (b), assuming uniform …"

In this paper, we consider a cost associated with making predictions. We show that interesting algorithmic subtleties arise for even the most basic online problems, such as ski rental and its generalization, the Bahncard problem. In particular, we show that with costly predictions, care needs to be taken in (i) asking for the prediction at the right time, (ii) deciding if it is worth asking for the prediction, and (iii) how many predictions we ask for, in settings where it is natural to consider making multiple predictions. Specifically, (i) in the basic ski-rental setting, we compute the optimal delay before asking the predictor, (ii) in the same setting, given apriori information about the true number of ski-days through its mean and variance, we provide a simple algorithm that is near-optimal, under some natural parameter settings, in deciding if it is worth asking for the predictor and (iii) in the setting of the Bahncard problem, we provide a (1 + ε ) -approximation al-gorithm and quantify lower bounds on the number of queries required to do so.

We demonstrate how to more effectively utilize historical datasets and application domain knowledge by intentionally using predictors of different quantities. By leveraging the heterogeneity in our predictors, we are able to achieve improved performance, explainability, and computational efﬁciency over predictor-agnostic methods. Theoretical results are supplemented by large-scale empirical evaluations with production data demonstrating the success of our methods on optimization problems occurring in large distributed computing systems."

                "\n\n\n\nOptimal job scheduling is a longstanding and actively studied class of optimization problems \\cite{panwalkar1977survey, lenstra1978complexity, graham1979optimization, martel1982preemptive, cheng1990state, lawler1993sequencing,  pinedo2012scheduling}, with applications in various domains spanning from supply chain management \\cite{hall2003supply, ivanov2016dynamic} to operating systems \\cite{jensen1985time, ramamritham1994scheduling, steiger2004operating}.\nA particular setting is preemptive single-machine scheduling \\cite{pinedo2012scheduling, baker2013principles}, where $n$ jobs $i \\in [n]$ must be executed on the same machine, with the possibility of interrupting a job and resuming it afterward, and the objective is to minimize the sum of their completion times. An algorithm is called \\textit{clairvoyant} if it has initial access to the job sizes, otherwise, it is called \\textit{non-clairvoyant} \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}.\nThe design of non-clairvoyant scheduling algorithms is a classical problem in competitive analysis and online algorithms \\cite{borodin2005online}. In this paradigm, decisions must be made in an environment where the parameters governing the outcome are unknown or might evolve over time. \nDue to the inherent difficulty of the problems in competitive analysis, the performance of any online algorithm stays bounded away from that of the optimal offline algorithm. However, the ascent of machine learning motivated the incorporation of predictions in algorithm design, which started in works such as \\cite{munoz2017revenue, kraska2018case}, then was formalized in \\cite{lykouris2018competitive} and \\cite{purohit2018improving}. Since then, \\textit{learning-augmented algorithms} became a popular research topic and had multiple applications \\cite{mitzenmacher2022algorithms}.\nThe outcome of these algorithms depends both on the parameters of the problem and the quality of the predictions. They are required to have a performance that is near-optimal when the predictions are accurate (consistency), near the worst-case performance without advice if the predictions are arbitrarily erroneous (robustness), and that degrades smoothly as the prediction error increases (smoothness).\nIn practice, predictions often incur costs and, at times, are infeasible due to the lack of data. It is, therefore, crucial to understand the limitations and the feasible improvements with a restrained number of predictions in scenarios with multiple unknown variables. This question was first investigated for the caching problem \\cite{im2022parsimonious}, and very recently for metrical task systems \\cite{sadek2024algorithms}, in settings where the algorithm is allowed to query a limited number of predictions. It was also explored for the scheduling problem \\cite{benomar2023advice}, assuming that the decision-maker can query the true sizes of $B$ jobs out of $n$. The authors present a $\\big(2-\\tfrac{B(B-1)}{n(n-1)}\\big)$-competitive algorithm, and they give a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any algorithm only when $B = o(n)$. The case of imperfect predictions, however, is not examined. \nIn non-clairvoyant scheduling, besides the querying model studied in the works mentioned above, predictions of the sizes of certain jobs $i \\in I$ may be available, where $I \\subset [n]$, perhaps derived from previous executions of similar tasks. %Importantly, $I$ is a random subset beyond the influence of the decision-maker or the adversary controlling the job sizes. We assume that $I$ is a subset of $[n]$ of size $B$ taken uniformly at random.\nAssuming that $I$ is a subset of $[n]$ of size $B$, taken uniformly at random,\nwe examine the limitations and possible improvements of non-clairvoyant algorithms.\n\n\n\\subsection{Contributions}\nWe initiate our analysis by addressing the scenario of perfect predictions. We establish a lower bound on the $(n, B)$-competitive ratio of any algorithm (for fixed $n \\geq 2$ and $B \\leq n$), which extends the lower bound of $2 - \\frac{4}{n+3}$ in the non-clairvoyant case \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}. Considering that $B =  wn + o(n)$ for some $w \\in [0,1]$, we derive from the prior bound that the competitive ratio of any algorithm is at least $2 - w - (\\frac{4}{e}-1)w(1-w)$, and we show an improved bound of $2 - w - (3-2\\sqrt{2})w(1-w)$.  Demonstrating these bounds is considerably more challenging than the case $B = 0$, due to the eventual dependency between the actions of the algorithm and the known job sizes.\n \n\nIn the case of perfect predictions, we show that knowing only the relative order of the $B$ job sizes, without knowledge of their values, enables a $(2-\\frac{B}{n})$-competitive algorithm, which improves substantially upon the result of \\cite{benomar2023advice}. \nWe propose a second algorithm leveraging the true sizes of the $B$ jobs, yielding an $(n,B)$-competitive ratio of $(2 - \\frac{B}{n} - \\frac{2(1 - B/n)}{n+1})$, which is strictly better than the former, although both are asymptotically equivalent.\n\n\nSubsequently, we adapt the latter algorithm to handle imperfect predictions. While the difficulty in most works on learning-augmented algorithms lies in ensuring robustness and consistency, smoothness in the case of scheduling with limited predictions is also not immediate.\nAlongside the typical consistency-robustness tradeoff, our algorithm also exhibits a consistency-smoothness tradeoff. More precisely, governed by two hyperparameters $\\lambda, \\rho \\in [0,1]$, the $(n,B)$-competitive ratio of the algorithm is at most \n$\\min(\\frac{2}{1-\\lambda}, \\frac{C}{\\lambda} + \\frac{S}{\\lambda} \\frac{n \\E[\\eta]}{\\OPT})$. \nHere, $\\E[\\eta]$ denotes the total expected prediction error, $\\OPT$ is the objective function achieved by the optimal offline algorithm, $\\frac{2}{1-\\lambda}$ is the algorithm's robustness, $\\frac{C}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(2 - \\frac{B}{n} + \\rho\\frac{B}{n}(1 - \\frac{B-1}{n-1}))$ its consistency, and $\\frac{S}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}( \\frac{4}{\\rho} (1 - \\frac{B}{n}) + \\frac{B}{n})$ its smoothness factor, characterizing the sensitivity of the bound to $\\E[\\eta]$. \nNotably, alterations in the parameter $\\rho$ yield opposing variations on the consistency and the smoothness factor. Nonetheless, this tradeoff vanishes for $B$ close to $0$ or $n$, and does not appear, for instance, in \\cite{purohit2018improving}, \\cite{bampis2022scheduling} or \\cite{lindermayr2022permutation}.\n\nWe illustrate our results for the case of perfect predictions in Figure \\ref{fig:results}, comparing them with the competitive ratio proved in \\cite{benomar2023advice}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\begin{center}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.75\\columnwidth]{figs/results.pdf}}\n\\caption{Lower bounds and competitive ratios for $B$ known job sizes.}\n\\label{fig:results}\n\\end{center}\n\\vskip -0.4in\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Related work}\nSince their introduction in \\cite{purohit2018improving, lykouris2018competitive}, learning-augmented algorithms witnessed an exponentially growing interest, as they offered a fresh perspective for revisiting online algorithms, and provided new applications for machine learning in algorithm design \\cite{mitzenmacher2022algorithms} and in the implementation of data structures \\cite{kraska2018case, lin2022learning}. Many fundamental problems in competitive analysis were studied in this setting, such as ski rental \\cite{gollapudi2019online, anand2020customizing, bamas2020primal, diakonikolas2021learning, antoniadis2021learning, maghakian2023applied, shin2023improved}, secretary \\cite{antoniadis2020secretary, dutting2021secretaries}, matching \\cite{dinitz2021faster, chen2022faster, sakaue2022discrete, jin2022online}, caching and metrical task systems \\cite{lykouris2018competitive, chlkedowski2021robust, antoniadis2023online, antoniadis2023paging, christianson2023optimal}. \nIn particular, scheduling is one of the problems that were studied most thoroughly. Different works cover various objective functions \\cite{purohit2018improving, lattanzi2020online, azar2021flow}, prediction types \\cite{antoniadis2021novel, merlis2023preemption, lassota2023minimalistic}, error metrics \\cite{im2021non, lindermayr2022permutation}, and other aspects and applications \\cite{wei2020optimal, bamas2020learning, dinitz2022algorithms}\n\nThe setting of learning-augmented algorithms with limited predictions was initially explored by \\citet{im2022parsimonious} for caching. The authors presented an algorithm using parsimonious predictions, with a competitive ratio increasing with the number of allowed queries. In another very recent paper \\cite{sadek2024algorithms}, a similar setting is studied for the more general problem of metrical task systems, where the algorithm is allowed to query a reduced number of \\textit{action predictions} \\cite{antoniadis2023online}, each giving the state of an optimal algorithm at the respective query step. An additional related study by \\citet{drygala2023online} focuses on the ski-rental and Bahncard problems in a penalized adaptation of the setting with limited advice, where the cost of the predictions is added to the algorithm's objective function. \nOther works have explored related settings with different types of limited advice. For instance, the setting with a restricted number of perfect hints was examined in the context of online linear optimization by \\citep{bhaskara2021logarithmic} and in the multi-color secretary problem by \\citep{benomar2023addressing}. Another setting, where the algorithm can query two types of hints—one that is free but possibly inaccurate, and another that is expensive but accurate—has been studied in several problems, such as correlation clustering \\citep{silwal2023kwikbucks}, computing minimum spanning trees in a metric space \\citep{bateni2023metric}, sorting \\cite{bai2024sorting}, and matroid optimization \\citep{eberle2024accelerating}.\nIn the context of scheduling, \\citet{benomar2023advice} introduced the $B$-clairvoyant scheduling problem, where an algorithm can query the exact sizes of $B$ jobs at any moment during its execution. They show that the optimal strategy involves querying the sizes of $B$ jobs selected uniformly at random at the beginning of the process. They establish that, if $B = o(n)$, then the competitive ratio of any algorithm is at least $2$, then they provide a $\\big(2-\\frac{B(B-1)}{n(n-1)}\\big)$-competitive algorithm. The same paper also addresses the secretary problem with restricted access to binary predictions of known accuracy, and the ski-rental problem with access to an oracle whose accuracy improves progressively over time. \n\nThe limit scenario $B = 0$ corresponds to the non-clairvoyant scheduling problem, studied in-depth in \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}. In particular, the paper demonstrates that the competitive ratio of any non-clairvoyant algorithm is at least $2$, and that it is achieved by the \\textit{round-robin} algorithm, executing all unfinished jobs concurrently at equal rates. On the other hand, $B=n$ corresponds to the setting presented in \\cite{purohit2018improving}, where the authors introduce, for all $\\lambda \\in (0,1)$, a \\textit{preferential round-robin} algorithm with robustness $\\frac{2}{1-\\lambda}$ and consistency $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{Problem and notations}\nThe decision-maker is given $n$ jobs $i \\in [n]$ with unknown sizes $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ to schedule on a single machine, and predictions $(y_i)_{i \\in I}$ of $(x_i)_{i \\in I}$, with $I$ a uniformly random subset of $[n]$ of size $B$. The objective is to leverage the available predictions to minimize the sum of the completion times. We assume that preemption is allowed, i.e. it is possible to interrupt the execution of a job and resume it later, which is equivalent, by neglecting the preemption cost, to assuming that the jobs can be run in parallel at rates that sum to at most $1$.\n\nTo simplify the presentation, we consider that there are predictions $y_1,\\ldots,y_n$ of $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$, but the decision-maker has only access to $y_{\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, y_{\\sigma(B)}$, where $\\sigma$ is a uniformly random permutation of $[n]$. We denote by $\\eta_i = |x_i - y_i|$ the error of the prediction $y_i$, \nand by $\\eta^\\sigma = \\sum_{i=1}^B \\eta_{\\sigma(i)}$ the total error of the predictions accessed by the algorithm. \nConsider an algorithm $\\A$ and an instance $x = (x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ of job sizes, we denote by $\\A(x)$ the sum of the completion times of all the jobs when executed by $\\A$.\nFurthermore, for all $i \\neq j \\in [n]$ and $t>0$, we denote by \n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\spt_i^\\A(t)$ the processing time spent on job $i$ until time $t$,\n    \\item $t_i^\\A = \\inf\\{ t \\geq 0: \\spt_i^\\A(t) = x_i\\}$ its completion time,\n    \\item $D^\\A_{ij} = \\spt_i^\\A(t^\\A_j)$ the total time spent on job $i$ before job $j$ terminates,\n    \\item and $P^\\A_{ij} = D^\\A_{ij} + D^\\A_{ji}$ the mutual delay caused by $i,j$ to each other.\n\\end{itemize}\nWhen there is no ambiguity, we omit writing the dependency to $\\A$.\nWith these notations, it holds that $t^\\A_i = x_i + \\sum_{j \\neq i} D^\\A_{ji}$ for all $i \\in [n]$. Consequently, the objective function of $\\A$ can be expressed as\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:generic-output}\n\\A(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n} P^\\A_{ij} \\;.    \n\\end{equation}\nObserving that, for all $i \\neq j \\in [n]$, if $i$ terminates before $j$ then $P^\\A_{ij} \\geq x_i$, otherwise $P^\\A_{ij} \\geq x_j$, we deduce that $P^\\A_{ij} \\geq \\min(x_i, x_j)$. Equality is achieved by the clairvoyant algorithm that runs the jobs until completion in non-decreasing size order \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}, which is the optimal offline algorithm, that we denote $\\OPT$, satisfying\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:opt-output}\n\\OPT(x)\n= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n} \\min(x_i,x_j)\\;.\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nWhen the predictions are perfect, for all $n \\geq 2$ and $B \\leq n$, we define the $(n,B)$-competitive ratio of algorithm $\\A$ as the worst-case ratio between its objective, knowing the sizes of $B$ jobs taken uniformly at random, and that of $\\OPT$, on instances of $n$ jobs\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\ratio_{n,B}(\\A) = \\sup_{x\\in (0,\\infty)^n} \\frac{\\E[\\A(x)]}{\\OPT(x)}\\;,\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere the expectation $\\E[\\A(x)]$ is taken over the permutation $\\sigma$ and the actions of $\\A$ if it a randomized algorithm. \n\nIf the number of predictions depends on the number of jobs, i.e.  $B = (B_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ defines a sequence of integers, then the competitive ratio of $\\A$ is defined by\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\CR_B(\\A) = \\sup_{n \\geq 2} \\ratio_{n,B_n}(\\A)\\;.\n\\end{equation*}\nWhen the predictions are imperfect, the competitive ratio becomes also a function of $\\E[\\eta^\\sigma]$. \n\n"

                "Lower Bounds",
                "In this section, we assume that the predictions are error-free, and we establish lower bounds on the $(n,B)$-competitive ratio of any algorithm, followed by a lower bound independent of $n$ when $B_n = w n + o(n)$ for some $w \\in [0,1]$.\nThese lower bounds are obtained by constructing random job size instances $x$ such that, for any deterministic algorithm $\\A$, the ratio $\\E_{\\sigma,x}[\\A(x)]/ \\E_x[\\OPT(x)]$ is above them. The result then extends to randomized algorithms and yields bounds on their $(n,B)$-competitive ratio by using Lemma \\ref{lem:yao}, which is a consequence of Yao's principle \\cite{yao1977probabilistic}. \n\nIn all this section, we consider i.i.d. job sizes. Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that the $B$ known job sizes are $x_1,\\ldots,x_B$. \n\nIn the non-clairvoyant case $B=0$, for any algorithm $\\A$, taking i.i.d. exponentially distributed sizes gives, with easy computation, that $\\E[P^\\A_{ij}] = 1$ (Remark \\ref{rmk:uij-nonclairvoyant}), which yields, using Equations \\eqref{eq:generic-output} and \\eqref{eq:opt-output}, the lower bound $2 - \\frac{4}{n+3}$ on the competitive ratio \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}. However, if $B > 0$, the algorithm can act according to the information it has on $(x_i)_{i \\in I}$, and the dependence between its actions and these job sizes makes the analysis more sophisticated.\nFor any positive and continuous function $\\phi$, and positive numbers $T \\geq x > 0$ we denote\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:Gphi}\nG_\\phi(x,T) = \\int_0^{T-x} \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)} + \\frac{x}{\\phi(T-x)}\\;.\n\\end{equation}\nWe prove in the following theorem a generic lower bound, using job sizes sampled independently from the distribution $\\Pr(x_i \\leq t) = 1-\\frac{\\varphi(0)}{\\varphi(t)}$.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:lower-bound}\nLet $\\phi : [0,\\infty) \\to [0,\\infty)$ be a continuously differentiable and increasing function satisfying $\\phi(0) > 0$, $\\phi'/\\phi$ is non-increasing and  $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)^2} < \\infty$, and let $\\alpha_\\phi$ a non-negative constant satisfying\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:thm-lb-eq}\n\\int_0^\\infty \\left\\{ \\inf_{T \\geq x} G_\\phi(x,T) \\right\\} \\frac{\\phi'(x)}{\\phi(x)^2} dx\n\\geq \\alpha_\\phi \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)^2}\\;.    \n\\end{equation}\nIf $B = wn + o(n)$ for some $w \\in [0,1]$, then it holds for any randomized algorithm $\\A$ that\n\\[\n\\CR_B(\\A) \\geq 2 - 2(2-\\alpha_\\phi) w + (3 - 2\\alpha_\\phi)w^2\\;.\n\\]\nMoreover, if $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)} < \\infty$, then for all $n \\geq 2$ and $B \\leq n$ \n\\[\n\\ratio_{n,B}(\\A)\n\\geq C_{\\phi,n,B} - \\frac{C_{\\phi,n,B} - 1}{1+ \\frac{n-1}{2} \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)^2}}{\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)}}} \\;,\n\\]\nwhere $C_{\\phi,n,B} \n= (2 - \\tfrac{B}{n}) - (3 - 2 \\alpha_\\phi) \\tfrac{B}{n}\\big(1 - \\tfrac{B-1}{n-1} \\big)$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nTo establish this theorem, we analyze i.i.d. job sizes sampled from the distribution $\\Pr(x_i \\leq t) = 1-\\frac{\\varphi(0)}{\\varphi(t)}$. We derive in Lemma \\ref{lem:generic-lb} a lower bound on the mutual delays incurred by these jobs during the run of any algorithm $\\A$. This involves solving a functional minimization problem, whose solution is expressed using the function $G_\\phi$ defined in \\eqref{eq:Gphi}. The left term in Inequality \\eqref{eq:thm-lb-eq} is proportional to the obtained lower bound, while the right term is proportional to $\\E[\\min(x_i,x_j)]$, which is the mutual delay caused in a run of $\\OPT$. Finally, using the identity \\eqref{eq:generic-output}, this inequality, which relates the mutual delays caused respectively by executing $\\A$ and $\\OPT$ on the chosen job sizes, can be extended to an inequality involving the objectives of both algorithms, giving a lower bound on the competitive ratio.\n\nIf $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)} = \\infty$, the expectation of the job sizes is infinite. In this case, we consider a truncated distribution with a maximum $a > 0$. After completing the analysis, we derive a lower bound that depends on $a$ and $w$, by considering $B = wn + o(n)$ and $n \\to \\infty$, then, we conclude by taking the limit $a \\to \\infty$.\nFor any value $\\alpha_\\phi$ in Theorem \\ref{thm:lower-bound}, observe that $C_{\\phi,n,0} = 2$ and $C_{\\phi,n,n} = 1$, which means that the lower bound interpolates properly the non-clairvoyant and clairvoyant settings. The remaining task is to choose an adequate function $\\phi$ satisfying the conditions of the theorem with $\\alpha_\\phi$ as large as possible. We first consider exponentially distributed job sizes, often used to prove lower bounds in scheduling problems.

However, the bound is not tight for all values of $B \\leq n$. To refine it, we consider distributions that would be more difficult to process by the algorithm. One idea is to sample a different parameter $\\lambda_i \\sim \\mathcal{E}(1)$ independently for each $i \\in [n]$, then sample $x_i \\sim \\mathcal{E}(\\lambda_i)$. The distribution of $x_i$ in this case is given by\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(x_i \\geq t) \n&= \\int_0^\\infty \\Pr(x_i \\geq t \\mid \\lambda_i = \\lambda) e^{-\\lambda} d\\lambda\\\\\n&= \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(1+t)\\lambda} d\\lambda\n= \\frac{1}{1+t}\\;,    \n\\end{align*}\n\nwhich corresponds to $\\phi(t) = 1+t$. More generally, we consider $\\phi(t) = (1+t)^r$ for $r \\in (\\tfrac{1}{2},1]$. \nSuch functions $\\phi$ correspond to distributions with a heavy tale and with infinite expectation (i.e. $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)} = \\infty$). Using Theorem \\ref{thm:lower-bound}, they only yield lower bounds on the competitive ratio but not on $\\ratio_{n,B}$. Corollary \\ref{cor:lb-phir} shows the bound obtained for $r \\to \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n\\begin{corollary}\\label{cor:lb-phir}\nLet $w \\in [0,1]$.

                "\nBefore investigating the problem within the learning-augmented framework, we introduce an algorithm exclusively for the scenario with perfect information. Subsequently, in Section \\ref{sec:switch}, we present a second algorithm, that we adapt to handle possibly erroneous predictions.\n\nThe optimal algorithm $\\OPT$ does not necessitate precise knowledge of job sizes. Instead, it relies solely on their ordering. This observation suggests that it might be possible to improve the competitive ratio of the non-clairvoyant case by only knowing the relative order of a subset of the job sizes.\nTherefore, rather than having access to the values $x_{\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, x_{\\sigma(B)}$, we assume that the decision-maker is only given a priority ordering $\\pi$ of them, i.e. a bijection $\\pi : [B] \\to \\sigma([B])$ satisfying $x_{\\pi(1)} \\leq \\ldots \\leq x_{\\pi(B)}$. \n\n\\begin{algorithm}[h!]\n   \\caption{Catch-up and Resume Round-Robin ($\\CRRR$)}\n   \\label{algo:orderonly}\n\\begin{algorithmic}\n   \\STATE {\\bfseries Input:} Ordering $\\pi$ of $x_{\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, x_{\\sigma(1)}$\n   \\STATE Set $x_{\\pi(0)} = 0$\n   \\FOR{$i=1$ {\\bfseries to} $B$}\n        \\STATE Run job $\\pi(i)$ for $x_{\\pi(i-1)}$ units of time\n        \\WHILE{job $\\pi(i)$ is not finished}\n            \\STATE Run round-robin on $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j>B} \\cup \\{\\pi(i)\\}$\n        \\ENDWHILE\n   \\ENDFOR\n   \\STATE Run round-robin on $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j=B+1}^n$ until completion\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\nIn Algorithm \\ref{algo:orderonly} ($\\CRRR$), for all $i \\in [B]$, the execution of job $\\pi(i)$ starts only upon the completion of job $\\pi(i-1)$. At this moment, all jobs $\\sigma(j)$ for $j > B$ are either completed or have undergone execution for $x_{\\pi(i-1)}$ units of time. $\\CRRR$ then runs job $\\pi(i)$ for a period of length $x_{\\pi(i-1)}$ to catch up with the progress of the jobs $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j>B}$. Following this synchronization phase, it runs round-robin on the set of jobs $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j>B} \\cup \\{\\pi(i)\\}$ until $\\pi(i)$ terminates. The same process iterates with $\\pi(i+1)$ afterward.\nOnce all the jobs $\\sigma(i)$ for $i \\in [B]$ are completed, the algorithm runs round robin on the unfinished jobs in $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j >B}$.\n\nLeveraging the ordering $\\pi$, the algorithm aims to minimize the delays caused by longer jobs to shorter ones. In the ideal scenario where $B=n$, each job begins execution only after all shorter ones have been completed. When $B<n$, it is evident that the jobs $\\{\\sigma(i)\\}_{i \\in [B]}$ should be executed in the order specified by $\\pi$. However, $\\CRRR$ takes advantage of this ordering even further, ensuring that job $x_{\\pi(i)}$ not only avoids delaying $x_{\\pi(i-1)}$ but also does not delay any job $\\sigma(j)$ with $j>B$ that has a size at most $x_{\\pi(i-1)}$.\n\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:orderonly}\nAlgorithm  $\\CRRR$ satisfies\n\\[\n2 - \\frac{B}{n}  \n - \\frac{2(1-\\frac{B}{n})}{(n+1)(B+1)}\n\\leq \\ratio_{n,B}(\\CRRR) \n\\leq 2 - \\frac{B}{n}\\;.\n\\]\nMoreover, if $B = \\lfloor wn \\rfloor$ for some $w \\in [0,1]$, then $\\CR(\\CRRR) = 2 - w$.\n\\end{theorem}\nTheorem \\ref{thm:orderonly} shows a substantially stronger result than the one presented in \\cite{benomar2023advice}, where the algorithm leveraging the values of the job sizes $x_{\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, x_{\\sigma(B)}$ is only $\\big(2 - \\frac{B(B-1)}{n(n-1)}\\big)$-competitive. \n\\paragraph{Action predictions}\nThe information provided to $\\CRRR$ is the order in which the jobs $\\{\\sigma(i)\\}_{i \\in [B]}$ would be executed by $\\OPT$. This corresponds to the error-free scenario of \\textit{action predictions} \\cite{antoniadis2023online, lindermayr2022permutation, lassota2023minimalistic, sadek2024algorithms}, where the decision-maker receives predictions regarding the actions taken by the optimal offline algorithm, rather than numeric predictions of unknown parameters.\nIn the context of the scheduling problem, utilizing the $\\ell_1$ norm to measure the error is not ideal for analyzing the action prediction setting \\cite{im2021non}. Alternative error metrics, which account for the number of inversions in the predicted permutation in comparison to the true one \\cite{lindermayr2022permutation}, would be more suitable. \nTherefore, adapting $\\CRRR$ to imperfect action predictions is left for future research as it requires different considerations. For now, we shift our focus to introducing another algorithm that utilizes not only the priority order induced by the job sizes, but the size values themselves.\n\n"

                "\nWe propose in this section a generic algorithm $\\switch$, which we will adapt in the cases of perfect and imperfect predictions. The algorithm takes as input $n$ jobs with unknown sizes and breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(1)},\\ldots,z_{\\sigma(B)}$ that depend on the predictions of $x_{\\sigma(1)},\\ldots,x_{\\sigma(B)}$, then it alternates running round-robin on the jobs $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j>B}$ and \\textit{Shortest Predicted Job First} (SPJF), introduced in  \\cite{purohit2018improving}, on the jobs $\\{\\sigma(i)\\}_{i \\in [B]}$, where the moment of switching from an algorithm to another is determined by the breakpoints.\n\nAs in Section \\ref{sec:orderonly}, we call \\textit{ordering} of $z_{\\sigma(1)},\\ldots,z_{\\sigma(B)}$ any bijective application $\\pi : [B] \\to \\sigma([B])$ satisfying $z_{\\pi(1)} \\leq \\ldots \\leq z_{\\pi(B)}$. Note that, if the breakpoints are not pairwise distinct, then the ordering is not unique. In that case, $\\switch$ chooses an ordering $\\pi$ uniformly at random. We assume furthermore that the breakpoints induce the same order as the predictions, i.e. $z_{\\sigma(i)} < z_{\\sigma(j)} \\iff y_{\\sigma(i)} < y_{\\sigma(j)}$ for all $i, j \\in [B]$.\n\n\\begin{algorithm}[h!]\n   \\caption{Switch algorithm $\\switch(z^\\sigma,x)$}\n   \\label{algo:switch}\n\\begin{algorithmic}\n   \\STATE {\\bfseries Input:} Breakpoints $z^\\sigma = (z_{\\sigma(i)})_{i \\in [B]}$\n   \\STATE $\\pi \\gets$ ordering of $z^\\sigma$ chosen uniformly at random\\;\n   \\FOR{$i=1$ {\\bfseries to} $B$}\n        \\WHILE{$\\min\\limits_{j>B} \\frac{\\spt_{\\sigma(j)}(t)}{x_{\\sigma(j)}} < 1$ and $\\max\\limits_{j > B}\\spt_{\\sigma(j)}(t) < z_{\\pi(i)}$}\n            \\STATE Run round-robin on $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j=B+1}^n$\n        \\ENDWHILE\n        \\STATE Run job $\\pi(i)$ until completion\n   \\ENDFOR\n   \\STATE Run round-robin on $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j=B+1}^n$ until completion\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\n\nConsider a run of $\\switch$, and let $i \\in [B]$. The first condition for entering the while loop is the existence of $j > B$ such that $\\spt_{\\sigma(j)}(t) < x_{\\sigma(j)}$. This signifies that the jobs $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j>B}$ are not all completed, which is a verification feasible for the decision-maker without knowledge of the sizes $\\{x_{\\sigma(j)}\\}_{j>B}$.\nThe second condition means that no job $\\sigma(j)$ for $j>B$ has been in execution for more than $z_{\\pi(i)}$ units of time. Given that round-robin allocates equal importance to all jobs $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j>B}$, upon exiting the while loop, each job $\\sigma(j)$ is either completed or has been in execution for precisely $z_{\\pi(i)}$ units of time.\nFollowing this step, job $\\pi(i)$ is executed until completion, and the same process recurs for $i+1$.\nThis algorithm ensures that any job $x_{\\sigma(i)}$ with $i \\leq B$ does not delay any other job $j$ whose size is at most $x_j \\leq z_{\\sigma(i)}$, and the delay it causes to jobs not satisfying this condition is exactly $x_{\\sigma(i)}$. This allows efficient control of the mutual delays between the jobs by conveniently choosing the breakpoints.\n\\subsection{Perfect Predictions}\nAssuming that the predictions are perfect, i.e. the decision-maker knows the exact sizes of jobs ${\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, {\\sigma(B)}$, it is possible to set $z_{\\sigma(i)} = x_{\\sigma(i)}$ for all $i \\in [B]$.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:switch-perfect}\nAlgorithm $\\switch$ with breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(i)} = x_{\\sigma(i)}$ for all $i \\in [B]$ satisfies\n\\[\n\\ratio_{n,B}(\\switch) \n= 2 - \\frac{B}{n} - \\frac{2(1 - \\frac{B}{n})}{n+1}\\;.\n\\]\nIn particular, if $B = \\lfloor wn \\rfloor$ for some $w \\in [0,1]$ then $\\CR_B(\\switch) = 2 - w$.\n\\end{theorem}\nNote that the $(n,B)$-competitive ratio above is strictly better than that of $\\CRRR$, presented in Theorem \\ref{thm:orderonly}. However, both algorithms have equivalent performance when $n$ is large. In particular, their competitive ratios coincide when $B = \\lfloor wn \\rfloor$.\n\n\nA slight improvement on the $(n,B)$-competitive ratio can be obtained by introducing randomness into $\\switch$. Indeed, consider the \\textit{Run To Completion} algorithm ($\\textsf{RTC}$) defined in \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}, executing all the jobs until completion in a uniformly random order. Then we have the following result.\n\n\\begin{proposition}\\label{prop:rand-switch}\nThe algorithm that runs $\\textsf{RTC}$ with probability $\\frac{2(n-B)}{n(n+3) - 2B}$, and runs $\\switch$ with breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(i)} = x_{\\sigma(i)}$ for all $i \\in [B]$ with the remaining probability, has an $(n,B)$-competitive ratio of\n\\[\n2 - \\frac{B}{n} - \\frac{2(1 - \\frac{B}{n})(2 - \\frac{B}{n})}{n+3 - \\frac{2B}{n}}\\;.\n\\]\n\\end{proposition}\n\nFor $B=0$, the ratio above becomes $2 - \\frac{4}{n+3}$, which is the best possible in the non-clairvoyant setting.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Imperfect Predictions}\\label{sec:imperfect-pred}\nWe assume in this section that no quality guarantees are given on the predictions $\\{y_{\\sigma(i)}\\}_{i \\in [B]}$. Recall that the total error $\\eta^\\sigma = \\sum_{i=1}^B |x_{\\sigma(i)} - y_{\\sigma(i)}|$ is a random variable because $\\sigma$ is a uniformly random permutation of $[n]$, hence our results will depend on $\\E[\\eta^\\sigma]$.\n\nThe goal\nis to design an algorithm that is consistent, robust, and with a competitive ratio having a smooth dependency to $\\E[\\eta^\\sigma]$.\nWe first study the consistency and smoothness of $\\switch$ with well-chosen breakpoints, then we show that combining it with round-robin as in \\cite{purohit2018improving, lassota2023minimalistic} gives robustness guarantees.\n\nUsing the trivial breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(i)} = y_{\\sigma(i)}$ as in the previous section is not enough to guarantee smoothness. Consider, for example, job sizes all equal to 1, and $B$ predictions $y_{\\sigma(i)} = 1 - \\epsilon$ for an arbitrarily small $\\epsilon$. Blindly following these predictions, taking $z_{\\sigma(i)} = y_{\\sigma(i)}$ for all $i \\in [B]$, results in delaying all jobs with unknown sizes by $B$ time units compared to the case of perfect predictions. This creates a discontinuity in the competitive ratio when $\\epsilon$ becomes positive, proving non-smoothness. Hence, we consider instead randomized breakpoints. \n\n\\begin{algorithm}[h!]\n   \\caption{imperfect predictions $\\switch(\\xi y^\\sigma, x)$}\n   \\label{algo:any-pred}\n\\begin{algorithmic}\n   \\STATE {\\bfseries Input:} predictions $(y_{\\sigma(i)})_{i \\in [B]}$, distribution $F$\n   \\STATE Sample $\\xi \\sim F$\\;\n   \\STATE Run $\\switch$ with breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(i)} = \\xi y_{\\sigma(i)}$\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\nAlgorithm \\ref{algo:any-pred} simply runs $\\switch$ with random breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(i)} = \\xi y_{\\sigma(i)}$. \nThe following lemma gives an upper bound on the algorithm's objective function depending on the distribution $F$ of $\\xi$.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:alg-output-F}\nLet $F$ be a probability distribution on $(0,\\infty)$, and consider the mappings $h_F: (0,\\infty)^2 \\to \\R$ and $g_F: (0,\\infty) \\to \\R$ defined by\n\\begin{align*}\nh_F(s,t) &= t \\cdot {\\textstyle \\Pr_{\\xi\\sim F}}(\\xi < \\tfrac{s}{t})\\\\\ng_F(s) &= (1-s) {\\textstyle \\Pr_{\\xi\\sim F}}(\\xi<s) + \\E_{\\xi\\sim F}[\\xi \\indic{\\xi < s}]\\;.  \n\\end{align*}\nLet $\\beta_F = \\sup_{s \\in (0, 1]}\\frac{g_F(s)}{s}$ and $\\gamma_F = \\sup_{s \\geq 1} (g_F(s) + s)$.

Indeed, as $\\rho$ decreases, the algorithm gains in consistency, but the term $\\left( \\tfrac{4}{\\rho}(1 - \\tfrac{B}{n}) + \\tfrac{B}{n} \\right)$ multiplying $\\E[\\eta^\\sigma]$ becomes larger. However, while setting $\\rho$ close to zero results in an arbitrarily high sensitivity to the error, setting it close to $1$ gives consistency of at most $\\big(2 - \\frac{B(B-1)}{n(n-1)}\\big)$, which is still a decreasing function of $B$, interpolating the values $2$ and $1$ in the clairvoyant and non-clairvoyant cases. This implies that sacrificing a small amount of consistency significantly improves smoothness.\nFor $B = n$, assuming that all the job sizes are at least $1$, it holds that $\\OPT(x) \\geq n(n+1)/2$ and the lemma gives $\\ratio_{n,B}(\\eta;\\switch) \\leq 1 + \\frac{2 \\eta}{n}$, matching the bound proved on (SPJF) in \\cite{purohit2018improving}. On the other hand, if $\\eta = 0$, setting $\\rho = 0$ results in $\\ratio_{n,B}(0;\\switch) \\leq 2 - \\frac{B}{n}$.\n\n\\paragraph{Preferential algorithm}\nNow we need to adapt the algorithm to guarantee robustness in the face of arbitrarily erroneous predictions. We use the same approach as Lemma 3.1 of \\cite{purohit2018improving}, which consists of running concurrently a consistent algorithm and round-robin at respective rates $\\lambda$, $1-\\lambda$ for some $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$. However, their result only applies for deterministic algorithms $\\A$ satisfying for any instances $x = (x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ and $x' = (x'_1,\\ldots,x'_n)$ that\n\\[\n\\big(\\forall i \\in [n]: x_i \\leq x'_i\\big)\n\\implies \\A(x) \\leq \\A(x')\\;.\n\\]\nSuch algorithms are called \\textit{monotonic}. $\\switch$ with breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(i)} = \\xi y_{\\sigma(i)}$ is not deterministic since its objective function depends both on $\\sigma$ and $\\xi$. Nonetheless, we overcome this difficulty by proving that, conditionally to $\\sigma$ and $\\xi$, its outcome is deterministic and monotonic, then we establish the following theorem.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:preferential-algo}\nLet $\\rho \\in (0,1]$ and $F = 1 + \\mathcal{E}(1/\\rho)$. Then the preferential algorithm $\\ALG_\\lambda$ which runs Algorithm \\ref{algo:any-pred} at rate $\\lambda$ and round-robin at rate $1-\\lambda$ has an $(n,B)$-competitive ratio of at most\n\\[\n\\min\\left( \\frac{2}{1 - \\lambda} \\;,\\; \\frac{C_{\\rho,n,B}}{\\lambda} +  \\frac{S_{\\rho,n,B}}{\\lambda} \\cdot \\frac{n \\E[\\eta^\\sigma] }{\\OPT(x)}\\right)\\;,\n\\]\nwith\n\\begin{align*}\nC_{\\rho,n,B} &= \\big(2 - \\tfrac{B}{n}\\big) + \\rho \\tfrac{B}{n}\\big(1 - \\tfrac{B-1}{n-1}\\big) \\\\\nS_{\\rho,n,B} &= \\tfrac{4}{\\rho}\\big(1 - \\tfrac{B}{n}\\big) + \\tfrac{B}{n} \\;.\n\\end{align*}\n\\end{theorem}\nThis upper bound generalizes that of \\cite{purohit2018improving}. It presents a consistency-robustness tradeoff that can be tuned by adjusting the parameter $\\lambda$, and a consistency-smoothness tradeoff controlled by the parameter $\\rho$, which vanishes for $B$ close to $0$ or $n$, as the terms multiplying $\\rho$ and $1/\\rho$ respectively in $C_{\\rho,n,B}$ and $S_{\\rho,n,B}$ become zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

When $\\lambda = 0$, PA becomes round-robin. For $\\lambda=1$ and $\\rho=0.5$, PA simply runs $\\switch(\\rho=0.5)$, which gives an improved consistency ($\\tau = 0$), not equal to $1$ because $B<n$ and $\\rho > 0$, and gives a ratio that deteriorates arbitrarily as $\\tau$ increases. \nIn contrast, PA with $\\lambda = 0.5$ gives a weaker consistency but maintains bounded ratios, even with arbitrarily erroneous predictions. The choice of $\\rho = 0$ exhibits a slightly better consistency compared to $\\rho=0.5$, in line with theoretical expectations, but there is no significant difference regarding sensitivity to errors. This should not be surprising since setting $\\rho > 0$ ensures smoothness in the worst-case (see Figure \\ref{fig:consistency-smoothness}), but it is not necessarily needed for all instances.\n\nThe right plot examines the influence of $B$ on PA with parameters $\\lambda = 1$ and $\\rho=0.5$, which corresponds to\n$\\switch$ with $\\rho = 0.5$.

This shows that more predictions enhance consistency, while fewer predictions enhance robustness.\n\n\n\\paragraph{Consistency-smoothness}\nTo shed light on the tradeoff between consistency and smoothness raised in Section \\ref{sec:imperfect-pred}, we consider i.i.d. job sizes $x_1,\\ldots,x_{100}$, each taking the value 1 w.p. 1/2 and 2 w.p. 1/2, and we consider noisy predictions of the form $y_i = x_i + \\eps_i$, where $\\eps_i$ follows a uniform distribution over $[-\\tau, \\tau]$. Figure \\ref{fig:consistency-smoothness} illustrates the evolution, for $\\tau$ varying in $[0,0.15]$, of the empirical competitive ratio of $\\switch$ with parameter $\\rho \\in \\{0, 0.1, 0.5\\}$ and $B \\in \\{50,95\\}$, \n\n\nFor both values of $B$, the experiment reveals that larger values of $\\rho$ give bigger ratios when $\\tau = 0$ (less consistency), but on the other hand they yield less sensitivity to variations of the expected prediction error (better smoothness), which confirms our theoretical findings. In particular, for $\\rho = 0$, a significant discontinuity arises when $\\tau$ becomes positive. Figure \\ref{fig:consistency-smoothness} also shows that this tradeoff is less significant as $B$ approaches $n = 100$,  with the consistency values for $\\rho \\in \\{0, 0.1, 0.5\\}$ drawing closer.\n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\begin{center}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=\\columnwidth]{figs/consistencySmoothness.pdf}}\n\\caption{Tradeoff between consistency and smoothness}\n\\label{fig:consistency-smoothness}\n\\end{center}\n\\vskip -0.3in\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\n"

                "\nThis paper explores the non-clairvoyant scheduling problem with a limited number of predicted job sizes. We give near optimal lower and upper bounds in the case of perfect predictions, and we introduce a learning-augmented algorithm raising the common consistency-robustness tradeoff and an additional consistency-smoothness tradeoff, the latter vanishing when $B$ approaches $0$ or $n$.\n\nOur findings join previous works in demonstrating that online algorithms can indeed achieve improved performance even when armed with a restricted set of predictions, which is an assumption more aligned with practical scenarios. Furthermore, they affirm the necessity of studying and understanding these regimes, as they may unveil unique behaviors absent in the zero- or full-information settings.\n\n\\subsection{Open Questions}\n\n\\paragraph{Tight lower bounds} In the case of perfect predictions, there is\na (small) gap between the lower bounds of Section \\ref{sec:lowerbounds} and the competitive ratios of $\\switch$ and $\\CRRR$. An interesting research avenue is to close this gap, either by designing better algorithms or improving the lower bound. This could involve using Theorem \\ref{thm:lower-bound} with more refined distributions.\n\n\\paragraph{Reduced number of action predictions} Algorithm $\\switch$ leverages the job sizes' predictions, not only the order they induce. Using the $\\ell_1$ norm to measure the error is thus a suitable choice. However, as discussed in Section \\ref{sec:orderonly}, Algorithm $\\CRRR$ only uses the priority order in which $\\OPT$ runs $(x_{\\sigma(i)})_{i \\in [B]}$. An interesting question to explore is how to adapt it in the case of imperfect \\textit{action predictions}, using appropriate error measures.\n\n\\paragraph{Smooth and $(2-\\frac{B}{n})$-consistent algorithm}\nLemma \\ref{lem:switch-exp} and Figure \\ref{fig:consistency-smoothness} emphasize that, to achieve smoothness, $\\switch$ with parameter $\\rho$ must exhibit a consistency exceeding $2 - \\frac{B}{n}$. A compelling question arises: Is it possible to devise a smooth algorithm with a consistency of at most $2 - \\frac{B}{n}$? \n\n\n\n\n"

These algorithms leverage predictions without quality guarantees to improve performance. In practical settings, access to predictions may be limited due to cost or data constraints, necessitating the study of scenarios with partial predictions. This paper focuses on the case where predictions for only B job sizes out of n are available. The challenge lies in establishing near-optimal lower bounds and algorithms in the case of perfect predictions, and subsequently developing a learning-augmented algorithm that satisfies robustness, consistency, and smoothness criteria. This reveals a novel tradeoff between consistency and smoothness inherent in the scenario with a restricted number of predictions. The motivation stems from the limitations of existing methods, which often rely on full access to predictions or lack the flexibility to handle partial information effectively.

                "content": "Abstract: 1. Introduction The study of expected running time of algoritruns is an interesting subject from both a theoretical and a practical point of view. Basically there exist two approaches to this study. In the first approach (we shall call it the distributional approach), some \"natural\" distribution is assumed for the input of a problem, and one looks for fast algorithms under this assumption (see Knuth [8J). For example, in sorting n numbers, it is usually assumed that all n! initial orderings of the numbers are equally likely. A common criticism of this approach is that distributions vary a great deal in real life situations; fu.rthermore, very often the true distribution of the input is simply not known. An alternative approach which attempts to overcome this shortcoming by allowing stochastic moves in the computation has recently been proposed. This is the randomized approach made popular by Habin [lOJ(also see Gill[3J, Solovay and Strassen [13J), although the concept was familiar to statisticians (for exa'1lple, see Luce and Raiffa [9J). Note that by allowing stochastic moves in an algorithm, the input is effectively being randomized. We shall refer to such an algoritlvn as a randomized algorithm. These two approaches lead naturally to two different definitions of intrinsic complexity of a problem, which we term the distributional complexity and the randomized complexity, respectively. (Precise definitions and examples will be given in Sections 2 and 3.) To solidify the ideas, we look at familiar combinatorial problems that can be modeled by decision trees. In particular, we consider (a) the testing of an arbitrary graph property from an adjacency matrix (Section 2), and (b) partial order problems on n We will show that for these two classes of problems, the two complexity measures always agree by virtue of a famous theorem, the Minimax Theorem of Von Neumann [14J. The connection between the two approaches lends itself to applications. With two different views (and in a sense complementary to each other) on the complexity of a problem, it is frequently easier to derive upper and lower bounds. For example, using adjacency matrix representation for a graph, it can be shown that no randomized algorithm can determine 2 the existence of a perfect matching in less than O(n) probes. Such lower bounds to the randomized approach were lacking previously. As another example of application , we can prove that for the partial order problems in (b), assuming uniform …\n@inproceedings{yao1977probabilistic,\n  title={Probabilistic computations: Toward a unified measure of complexity},\n  author={Yao, Andrew Chi-Chin},\n  booktitle={18th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (sfcs 1977)},\n  pages={222--227},\n  year={1977},\n  organization={IEEE Computer Society}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: Preface 1.

Despite this fact, SRPT scheduling is rarely used in practice. It is believed that the performance improvements of SRPT over other scheduling policies stem from the fact that SRPT unfairly penalizes the large jobs in order to help the small jobs. This belief has led people to instead adopt \"fair\" scheduling policies such as Processor-Sharing (PS), which produces the same expected slowdown for jobs of all sizes.This paper investigates formally the problem of unfairness in SRPT scheduling as compared with PS scheduling. The analysis assumes an M/G/1 model, and emphasizes job size distributions with a heavy-tailed property, as are characteristic of empirical workloads. The analysis shows that the degree of unfairness under SRPT is surprisingly small.The M/G/1/SRPT and M/G/1/PS queues are also analyzed under overload and closed-form expressions for mean response time as a function of job size are proved in this setting.\n@inproceedings{bansal2001analysis,\n  title={Analysis of SRPT scheduling: Investigating unfairness},\n  author={Bansal, Nikhil and Harchol-Balter, Mor},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2001 ACM SIGMETRICS International conference on Measurement and modeling of computer systems},\n  pages={279--290},\n  year={2001}\n}\n\nAbstract: We measure the distribution of lifetimes for UNIX processes and propose a functional form that fits this distribution well. We use this functional form to derive a policy for preemptive migration, and then use a trace-driven simulator to compare our proposed policy with other preemptive migration policies, and with a non-preemptive load balancing strategy. We find that, contrary to previous reports, the performance benefits of preemptive migration are significantly greater than those of non-preemptive migration, even when the memory-transfer cost is high. Using a model of migration costs representative of current systems, we find that preemptive migration reduces the mean delay (queueing and migration) by 35 - 50%, compared to non-preemptive migration.\n@article{harchol1997exploiting,\n  title={Exploiting process lifetime distributions for dynamic load balancing},\n  author={Harchol-Balter, Mor and Downey, Allen B},\n  journal={ACM Transactions on Computer Systems (TOCS)},\n  volume={15},\n  number={3},\n  pages={253--285},\n  year={1997},\n  publisher={ACM New York, NY, USA}\n}\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n% Scheduling\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n% Optimal job scheduling\n@incollection{graham1979optimization,\n  title={Optimization and approximation in deterministic sequencing and scheduling: a survey},\n  author={Graham, Ronald Lewis and Lawler, Eugene Leighton and Lenstra, Jan Karel and Kan, AHG Rinnooy},\n  booktitle={Annals of discrete mathematics},\n  volume={5},\n  pages={287--326},\n  year={1979},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\nAbstract: • A submitted manuscript is the version of the article upon submission and before peer-review.

We consider a variety of scheduling, batching, and delivery problems that arise in an arborescent supply chain where a supplier makes deliveries to several manufacturers, who also make deliveries to customers. The objective is to minimize the overall scheduling and delivery cost, using several classical scheduling objectives. This is achieved by scheduling the jobs and forming them into batches, each of which is delivered to the next downstream stage as a single shipment. For each problem, we either derive an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that minimizes the total cost of the supplier or that of the manufacturer, or we demonstrate that this problem is intractable. The total system cost minimization problem of a supplier and manufacturer who make cooperative decisions is also considered. We demonstrate that cooperation between a supplier and a manufacturer may reduce the total system cost by at least 20%, or 25%, or by up to 100%, depending upon the scheduling objective. Finally, we identify incentives and mechanisms for this cooperation, thereby demonstrating that our work has practical implications for improving the efficiency of supply chains.\n@article{hall2003supply,\n  title={Supply chain scheduling: Batching and delivery},\n  author={Hall, Nicholas G and Potts, Chris N},\n  journal={Operations Research},\n  volume={51},\n  number={4},\n  pages={566--584},\n  year={2003},\n  publisher={INFORMS}\n}\nAbstract: Smart factories Industry 4.0 on the basis of collaborative cyber-physical systems represents a future form of industrial networks. Supply chains in such networks have dynamic structures which evolve over time. In these settings, short-term supply chain scheduling in smart factories Industry 4.0 is challenged by temporal machine structures, different processing speed at parallel machines and dynamic job arrivals. In this study, for the first time, a dynamic model and algorithm for short-term supply chain scheduling in smart factories Industry 4.0 is presented. The peculiarity of the considered problem is the simultaneous consideration of both machine structure selection and job assignments. The scheduling approach is based on a dynamic non-stationary interpretation of the execution of the jobs and a temporal decomposition of the scheduling problem. The algorithmic realisation is based on a modified form of the continuous maximum principle blended with mathematical optimisation. A detailed theoretical analysis of the temporal decomposition and computational complexity is performed. The optimality conditions as well as the structural properties of the model and the algorithm are investigated. Advantages and limitations of the proposed approach are discussed.\n@article{ivanov2016dynamic,\n  title={A dynamic model and an algorithm for short-term supply chain scheduling in the smart factory industry 4.0},\n  author={Ivanov, Dmitry and Dolgui, Alexandre and Sokolov, Boris and Werner, Frank and Ivanova, Marina},\n  journal={International Journal of Production Research},\n  volume={54},\n  number={2},\n  pages={386--402},\n  year={2016},\n  publisher={Taylor \\& Francis}\n}\n\n\n\n\n% Applications in operating systems\nAbstract: This paper summarizes the state of the real-time field in the areas of scheduling and operating system kernels. Given the vast amount of work that has been done by both the operations research and computer science communities in the scheduling area, we discuss four paradigms underlying the scheduling approaches and present several exemplars of each. The four paradigms are: static table-driven scheduling, static priority preemptive scheduling, dynamic planning-based scheduling, and dynamic best effort scheduling. In the operating system context, we argue that most of the proprietary commercial kernels as well as real-time extensions to time-sharing operating system kernels do not fit the needs of predictable realtime systems. We discuss several research kernels that are currently being built to explicitly meet the needs of real-time applications. >\n@article{ramamritham1994scheduling,\n  title={Scheduling algorithms and operating systems support for real-time systems},\n  author={Ramamritham, Krithi and Stankovic, John A},\n  journal={Proceedings of the IEEE},\n  volume={82},\n  number={1},\n  pages={55--67},\n  year={1994},\n  publisher={IEEE}\n}\n@inproceedings{jensen1985time,\n  title={A time-driven scheduling model for real-time operating systems.},\n  author={Jensen, E Douglas and Locke, C Douglass and Tokuda, Hideyuki},\n  booktitle={Rtss},\n  volume={85},\n  pages={112--122},\n  year={1985}\n}\nAbstract: Today's reconfigurable hardware devices have huge densities and are partially reconfigurable, allowing for the configuration and execution of hardware tasks in a true multitasking manner. This makes reconfigurable platforms an ideal target for many modern embedded systems that combine high computation demands with dynamic task sets. A rather new line of research is engaged in the construction of operating systems for reconfigurable embedded platforms. Such an operating system provides a minimal programming model and a runtime system. The runtime system performs online task and resource management. In this paper, we first discuss design issues for reconfigurable hardware operating systems. Then, we focus on a runtime system for guarantee-based scheduling of hard real-time tasks. We formulate the scheduling problem for the 1D and 2D resource models and present two heuristics, the horizon and the stuffing technique, to tackle it. Simulation experiments conducted with synthetic workloads evaluate the performance and the runtime efficiency of the proposed schedulers. The scheduling performance for the 1D resource model is strongly dependent on the aspect ratios of the tasks. Compared to the 1D model, the 2D resource model is clearly superior. Finally, the runtime overhead of the scheduling algorithms is shown to be acceptably low.\n@article{steiger2004operating,\n  title={Operating systems for reconfigurable embedded platforms: Online scheduling of real-time tasks},\n  author={Steiger, Christoph and Walder, Herbert and Platzner, Marco},\n  journal={IEEE Transactions on computers},\n  volume={53},\n  number={11},\n  pages={1393--1407},\n  year={2004},\n  publisher={IEEE}\n}\n\n\n% Single machine scheduling\nAbstract: An up-to-date and comprehensive treatment of the fundamentals of scheduling theory, including recent advances and state-of-the-art topics Principles of Sequencing and Scheduling strikes a unique balance between theory and practice, providing an accessible introduction to the concepts, methods, and results of scheduling theory and its core topics.

In this work, we study classic scheduling problems under the learning augmented setting. More specifically, we consider the problem of scheduling jobs with arbitrary release dates on a single machine and the problem of scheduling jobs with a common release date on multiple machines. Our objective is to minimize the sum of completion times. For both problems, we propose algorithms which use predictions for taking their decisions. Our algorithms are consistent -- i.e. when the predictions are accurate, the performances of our algorithms are close to those of an optimal offline algorithm--, and robust -- i.e. when the predictions are wrong, the performance of our algorithms are close to those of an online algorithm without predictions. In addition, we confirm the above theoretical bounds by conducting experimental evaluation comparing the proposed algorithms to the offline optimal ones for both the single and multiple machines settings.\n@inproceedings{bampis2022scheduling,\n  title={Scheduling with untrusted predictions},\n  author={Bampis, Evripidis and Dogeas, Konstantinos and Kononov, Alexander V and Lucarelli, Giorgio and Pascual, Fanny},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the Thirty-First International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, IJCAI},\n  pages={4581--4587},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: In the single-machine non-clairvoyant scheduling problem, the goal is to minimize the total completion time of jobs whose processing times are unknown a priori.

We revisit this well-studied problem in a recently popular learning-augmented setting that integrates (untrusted) predictions in online algorithm design. While previous works used predictions on processing requirements, we propose a new prediction model, which provides a relative order of jobs which could be seen as predicting algorithmic actions rather than parts of the unknown input. We show that these predictions have desired properties, admit a natural error measure as well as algorithms with strong performance guarantees and that they are learnable in both, theory and practice. We generalize the algorithmic framework proposed in the seminal paper by Kumar et al. (NeurIPS'18) and present the first learning-augmented scheduling results for weighted jobs and unrelated machines. We demonstrate in empirical experiments the practicability and superior performance compared to the previously suggested single-machine algorithms.\n@inproceedings{lindermayr2022permutation,\n  title={Permutation predictions for non-clairvoyant scheduling},\n  author={Lindermayr, Alexander and Megow, Nicole},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 34th ACM Symposium on Parallelism in Algorithms and Architectures},\n  pages={357--368},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\nAbstract: We study single-machine scheduling of jobs, each belonging to a job type that determines its duration distribution. We start by analyzing the scenario where the type characteristics are known and then move to two learning scenarios where the types are unknown: non-preemptive problems, where each started job must be completed before moving to another job; and preemptive problems, where job execution can be paused in the favor of moving to a different job. In both cases, we design algorithms that achieve sublinear excess cost, compared to the performance with known types, and prove lower bounds for the non-preemptive case. Notably, we demonstrate, both theoretically and through simulations, how preemptive algorithms can greatly outperform non-preemptive ones when the durations of different job types are far from one another, a phenomenon that does not occur when the type durations are known.\n@inproceedings{merlis2023preemption,\n  title={On preemption and learning in stochastic scheduling},\n  author={Merlis, Nadav and Richard, Hugo and Sentenac, Flore and Odic, Corentin and Molina, Mathieu and Perchet, Vianney},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},\n  pages={24478--24516},\n  year={2023},\n  organization={PMLR}\n}\n\n\n\nAbstract: As power management has become a primary concern in modern data centers, computing resources are being scaled dynamically to minimize energy consumption. We initiate the study of a variant of the classic online speed scaling problem, in which machine learning predictions about the future can be integrated naturally. Inspired by recent work on learning-augmented online algorithms, we propose an algorithm which incorporates predictions in a black-box manner and outperforms any online algorithm if the accuracy is high, yet maintains provable guarantees if the prediction is very inaccurate. We provide both theoretical and experimental evidence to support our claims.\n@article{bamas2020learning,\n  title={Learning augmented energy minimization via speed scaling},\n  author={Bamas, {\\'E}tienne and Maggiori, Andreas and Rohwedder, Lars and Svensson, Ola},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={33},\n  pages={15350--15359},\n  year={2020}\n}\n\n\nAbstract: The research area of algorithms with predictions has seen recent success showing how to incorporate machine learning into algorithm design to improve performance when the predictions are correct, while retaining worst-case guarantees when they are not. Most previous work has assumed that the algorithm has access to a single predictor. However, in practice, there are many machine learning methods available, often with incomparable generalization guarantees, making it hard to pick a best method a priori. In this work we consider scenarios where multiple predictors are available to the algorithm and the question is how to best utilize them. Ideally, we would like the algorithm's performance to depend on the quality of the best predictor. However, utilizing more predictions comes with a cost, since we now have to identify which prediction is the best. We study the use of multiple predictors for a number of fundamental problems, including matching, load balancing, and non-clairvoyant scheduling, which have been well-studied in the single predictor setting. For each of these problems we introduce new algorithms that take advantage of multiple predictors, and prove bounds on the resulting performance.\n@article{dinitz2022algorithms,\n  title={Algorithms with prediction portfolios},\n  author={Dinitz, Michael and Im, Sungjin and Lavastida, Thomas and Moseley, Benjamin and Vassilvitskii, Sergei},\n  journal={Advances in neural information processing systems},\n  volume={35},\n  pages={20273--20286},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\n\n% Various objective functions\nAbstract: We consider the problem of online scheduling on a single machine in order to minimize weighted flow time. The existing algorithms for this problem (STOC ’01, SODA ’03, FOCS ’18) all require exact knowledge of the processing time of each job. This assumption is crucial, as even a slight perturbation of the processing time would lead to polynomial competitive ratio. However, this assumption very rarely holds in real-life scenarios. In this paper, we present the first algorithm for weighted flow time which do not require exact knowledge of the processing times of jobs. Specifically, we introduce the Scheduling with Predicted Processing Time (SPPT) problem, where the algorithm is given a prediction for the processing time of each job, instead of its real processing time. For the case of a constant factor distortion between the predictions and the real processing time, our algorithms match all the best known competitiveness bounds for weighted flow time – namely O(logP), O(logD) and O(logW), where P,D,W are the maximum ratios of processing times, densities, and weights, respectively. For larger errors, the competitiveness of our algorithms degrades gracefully.\n@inproceedings{azar2021flow,\n  title={Flow time scheduling with uncertain processing time},\n  author={Azar, Yossi and Leonardi, Stefano and Touitou, Noam},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 53rd Annual ACM SIGACT Symposium on Theory of Computing},\n  pages={1070--1080},\n  year={2021}\n}\n% purohit2018improving\nAbstract: Online algorithms are a hallmark of worst case optimization under uncertainty. On the other hand, in practice, the input is often far from worst case, and has some predictable characteristics. A recent line of work has shown how to use machine learned predictions to circumvent strong lower bounds on competitive ratios in classic online problems such as ski rental and caching. We study how predictive techniques can be used to break through worst case barriers in online scheduling. The makespan minimization problem with restricted assignments is a classic problem in online scheduling theory. Worst case analysis of this problem gives Ω(log m ) lower bounds on the competitive ratio in the online setting. We identify a robust quantity that can be predicted and then used to guide online algorithms to achieve better performance. Our predictions are compact in size, having dimension linear in the number of machines, and can be learned using standard oﬀ the shelf methods. The performance guarantees of our algorithms depend on the accuracy of the predictions, given predictions with error η , we show how to construct O (log η ) competitive fractional assignments. We then give an online algorithm that rounds any fractional assignment into an integral schedule. Our algorithm is O ((log log m ) 3 )-competitive and we give a nearly matching ˜Ω(log log m ) lower bound for online rounding algorithms. 1 Altogether, we give algorithms that, equipped with predictions with error η , achieve O (log η (log log m ) 3 ) competitive ratios, breaking the Ω(log m ) lower bound even for moderately accurate predictions.\n@inproceedings{lattanzi2020online,\n  title={Online scheduling via learned weights},\n  author={Lattanzi, Silvio and Lavastida, Thomas and Moseley, Benjamin and Vassilvitskii, Sergei},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the Fourteenth Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms},\n  pages={1859--1877},\n  year={2020},\n  organization={SIAM}\n}\n\n% Various prediction types and error metrics\nAbstract: Given the rapid rise in energy demand by data centers and computing systems in general, it is fundamental to incorporate energy considerations when designing (scheduling) algorithms. Machine learning can be a useful approach in practice by predicting the future load of the system based on, for example, historical data. However, the effectiveness of such an approach highly depends on the quality of the predictions and can be quite far from optimal when predictions are sub-par. On the other hand, while providing a worst-case guarantee, classical online algorithms can be pessimistic for large classes of inputs arising in practice. This paper, in the spirit of the new area of machine learning augmented algorithms, attempts to obtain the best of both worlds for the classical, deadline based, online speed-scaling problem: Based on the introduction of a novel prediction setup, we develop algorithms that (i) obtain provably low energy-consumption in the presence of adequate predictions, and (ii) are robust against inadequate predictions, and (iii) are smooth, i.e., their performance gradually degrades as the prediction error increases.\n@article{antoniadis2021novel,\n  title={A novel prediction setup for online speed-scaling},\n  author={Antoniadis, Antonios and Ganje, Peyman Jabbarzade and Shahkarami, Golnoosh},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2112.03082},\n  year={2021}\n}\nAbstract: We consider non-clairvoyant scheduling with online precedence constraints, where an algorithm is oblivious to any job dependencies and learns about a job only if all of its predecessors have been completed. Given strong impossibility results in classical competitive analysis, we investigate the problem in a learning-augmented setting, where an algorithm has access to predictions without any quality guarantee. We discuss different prediction models: novel problem-specific models as well as general ones, which have been proposed in previous works. We present lower bounds and algorithmic upper bounds for different precedence topologies, and thereby give a structured overview on which and how additional (possibly erroneous) information helps for designing better algorithms. Along the way, we also improve bounds on traditional competitive ratios for existing algorithms.\n@inproceedings{lassota2023minimalistic,\n  title={Minimalistic predictions to schedule jobs with online precedence constraints},\n  author={Lassota, Alexandra Anna and Lindermayr, Alexander and Megow, Nicole and Schl{\\\"o}ter, Jens},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},\n  pages={18563--18583},\n  year={2023},\n  organization={PMLR}\n}\n\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%% Learning-augmented algorithms\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n% Basics\nAbstract: Indexes are models: a \\btree-Index can be seen as a model to map a key to the position of a record within a sorted array, a Hash-Index as a model to map a key to a position of a record within an unsorted array, and a BitMap-Index as a model to indicate if a data record exists or not. In this exploratory research paper, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models, including deep-learning models, which we term \\em learned indexes. We theoretically analyze under which conditions learned indexes outperform traditional index structures and describe the main challenges in designing learned index structures. Our initial results show that our learned indexes can have significant advantages over traditional indexes. More importantly, we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a data management system through learned models has far reaching implications for future systems designs and that this work provides just a glimpse of what might be possible.\n@inproceedings{kraska2018case,\n  title={The case for learned index structures},\n  author={Kraska, Tim and Beutel, Alex and Chi, Ed H and Dean, Jeffrey and Polyzotis, Neoklis},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 2018 international conference on management of data},\n  pages={489--504},\n  year={2018}\n}\n\nAbstract: In the context of advertising auctions, finding good reserve prices is a notoriously challenging learning problem.

We further bound the gap between the expected bid and revenue in terms of the average loss of the predictor.

On the other hand, machine learning algorithms are in the business of extrapolating patterns found in the data to predict the future, and usually come with strong guarantees on the expected generalization error.\n In this work, we develop a framework for augmenting online algorithms with a machine learned predictor to achieve competitive ratios that provably improve upon unconditional worst-case lower bounds when the predictor has low error. Our approach treats the predictor as a complete black box and is not dependent on its inner workings or the exact distribution of its errors.\n \n We apply this framework to the traditional caching problem—creating an eviction strategy for a cache of size\n k\n . We demonstrate that naively following the oracle’s recommendations may lead to very poor performance, even when the average error is quite low. Instead, we show how to modify the Marker algorithm to take into account the predictions and prove that this combined approach achieves a competitive ratio that both (i) decreases as the predictor’s error decreases and (ii) is always capped by\n O\n (log\n k\n ), which can be achieved without any assistance from the predictor.

However, classic treaps do not take advantage of the input distribution or patterns in the input. Given recent advances in algorithms with predictions, we propose pairing treaps with machine advice to form a learning-augmented treap. We are the first to propose a learning-augmented data structure that supports binary search tree operations such as range-query and successor functionalities. With the assumption that we have access to advice from a frequency estimation oracle, we assign learned priorities to the nodes to better improve the treap’s structure. We theoretically analyze the learning-augmented treap’s performance under various input distributions and show that under those circumstances, our learning-augmented treap has stronger guarantees than classic treaps and other classic tree-based data structures. Fur-ther, we experimentally evaluate our learned treap on synthetic datasets and demonstrate a performance advantage over other search tree data structures.

We focus on the classical online problems of ski-rental and prophet-inequalities, and provide sample complexity bounds for the underlying learning tasks. First, we point out that for general distributions it is information-theoretically impossible to beat the worst-case competitive-ratio with any ﬁnite sample size. As our main contribution, we establish strong positive results for well-behaved distributions. Speciﬁcally, for the broad class of log-concave distributions, we show that poly(1 /(cid:15) ) samples sufﬁce to obtain (1 + (cid:15) ) - competitive ratio.

We compare our algorithms to the cost of the true and predicted offline optimal solutions and show that these algorithms outperform any online algorithm when the prediction is accurate while maintaining good guarantees when the prediction is misleading.\n@article{bamas2020primal,\n  title={The primal-dual method for learning augmented algorithms},\n  author={Bamas, Etienne and Maggiori, Andreas and Svensson, Ola},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={33},\n  pages={20083--20094},\n  year={2020}\n}\nAbstract: We study the online problem of minimizing power consumption in systems with multiple power-saving states. During idle periods of unknown lengths, an algorithm has to choose between power-saving states of different energy consumption and wake-up costs. We develop a learning-augmented online algorithm that makes decisions based on (potentially inaccurate) predicted lengths of the idle periods. The algorithm's performance is near-optimal when predictions are accurate and degrades gracefully with increasing prediction error, with a worst-case guarantee almost identical to the optimal classical online algorithm for the problem. A key ingredient in our approach is a new algorithm for the online ski rental problem in the learning augmented setting with tight dependence on the prediction error. We support our theoretical findings with experiments.\n@article{antoniadis2021learning,\n  title={Learning-augmented dynamic power management with multiple states via new ski rental bounds},\n  author={Antoniadis, Antonios and Coester, Christian and Eli{\\'a}s, Marek and Polak, Adam and Simon, Bertrand},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={34},\n  pages={16714--16726},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n% Secretary\n%%%%%%%%%%%%\n@article{antoniadis2020secretary,\n  title={Secretary and online matching problems with machine learned advice},\n  author={Antoniadis, Antonios and Gouleakis, Themis and Kleer, Pieter and Kolev, Pavel},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={33},\n  pages={7933--7944},\n  year={2020}\n}\nAbstract: The secretary problem is probably the purest model of decision making under uncertainty. In this paper we ask which advice can we give the algorithm to improve its success probability? We propose a general model that unifies a broad range of problems: from the classic secretary problem with no advice, to the variant where the quality of a secretary is drawn from a known distribution and the algorithm learns each candidate's quality on arrival, to more modern versions of advice in the form of samples, to an ML-inspired model where a classifier gives us noisy signal about whether or not the current secretary is the best on the market. Our main technique is a factor revealing LP that captures all of the problems above. We use this LP formulation to gain structural insight into the optimal policy. Using tools from linear programming, we present a tight analysis of optimal algorithms for secretaries with samples, optimal algorithms when secretaries' qualities are drawn from a known distribution, and a new noisy binary advice model.\n@inproceedings{dutting2021secretaries,\n  title={Secretaries with advice},\n  author={D{\\\"u}tting, Paul and Lattanzi, Silvio and Paes Leme, Renato and Vassilvitskii, Sergei},\n  booktitle={Proceedings of the 22nd ACM Conference on Economics and Computation},\n  pages={409--429},\n  year={2021}\n}\n\n\n% Matching\n%%%%%%%%%%\nAbstract: A recent line of research investigates how algorithms can be augmented with machine-learned predictions to overcome worst case lower bounds. This area has revealed interesting algorithmic insights into problems, with particular success in the design of competitive online algorithms. However, the question of improving algorithm running times with predictions has largely been unexplored. We take a first step in this direction by combining the idea of machine-learned predictions with the idea of\"warm-starting\"primal-dual algorithms. We consider one of the most important primitives in combinatorial optimization: weighted bipartite matching and its generalization to $b$-matching. We identify three key challenges when using learned dual variables in a primal-dual algorithm. First, predicted duals may be infeasible, so we give an algorithm that efficiently maps predicted infeasible duals to nearby feasible solutions. Second, once the duals are feasible, they may not be optimal, so we show that they can be used to quickly find an optimal solution. Finally, such predictions are useful only if they can be learned, so we show that the problem of learning duals for matching has low sample complexity. We validate our theoretical findings through experiments on both real and synthetic data. As a result we give a rigorous, practical, and empirically effective method to compute bipartite matchings.\n@article{dinitz2021faster,\n  title={Faster matchings via learned duals},\n  author={Dinitz, Michael and Im, Sungjin and Lavastida, Thomas and Moseley, Benjamin and Vassilvitskii, Sergei},\n  journal={Advances in neural information processing systems},\n  volume={34},\n  pages={10393--10406},\n  year={2021}\n}\nAbstract: We consider the question of speeding up classic graph algorithms with machine-learned predictions.

Dinitz, Im, Lavastida, Moseley, and Vassilvitskii~(2021) have demonstrated that a warm start with learned dual solutions can improve the time complexity of the Hungarian method for weighted perfect bipartite matching. We extend and improve their framework in a principled manner via \\textit{discrete convex analysis} (DCA), a discrete analog of convex analysis. We show the usefulness of our DCA-based framework by applying it to weighted perfect bipartite matching, weighted matroid intersection, and discrete energy minimization for computer vision. Our DCA-based framework yields time complexity bounds that depend on the $\\ell_\\infty$-distance from a predicted solution to an optimal solution, which has two advantages relative to the previous $\\ell_1$-distance-dependent bounds: time complexity bounds are smaller, and learning of predictions is more sample efficient. We also discuss whether to learn primal or dual solutions from the DCA perspective.\n@article{sakaue2022discrete,\n  title={Discrete-convex-analysis-based framework for warm-starting algorithms with predictions},\n  author={Sakaue, Shinsaku and Oki, Taihei},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={35},\n  pages={20988--21000},\n  year={2022}\n}\nAbstract: We study the two-stage vertex-weighted online bipartite matching problem of Feng, Niazadeh, and Saberi (SODA 2021) in a setting where the algorithm has access to a suggested matching that is recommended in the first stage.

We characterize for this problem the Pareto-efficient frontier between robustness and consistency, which is rare in the literature on advice-augmented algorithms, yet necessary for quantifying such an algorithm to be optimal. Specifically, we propose an algorithm that is $R$-robust and $C$-consistent for any $(R,C)$ with $0 \\leq R \\leq \\frac{3}{4}$ and $\\sqrt{1-R} + \\sqrt{1-C} = 1$, and prove that no other algorithm can achieve a better tradeoff.\n@article{jin2022online,\n  title={Online bipartite matching with advice: Tight robustness-consistency tradeoffs for the two-stage model},\n  author={Jin, Billy and Ma, Will},\n  journal={Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  volume={35},\n  pages={14555--14567},\n  year={2022}\n}\n\n\n\n% MTS\n%%%%%\n% lykouris2018competitive\nAbstract: Machine-learned predictors, although achieving very good results for inputs resembling training data, cannot possibly provide perfect predictions in all situations. Still, decision-making systems that are based on such predictors need not only benefit from good predictions, but should also achieve a decent performance when the predictions are inadequate. In this article, we propose a prediction setup for arbitrary metrical task systems (MTS) (e.g., caching, k-server, and convex body chasing) and online matching on the line. We utilize results from the theory of online algorithms to show how to make the setup robust. Specifically, for caching, we present an algorithm whose performance, as a function of the prediction error, is exponentially better than what is achievable for general MTS. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation of our methods on real-world datasets, which suggests practicality.\n@article{antoniadis2023online,\n  title={Online metric algorithms with untrusted predictions},\n  author={Antoniadis, Antonios and Coester, Christian and Eli{\\'a}{\\v{s}}, Marek and Polak, Adam and Simon, Bertrand},\n  journal={ACM Transactions on Algorithms},\n  volume={19},\n  number={2},\n  pages={1--34},\n  year={2023},\n  publisher={ACM New York, NY}\n}\n\nAbstract: Paging is a prototypical problem in the area of online algorithms. It has also played a central role in the development of learning-augmented algorithms -- a recent line of research that aims to ameliorate the shortcomings of classical worst-case analysis by giving algorithms access to predictions. Such predictions can typically be generated using a machine learning approach, but they are inherently imperfect. Previous work on learning-augmented paging has investigated predictions on (i) when the current page will be requested again (reoccurrence predictions), (ii) the current state of the cache in an optimal algorithm (state predictions), (iii) all requests until the current page gets requested again, and (iv) the relative order in which pages are requested. We study learning-augmented paging from the new perspective of requiring the least possible amount of predicted information. More specifically, the predictions obtained alongside each page request are limited to one bit only. We consider two natural such setups: (i) discard predictions, in which the predicted bit denotes whether or not it is ``safe'' to evict this page, and (ii) phase predictions, where the bit denotes whether the current page will be requested in the next phase (for an appropriate partitioning of the input into phases). We develop algorithms for each of the two setups that satisfy all three desirable properties of learning-augmented algorithms -- that is, they are consistent, robust and smooth -- despite being limited to a one-bit prediction per request. We also present lower bounds establishing that our algorithms are essentially best possible.\n@inproceedings{antoniadis2023paging,\n  title={Paging with succinct predictions},\n  author={Antoniadis, Antonios and Boyar, Joan and Eli{\\'a}s, Marek and Favrholdt, Lene Monrad and Hoeksma, Ruben and Larsen, Kim S and Polak, Adam and Simon, Bertrand},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},\n  pages={952--968},\n  year={2023},\n  organization={PMLR}\n}\n\n\n\nAbstract: Effective caching is crucial for the performance of modern-day computing systems. A key optimization problem arising in caching -- which item to evict to make room for a new item -- cannot be optimally solved without knowing the future. There are many classical approximation algorithms for this problem, but more recently researchers started to successfully apply machine learning to decide what to evict by discovering implicit input patterns and predicting the future. While machine learning typically does not provide any worst-case guarantees, the new field of learning-augmented algorithms proposes solutions that leverage classical online caching algorithms to make the machine-learned predictors robust. We are the first to comprehensively evaluate these learning-augmented algorithms on real-world caching datasets and state-of-the-art machine-learned predictors. We show that a straightforward method -- blindly following either a predictor or a classical robust algorithm, and switching whenever one becomes worse than the other -- has only a low overhead over a well-performing predictor, while competing with classical methods when the coupled predictor fails, thus providing a cheap worst-case insurance.\n@inproceedings{chlkedowski2021robust,\n  title={Robust learning-augmented caching: An experimental study},\n  author={Ch{l}{k{e}}dowski, Jakub and Polak, Adam and Szabucki, Bartosz and {.Z}o{l}na, Konrad Tomasz},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},\n  pages={1920--1930},\n  year={2021},\n  organization={PMLR}\n}\n\n\n\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%% Limited predictions\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n@inproceedings{benomar2023advice,\n  title={Advice Querying under Budget Constraint for Online Algorithms},\n  author={Benomar, Ziyad and Perchet, Vianney},\n  booktitle={Thirty-seventh Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems},\n  year={2023}\n}\n\nAbstract: Learning-augmented algorithms -- in which, traditional algorithms are augmented with machine-learned predictions -- have emerged as a framework to go beyond worst-case analysis. The overarching goal is to design algorithms that perform near-optimally when the predictions are accurate yet retain certain worst-case guarantees irrespective of the accuracy of the predictions. This framework has been successfully applied to online problems such as caching where the predictions can be used to alleviate uncertainties. In this paper we introduce and study the setting in which the learning-augmented algorithm can utilize the predictions parsimoniously. We consider the caching problem -- which has been extensively studied in the learning-augmented setting -- and show that one can achieve quantitatively similar results but only using a sublinear number of predictions.\n@inproceedings{im2022parsimonious,\n  title={Parsimonious learning-augmented caching},\n  author={Im, Sungjin and Kumar, Ravi and Petety, Aditya and Purohit, Manish},\n  booktitle={International Conference on Machine Learning},\n  pages={9588--9601},\n  year={2022},\n  organization={PMLR}\n}\n\nAbstract: We consider the online linear optimization problem, where at every step the algorithm plays a point $x_t$ in the unit ball, and suffers loss $\\langle c_t, x_t\\rangle$ for some cost vector $c_t$ that is then revealed to the algorithm. Recent work showed that if an algorithm receives a hint $h_t$ that has non-trivial correlation with $c_t$ before it plays $x_t$, then it can achieve a regret guarantee of $O(\\log T)$, improving on the bound of $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T})$ in the standard setting. In this work, we study the question of whether an algorithm really requires a hint at every time step. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that an algorithm can obtain $O(\\log T)$ regret with just $O(\\sqrt{T})$ hints under a natural query model; in contrast, we also show that $o(\\sqrt{T})$ hints cannot guarantee better than $\\Omega(\\sqrt{T})$ regret.

However, work in this area often makes the underlying assumption that predictions come for free (e.g., without any computational or monetary costs). In this paper, we consider a cost associated with making predictions. We show that interesting algorithmic subtleties arise for even the most basic online problems, such as ski rental and its generalization, the Bahncard problem. In particular, we show that with costly predictions, care needs to be taken in (i) asking for the prediction at the right time, (ii) deciding if it is worth asking for the prediction, and (iii) how many predictions we ask for, in settings where it is natural to consider making multiple predictions. Specifically, (i) in the basic ski-rental setting, we compute the optimal delay before asking the predictor, (ii) in the same setting, given apriori information about the true number of ski-days through its mean and variance, we provide a simple algorithm that is near-optimal, under some natural parameter settings, in deciding if it is worth asking for the predictor and (iii) in the setting of the Bahncard problem, we provide a (1 + ε ) -approximation al-gorithm and quantify lower bounds on the number of queries required to do so.

For both settings, we design new and simple algorithms using only $O(\\sum_i \\log \\eta_i)$ exact comparisons, where $\\eta_i$ is a suitably defined prediction error for the $i$th element. In particular, as the quality of predictions deteriorates, the number of comparisons degrades smoothly from $O(n)$ to $O(n\\log n)$. We prove that the comparison complexity is theoretically optimal with respect to the examined error measures.

Thus, weaker models which give imprecise results quickly can be advantageous, provided inaccuracies can be resolved using few queries to a stronger model. In the fundamental problem of computing a maximum-weight basis of a matroid, a well-known generalization of many combinatorial optimization problems, algorithms have access to a clean oracle to query matroid information. We additionally equip algorithms with a fast but dirty oracle modelling an unknown, potentially different matroid. We design and analyze practical algorithms which only use few clean queries w.r.t. the quality of the dirty oracle, while maintaining robustness against arbitrarily poor dirty matroids, approaching the performance of classic algorithms for the given problem. Notably, we prove that our algorithms are, in many respects, best-possible.

This model captures the increasingly common trade-off between employing both an expensive similarity model (e.g. a large-scale embedding model), and a less accurate but cheaper model. Hence, the goal is to make as few queries to the strong oracle as possible. We consider both so-called ''point queries'', where the strong oracle is queried on a set of points $S \\subset \\mathcal{X} $ and returns $d(x,y)$ for all $x,y \\in S$, and ''edge queries'' where it is queried for individual distances $d(x,y)$. Our main contributions are optimal algorithms and lower bounds for clustering and Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) in this model. For $k$-centers, $k$-median, and $k$-means, we give constant factor approximation algorithms with only $\\tilde{O}(k)$ strong oracle point queries, and prove that $\\Omega(k)$ queries are required for any bounded approximation.

These algorithms leverage predictions without quality guarantees to improve performance. In practical settings, access to predictions may be limited due to cost or data constraints, necessitating the study of scenarios with partial predictions. This paper focuses on the case where predictions for only B job sizes out of n are available. The challenge lies in establishing near-optimal lower bounds and algorithms in the case of perfect predictions, and subsequently developing a learning-augmented algorithm that satisfies robustness, consistency, and smoothness criteria. This reveals a novel tradeoff between consistency and smoothness inherent in the scenario with a restricted number of predictions. The motivation stems from the limitations of existing methods, which often rely on full access to predictions or lack the flexibility to handle partial information effectively. The significance of this research lies in its potential to enhance the efficiency and practicality of scheduling algorithms in real-world applications, where complete information is rarely available.\n\n## Main Idea\n\nThe paper presents a comprehensive analysis of non-clairvoyant scheduling with partial predictions.

An algorithm is called \\textit{clairvoyant} if it has initial access to the job sizes, otherwise, it is called \\textit{non-clairvoyant} \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}.\nThe design of non-clairvoyant scheduling algorithms is a classical problem in competitive analysis and online algorithms \\cite{borodin2005online}. In this paradigm, decisions must be made in an environment where the parameters governing the outcome are unknown or might evolve over time. \nDue to the inherent difficulty of the problems in competitive analysis, the performance of any online algorithm stays bounded away from that of the optimal offline algorithm. However, the ascent of machine learning motivated the incorporation of predictions in algorithm design, which started in works such as \\cite{munoz2017revenue, kraska2018case}, then was formalized in \\cite{lykouris2018competitive} and \\cite{purohit2018improving}. Since then, \\textit{learning-augmented algorithms} became a popular research topic and had multiple applications \\cite{mitzenmacher2022algorithms}.\nThe outcome of these algorithms depends both on the parameters of the problem and the quality of the predictions. They are required to have a performance that is near-optimal when the predictions are accurate (consistency), near the worst-case performance without advice if the predictions are arbitrarily erroneous (robustness), and that degrades smoothly as the prediction error increases (smoothness).\nIn practice, predictions often incur costs and, at times, are infeasible due to the lack of data. It is, therefore, crucial to understand the limitations and the feasible improvements with a restrained number of predictions in scenarios with multiple unknown variables. This question was first investigated for the caching problem \\cite{im2022parsimonious}, and very recently for metrical task systems \\cite{sadek2024algorithms}, in settings where the algorithm is allowed to query a limited number of predictions. It was also explored for the scheduling problem \\cite{benomar2023advice}, assuming that the decision-maker can query the true sizes of $B$ jobs out of $n$. The authors present a $\\big(2-\\tfrac{B(B-1)}{n(n-1)}\\big)$-competitive algorithm, and they give a lower bound on the competitive ratio of any algorithm only when $B = o(n)$. The case of imperfect predictions, however, is not examined. \nIn non-clairvoyant scheduling, besides the querying model studied in the works mentioned above, predictions of the sizes of certain jobs $i \\in I$ may be available, where $I \\subset [n]$, perhaps derived from previous executions of similar tasks. %Importantly, $I$ is a random subset beyond the influence of the decision-maker or the adversary controlling the job sizes. We assume that $I$ is a subset of $[n]$ of size $B$ taken uniformly at random.\nAssuming that $I$ is a subset of $[n]$ of size $B$, taken uniformly at random,\nwe examine the limitations and possible improvements of non-clairvoyant algorithms.\n\n\n\\subsection{Contributions}\nWe initiate our analysis by addressing the scenario of perfect predictions. We establish a lower bound on the $(n, B)$-competitive ratio of any algorithm (for fixed $n \\geq 2$ and $B \\leq n$), which extends the lower bound of $2 - \\frac{4}{n+3}$ in the non-clairvoyant case \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}. Considering that $B =  wn + o(n)$ for some $w \\in [0,1]$, we derive from the prior bound that the competitive ratio of any algorithm is at least $2 - w - (\\frac{4}{e}-1)w(1-w)$, and we show an improved bound of $2 - w - (3-2\\sqrt{2})w(1-w)$.  Demonstrating these bounds is considerably more challenging than the case $B = 0$, due to the eventual dependency between the actions of the algorithm and the known job sizes.\n \n\nIn the case of perfect predictions, we show that knowing only the relative order of the $B$ job sizes, without knowledge of their values, enables a $(2-\\frac{B}{n})$-competitive algorithm, which improves substantially upon the result of \\cite{benomar2023advice}. \nWe propose a second algorithm leveraging the true sizes of the $B$ jobs, yielding an $(n,B)$-competitive ratio of $(2 - \\frac{B}{n} - \\frac{2(1 - B/n)}{n+1})$, which is strictly better than the former, although both are asymptotically equivalent.\n\n\nSubsequently, we adapt the latter algorithm to handle imperfect predictions. While the difficulty in most works on learning-augmented algorithms lies in ensuring robustness and consistency, smoothness in the case of scheduling with limited predictions is also not immediate.\nAlongside the typical consistency-robustness tradeoff, our algorithm also exhibits a consistency-smoothness tradeoff. More precisely, governed by two hyperparameters $\\lambda, \\rho \\in [0,1]$, the $(n,B)$-competitive ratio of the algorithm is at most \n$\\min(\\frac{2}{1-\\lambda}, \\frac{C}{\\lambda} + \\frac{S}{\\lambda} \\frac{n \\E[\\eta]}{\\OPT})$. \nHere, $\\E[\\eta]$ denotes the total expected prediction error, $\\OPT$ is the objective function achieved by the optimal offline algorithm, $\\frac{2}{1-\\lambda}$ is the algorithm's robustness, $\\frac{C}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}(2 - \\frac{B}{n} + \\rho\\frac{B}{n}(1 - \\frac{B-1}{n-1}))$ its consistency, and $\\frac{S}{\\lambda} = \\frac{1}{\\lambda}( \\frac{4}{\\rho} (1 - \\frac{B}{n}) + \\frac{B}{n})$ its smoothness factor, characterizing the sensitivity of the bound to $\\E[\\eta]$. \nNotably, alterations in the parameter $\\rho$ yield opposing variations on the consistency and the smoothness factor. Nonetheless, this tradeoff vanishes for $B$ close to $0$ or $n$, and does not appear, for instance, in \\cite{purohit2018improving}, \\cite{bampis2022scheduling} or \\cite{lindermayr2022permutation}.\n\nWe illustrate our results for the case of perfect predictions in Figure \\ref{fig:results}, comparing them with the competitive ratio proved in \\cite{benomar2023advice}. \n\n\\begin{figure}[h!]\n\\begin{center}\n\\centerline{\\includegraphics[width=0.75\\columnwidth]{figs/results.pdf}}\n\\caption{Lower bounds and competitive ratios for $B$ known job sizes.}\n\\label{fig:results}\n\\end{center}\n\\vskip -0.4in\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Related work}\nSince their introduction in \\cite{purohit2018improving, lykouris2018competitive}, learning-augmented algorithms witnessed an exponentially growing interest, as they offered a fresh perspective for revisiting online algorithms, and provided new applications for machine learning in algorithm design \\cite{mitzenmacher2022algorithms} and in the implementation of data structures \\cite{kraska2018case, lin2022learning}. Many fundamental problems in competitive analysis were studied in this setting, such as ski rental \\cite{gollapudi2019online, anand2020customizing, bamas2020primal, diakonikolas2021learning, antoniadis2021learning, maghakian2023applied, shin2023improved}, secretary \\cite{antoniadis2020secretary, dutting2021secretaries}, matching \\cite{dinitz2021faster, chen2022faster, sakaue2022discrete, jin2022online}, caching and metrical task systems \\cite{lykouris2018competitive, chlkedowski2021robust, antoniadis2023online, antoniadis2023paging, christianson2023optimal}. \nIn particular, scheduling is one of the problems that were studied most thoroughly. Different works cover various objective functions \\cite{purohit2018improving, lattanzi2020online, azar2021flow}, prediction types \\cite{antoniadis2021novel, merlis2023preemption, lassota2023minimalistic}, error metrics \\cite{im2021non, lindermayr2022permutation}, and other aspects and applications \\cite{wei2020optimal, bamas2020learning, dinitz2022algorithms}\n\nThe setting of learning-augmented algorithms with limited predictions was initially explored by \\citet{im2022parsimonious} for caching. The authors presented an algorithm using parsimonious predictions, with a competitive ratio increasing with the number of allowed queries. In another very recent paper \\cite{sadek2024algorithms}, a similar setting is studied for the more general problem of metrical task systems, where the algorithm is allowed to query a reduced number of \\textit{action predictions} \\cite{antoniadis2023online}, each giving the state of an optimal algorithm at the respective query step. An additional related study by \\citet{drygala2023online} focuses on the ski-rental and Bahncard problems in a penalized adaptation of the setting with limited advice, where the cost of the predictions is added to the algorithm's objective function. \nOther works have explored related settings with different types of limited advice. For instance, the setting with a restricted number of perfect hints was examined in the context of online linear optimization by \\citep{bhaskara2021logarithmic} and in the multi-color secretary problem by \\citep{benomar2023addressing}. Another setting, where the algorithm can query two types of hints—one that is free but possibly inaccurate, and another that is expensive but accurate—has been studied in several problems, such as correlation clustering \\citep{silwal2023kwikbucks}, computing minimum spanning trees in a metric space \\citep{bateni2023metric}, sorting \\cite{bai2024sorting}, and matroid optimization \\citep{eberle2024accelerating}.\nIn the context of scheduling, \\citet{benomar2023advice} introduced the $B$-clairvoyant scheduling problem, where an algorithm can query the exact sizes of $B$ jobs at any moment during its execution. They show that the optimal strategy involves querying the sizes of $B$ jobs selected uniformly at random at the beginning of the process. They establish that, if $B = o(n)$, then the competitive ratio of any algorithm is at least $2$, then they provide a $\\big(2-\\frac{B(B-1)}{n(n-1)}\\big)$-competitive algorithm. The same paper also addresses the secretary problem with restricted access to binary predictions of known accuracy, and the ski-rental problem with access to an oracle whose accuracy improves progressively over time. \n\nThe limit scenario $B = 0$ corresponds to the non-clairvoyant scheduling problem, studied in-depth in \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}. In particular, the paper demonstrates that the competitive ratio of any non-clairvoyant algorithm is at least $2$, and that it is achieved by the \\textit{round-robin} algorithm, executing all unfinished jobs concurrently at equal rates. On the other hand, $B=n$ corresponds to the setting presented in \\cite{purohit2018improving}, where the authors introduce, for all $\\lambda \\in (0,1)$, a \\textit{preferential round-robin} algorithm with robustness $\\frac{2}{1-\\lambda}$ and consistency $\\frac{1}{\\lambda}$.\n\n\n\\subsection{Problem and notations}\nThe decision-maker is given $n$ jobs $i \\in [n]$ with unknown sizes $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ to schedule on a single machine, and predictions $(y_i)_{i \\in I}$ of $(x_i)_{i \\in I}$, with $I$ a uniformly random subset of $[n]$ of size $B$. The objective is to leverage the available predictions to minimize the sum of the completion times. We assume that preemption is allowed, i.e. it is possible to interrupt the execution of a job and resume it later, which is equivalent, by neglecting the preemption cost, to assuming that the jobs can be run in parallel at rates that sum to at most $1$.\n\nTo simplify the presentation, we consider that there are predictions $y_1,\\ldots,y_n$ of $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$, but the decision-maker has only access to $y_{\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, y_{\\sigma(B)}$, where $\\sigma$ is a uniformly random permutation of $[n]$. We denote by $\\eta_i = |x_i - y_i|$ the error of the prediction $y_i$, \nand by $\\eta^\\sigma = \\sum_{i=1}^B \\eta_{\\sigma(i)}$ the total error of the predictions accessed by the algorithm. \nConsider an algorithm $\\A$ and an instance $x = (x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ of job sizes, we denote by $\\A(x)$ the sum of the completion times of all the jobs when executed by $\\A$.\nFurthermore, for all $i \\neq j \\in [n]$ and $t>0$, we denote by \n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item $\\spt_i^\\A(t)$ the processing time spent on job $i$ until time $t$,\n    \\item $t_i^\\A = \\inf\\{ t \\geq 0: \\spt_i^\\A(t) = x_i\\}$ its completion time,\n    \\item $D^\\A_{ij} = \\spt_i^\\A(t^\\A_j)$ the total time spent on job $i$ before job $j$ terminates,\n    \\item and $P^\\A_{ij} = D^\\A_{ij} + D^\\A_{ji}$ the mutual delay caused by $i,j$ to each other.\n\\end{itemize}\nWhen there is no ambiguity, we omit writing the dependency to $\\A$.\nWith these notations, it holds that $t^\\A_i = x_i + \\sum_{j \\neq i} D^\\A_{ji}$ for all $i \\in [n]$. Consequently, the objective function of $\\A$ can be expressed as\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:generic-output}\n\\A(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n} P^\\A_{ij} \\;.    \n\\end{equation}\nObserving that, for all $i \\neq j \\in [n]$, if $i$ terminates before $j$ then $P^\\A_{ij} \\geq x_i$, otherwise $P^\\A_{ij} \\geq x_j$, we deduce that $P^\\A_{ij} \\geq \\min(x_i, x_j)$. Equality is achieved by the clairvoyant algorithm that runs the jobs until completion in non-decreasing size order \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}, which is the optimal offline algorithm, that we denote $\\OPT$, satisfying\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:opt-output}\n\\OPT(x)\n= \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i + \\sum_{1 \\leq i < j \\leq n} \\min(x_i,x_j)\\;.\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nWhen the predictions are perfect, for all $n \\geq 2$ and $B \\leq n$, we define the $(n,B)$-competitive ratio of algorithm $\\A$ as the worst-case ratio between its objective, knowing the sizes of $B$ jobs taken uniformly at random, and that of $\\OPT$, on instances of $n$ jobs\n\\begin{equation*}\n    \\ratio_{n,B}(\\A) = \\sup_{x\\in (0,\\infty)^n} \\frac{\\E[\\A(x)]}{\\OPT(x)}\\;,\n\\end{equation*}\nwhere the expectation $\\E[\\A(x)]$ is taken over the permutation $\\sigma$ and the actions of $\\A$ if it a randomized algorithm. \n\nIf the number of predictions depends on the number of jobs, i.e.  $B = (B_n)_{n \\geq 1}$ defines a sequence of integers, then the competitive ratio of $\\A$ is defined by\n\\begin{equation*}\n\\CR_B(\\A) = \\sup_{n \\geq 2} \\ratio_{n,B_n}(\\A)\\;.\n\\end{equation*}\nWhen the predictions are imperfect, the competitive ratio becomes also a function of $\\E[\\eta^\\sigma]$. \n\n\n\n\\section{Lower Bounds}\n\nIn this section, we assume that the predictions are error-free, and we establish lower bounds on the $(n,B)$-competitive ratio of any algorithm, followed by a lower bound independent of $n$ when $B_n = w n + o(n)$ for some $w \\in [0,1]$.\nThese lower bounds are obtained by constructing random job size instances $x$ such that, for any deterministic algorithm $\\A$, the ratio $\\E_{\\sigma,x}[\\A(x)]/ \\E_x[\\OPT(x)]$ is above them. The result then extends to randomized algorithms and yields bounds on their $(n,B)$-competitive ratio by using Lemma \\ref{lem:yao}, which is a consequence of Yao's principle \\cite{yao1977probabilistic}. \n\nIn all this section, we consider i.i.d. job sizes. Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that the $B$ known job sizes are $x_1,\\ldots,x_B$. \n\nIn the non-clairvoyant case $B=0$, for any algorithm $\\A$, taking i.i.d. exponentially distributed sizes gives, with easy computation, that $\\E[P^\\A_{ij}] = 1$ (Remark \\ref{rmk:uij-nonclairvoyant}), which yields, using Equations \\eqref{eq:generic-output} and \\eqref{eq:opt-output}, the lower bound $2 - \\frac{4}{n+3}$ on the competitive ratio \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}. However, if $B > 0$, the algorithm can act according to the information it has on $(x_i)_{i \\in I}$, and the dependence between its actions and these job sizes makes the analysis more sophisticated.\nFor any positive and continuous function $\\phi$, and positive numbers $T \\geq x > 0$ we denote\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:Gphi}\nG_\\phi(x,T) = \\int_0^{T-x} \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)} + \\frac{x}{\\phi(T-x)}\\;.\n\\end{equation}\nWe prove in the following theorem a generic lower bound, using job sizes sampled independently from the distribution $\\Pr(x_i \\leq t) = 1-\\frac{\\varphi(0)}{\\varphi(t)}$.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:lower-bound}\nLet $\\phi : [0,\\infty) \\to [0,\\infty)$ be a continuously differentiable and increasing function satisfying $\\phi(0) > 0$, $\\phi'/\\phi$ is non-increasing and  $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)^2} < \\infty$, and let $\\alpha_\\phi$ a non-negative constant satisfying\n\\begin{equation}\\label{eq:thm-lb-eq}\n\\int_0^\\infty \\left\\{ \\inf_{T \\geq x} G_\\phi(x,T) \\right\\} \\frac{\\phi'(x)}{\\phi(x)^2} dx\n\\geq \\alpha_\\phi \\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)^2}\\;.    \n\\end{equation}\nIf $B = wn + o(n)$ for some $w \\in [0,1]$, then it holds for any randomized algorithm $\\A$ that\n\\[\n\\CR_B(\\A) \\geq 2 - 2(2-\\alpha_\\phi) w + (3 - 2\\alpha_\\phi)w^2\\;.\n\\]\nMoreover, if $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)} < \\infty$, then for all $n \\geq 2$ and $B \\leq n$ \n\\[\n\\ratio_{n,B}(\\A)\n\\geq C_{\\phi,n,B} - \\frac{C_{\\phi,n,B} - 1}{1+ \\frac{n-1}{2} \\frac{\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)^2}}{\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)}}} \\;,\n\\]\nwhere $C_{\\phi,n,B} \n= (2 - \\tfrac{B}{n}) - (3 - 2 \\alpha_\\phi) \\tfrac{B}{n}\\big(1 - \\tfrac{B-1}{n-1} \\big)$.\n\\end{theorem}\n\nTo establish this theorem, we analyze i.i.d. job sizes sampled from the distribution $\\Pr(x_i \\leq t) = 1-\\frac{\\varphi(0)}{\\varphi(t)}$. We derive in Lemma \\ref{lem:generic-lb} a lower bound on the mutual delays incurred by these jobs during the run of any algorithm $\\A$. This involves solving a functional minimization problem, whose solution is expressed using the function $G_\\phi$ defined in \\eqref{eq:Gphi}. The left term in Inequality \\eqref{eq:thm-lb-eq} is proportional to the obtained lower bound, while the right term is proportional to $\\E[\\min(x_i,x_j)]$, which is the mutual delay caused in a run of $\\OPT$. Finally, using the identity \\eqref{eq:generic-output}, this inequality, which relates the mutual delays caused respectively by executing $\\A$ and $\\OPT$ on the chosen job sizes, can be extended to an inequality involving the objectives of both algorithms, giving a lower bound on the competitive ratio.\n\nIf $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)} = \\infty$, the expectation of the job sizes is infinite. In this case, we consider a truncated distribution with a maximum $a > 0$. After completing the analysis, we derive a lower bound that depends on $a$ and $w$, by considering $B = wn + o(n)$ and $n \\to \\infty$, then, we conclude by taking the limit $a \\to \\infty$.\nFor any value $\\alpha_\\phi$ in Theorem \\ref{thm:lower-bound}, observe that $C_{\\phi,n,0} = 2$ and $C_{\\phi,n,n} = 1$, which means that the lower bound interpolates properly the non-clairvoyant and clairvoyant settings. The remaining task is to choose an adequate function $\\phi$ satisfying the conditions of the theorem with $\\alpha_\\phi$ as large as possible. We first consider exponentially distributed job sizes, often used to prove lower bounds in scheduling problems. This corresponds to $\\phi(t) = e^t$.\n\n\\begin{corollary}\\label{cor:lb-exp}\nFor any algorithm $\\A$, it holds that\n\\[\n\\ratio_{n,B}(\\A)\n\\geq  C_{n,B} - \\frac{4(C_{n,B}-1)}{n+3}\\;,\n\\]\nwith \n$C_{n,B} = 2 - \\frac{B}{n} - (\\tfrac{4}{e} - 1)\\frac{B}{n}\\big(1 - \\frac{B-1}{n-1}\\big)$.\nIn particular, if $B = wn + o(n)$ then\n\\[\n\\CR_B(\\A)\n\\geq (2 - w) - (\\tfrac{4}{e} - 1)w(1-w)\\;.\n\\]\n\\end{corollary}\n\nCorollary \\ref{cor:lb-exp} gives, in particular, that $\\ratio_{n,0}(\\A) \\geq 2 - \\frac{4}{n+3}$, which corresponds exactly to the tight lower bound for the non-clairvoyant scheduling problem \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}. However, the bound is not tight for all values of $B \\leq n$. To refine it, we consider distributions that would be more difficult to process by the algorithm. One idea is to sample a different parameter $\\lambda_i \\sim \\mathcal{E}(1)$ independently for each $i \\in [n]$, then sample $x_i \\sim \\mathcal{E}(\\lambda_i)$. The distribution of $x_i$ in this case is given by\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Pr(x_i \\geq t) \n&= \\int_0^\\infty \\Pr(x_i \\geq t \\mid \\lambda_i = \\lambda) e^{-\\lambda} d\\lambda\\\\\n&= \\int_0^\\infty e^{-(1+t)\\lambda} d\\lambda\n= \\frac{1}{1+t}\\;,    \n\\end{align*}\n\nwhich corresponds to $\\phi(t) = 1+t$. More generally, we consider $\\phi(t) = (1+t)^r$ for $r \\in (\\tfrac{1}{2},1]$. \nSuch functions $\\phi$ correspond to distributions with a heavy tale and with infinite expectation (i.e. $\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{dt}{\\phi(t)} = \\infty$). Using Theorem \\ref{thm:lower-bound}, they only yield lower bounds on the competitive ratio but not on $\\ratio_{n,B}$. Corollary \\ref{cor:lb-phir} shows the bound obtained for $r \\to \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\n\\begin{corollary}\\label{cor:lb-phir}\nLet $w \\in [0,1]$. If $B = wn+o(n)$, then it holds for any algorithm $\\A$ that\n\\[\n\\CR_B(\\A) \\geq (2 - w) - (3-2\\sqrt{2}) w(1-w)\\;.\n\\]\n\\end{corollary}\n\n\\begin{remark}\nIf $x_i$ is sampled from the distribution induced by $\\phi(t) = (1+t)^r$, then $x_i+1$ follows a Pareto distribution with scale 1 and shape $r$ \\cite{arnold2014pareto}, which is commonly used to model the distribution of job sizes in the context of the scheduling problem.\n\\end{remark}\n\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Known Partial Order}\n\n\nBefore investigating the problem within the learning-augmented framework, we introduce an algorithm exclusively for the scenario with perfect information. Subsequently, in Section \\ref{sec:switch}, we present a second algorithm, that we adapt to handle possibly erroneous predictions.\n\nThe optimal algorithm $\\OPT$ does not necessitate precise knowledge of job sizes. Instead, it relies solely on their ordering. This observation suggests that it might be possible to improve the competitive ratio of the non-clairvoyant case by only knowing the relative order of a subset of the job sizes.\nTherefore, rather than having access to the values $x_{\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, x_{\\sigma(B)}$, we assume that the decision-maker is only given a priority ordering $\\pi$ of them, i.e. a bijection $\\pi : [B] \\to \\sigma([B])$ satisfying $x_{\\pi(1)} \\leq \\ldots \\leq x_{\\pi(B)}$. \n\n\\begin{algorithm}[h!]\n   \\caption{Catch-up and Resume Round-Robin ($\\CRRR$)}\n   \\label{algo:orderonly}\n\\begin{algorithmic}\n   \\STATE {\\bfseries Input:} Ordering $\\pi$ of $x_{\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, x_{\\sigma(1)}$\n   \\STATE Set $x_{\\pi(0)} = 0$\n   \\FOR{$i=1$ {\\bfseries to} $B$}\n        \\STATE Run job $\\pi(i)$ for $x_{\\pi(i-1)}$ units of time\n        \\WHILE{job $\\pi(i)$ is not finished}\n            \\STATE Run round-robin on $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j>B} \\cup \\{\\pi(i)\\}$\n        \\ENDWHILE\n   \\ENDFOR\n   \\STATE Run round-robin on $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j=B+1}^n$ until completion\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\nIn Algorithm \\ref{algo:orderonly} ($\\CRRR$), for all $i \\in [B]$, the execution of job $\\pi(i)$ starts only upon the completion of job $\\pi(i-1)$. At this moment, all jobs $\\sigma(j)$ for $j > B$ are either completed or have undergone execution for $x_{\\pi(i-1)}$ units of time. $\\CRRR$ then runs job $\\pi(i)$ for a period of length $x_{\\pi(i-1)}$ to catch up with the progress of the jobs $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j>B}$. Following this synchronization phase, it runs round-robin on the set of jobs $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j>B} \\cup \\{\\pi(i)\\}$ until $\\pi(i)$ terminates. The same process iterates with $\\pi(i+1)$ afterward.\nOnce all the jobs $\\sigma(i)$ for $i \\in [B]$ are completed, the algorithm runs round robin on the unfinished jobs in $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j >B}$.\n\nLeveraging the ordering $\\pi$, the algorithm aims to minimize the delays caused by longer jobs to shorter ones. In the ideal scenario where $B=n$, each job begins execution only after all shorter ones have been completed. When $B<n$, it is evident that the jobs $\\{\\sigma(i)\\}_{i \\in [B]}$ should be executed in the order specified by $\\pi$. However, $\\CRRR$ takes advantage of this ordering even further, ensuring that job $x_{\\pi(i)}$ not only avoids delaying $x_{\\pi(i-1)}$ but also does not delay any job $\\sigma(j)$ with $j>B$ that has a size at most $x_{\\pi(i-1)}$.\n\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:orderonly}\nAlgorithm  $\\CRRR$ satisfies\n\\[\n2 - \\frac{B}{n}  \n - \\frac{2(1-\\frac{B}{n})}{(n+1)(B+1)}\n\\leq \\ratio_{n,B}(\\CRRR) \n\\leq 2 - \\frac{B}{n}\\;.\n\\]\nMoreover, if $B = \\lfloor wn \\rfloor$ for some $w \\in [0,1]$, then $\\CR(\\CRRR) = 2 - w$.\n\\end{theorem}\nTheorem \\ref{thm:orderonly} shows a substantially stronger result than the one presented in \\cite{benomar2023advice}, where the algorithm leveraging the values of the job sizes $x_{\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, x_{\\sigma(B)}$ is only $\\big(2 - \\frac{B(B-1)}{n(n-1)}\\big)$-competitive. \n\\paragraph{Action predictions}\nThe information provided to $\\CRRR$ is the order in which the jobs $\\{\\sigma(i)\\}_{i \\in [B]}$ would be executed by $\\OPT$. This corresponds to the error-free scenario of \\textit{action predictions} \\cite{antoniadis2023online, lindermayr2022permutation, lassota2023minimalistic, sadek2024algorithms}, where the decision-maker receives predictions regarding the actions taken by the optimal offline algorithm, rather than numeric predictions of unknown parameters.\nIn the context of the scheduling problem, utilizing the $\\ell_1$ norm to measure the error is not ideal for analyzing the action prediction setting \\cite{im2021non}. Alternative error metrics, which account for the number of inversions in the predicted permutation in comparison to the true one \\cite{lindermayr2022permutation}, would be more suitable. \nTherefore, adapting $\\CRRR$ to imperfect action predictions is left for future research as it requires different considerations. For now, we shift our focus to introducing another algorithm that utilizes not only the priority order induced by the job sizes, but the size values themselves.\n\n\n\n\\section{Predictions of the Job Sizes}\n\n\nWe propose in this section a generic algorithm $\\switch$, which we will adapt in the cases of perfect and imperfect predictions. The algorithm takes as input $n$ jobs with unknown sizes and breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(1)},\\ldots,z_{\\sigma(B)}$ that depend on the predictions of $x_{\\sigma(1)},\\ldots,x_{\\sigma(B)}$, then it alternates running round-robin on the jobs $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j>B}$ and \\textit{Shortest Predicted Job First} (SPJF), introduced in  \\cite{purohit2018improving}, on the jobs $\\{\\sigma(i)\\}_{i \\in [B]}$, where the moment of switching from an algorithm to another is determined by the breakpoints.\n\nAs in Section \\ref{sec:orderonly}, we call \\textit{ordering} of $z_{\\sigma(1)},\\ldots,z_{\\sigma(B)}$ any bijective application $\\pi : [B] \\to \\sigma([B])$ satisfying $z_{\\pi(1)} \\leq \\ldots \\leq z_{\\pi(B)}$. Note that, if the breakpoints are not pairwise distinct, then the ordering is not unique. In that case, $\\switch$ chooses an ordering $\\pi$ uniformly at random. We assume furthermore that the breakpoints induce the same order as the predictions, i.e. $z_{\\sigma(i)} < z_{\\sigma(j)} \\iff y_{\\sigma(i)} < y_{\\sigma(j)}$ for all $i, j \\in [B]$.\n\n\\begin{algorithm}[h!]\n   \\caption{Switch algorithm $\\switch(z^\\sigma,x)$}\n   \\label{algo:switch}\n\\begin{algorithmic}\n   \\STATE {\\bfseries Input:} Breakpoints $z^\\sigma = (z_{\\sigma(i)})_{i \\in [B]}$\n   \\STATE $\\pi \\gets$ ordering of $z^\\sigma$ chosen uniformly at random\\;\n   \\FOR{$i=1$ {\\bfseries to} $B$}\n        \\WHILE{$\\min\\limits_{j>B} \\frac{\\spt_{\\sigma(j)}(t)}{x_{\\sigma(j)}} < 1$ and $\\max\\limits_{j > B}\\spt_{\\sigma(j)}(t) < z_{\\pi(i)}$}\n            \\STATE Run round-robin on $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j=B+1}^n$\n        \\ENDWHILE\n        \\STATE Run job $\\pi(i)$ until completion\n   \\ENDFOR\n   \\STATE Run round-robin on $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j=B+1}^n$ until completion\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\n\nConsider a run of $\\switch$, and let $i \\in [B]$. The first condition for entering the while loop is the existence of $j > B$ such that $\\spt_{\\sigma(j)}(t) < x_{\\sigma(j)}$. This signifies that the jobs $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j>B}$ are not all completed, which is a verification feasible for the decision-maker without knowledge of the sizes $\\{x_{\\sigma(j)}\\}_{j>B}$.\nThe second condition means that no job $\\sigma(j)$ for $j>B$ has been in execution for more than $z_{\\pi(i)}$ units of time. Given that round-robin allocates equal importance to all jobs $\\{\\sigma(j)\\}_{j>B}$, upon exiting the while loop, each job $\\sigma(j)$ is either completed or has been in execution for precisely $z_{\\pi(i)}$ units of time.\nFollowing this step, job $\\pi(i)$ is executed until completion, and the same process recurs for $i+1$.\nThis algorithm ensures that any job $x_{\\sigma(i)}$ with $i \\leq B$ does not delay any other job $j$ whose size is at most $x_j \\leq z_{\\sigma(i)}$, and the delay it causes to jobs not satisfying this condition is exactly $x_{\\sigma(i)}$. This allows efficient control of the mutual delays between the jobs by conveniently choosing the breakpoints.\n\\subsection{Perfect Predictions}\nAssuming that the predictions are perfect, i.e. the decision-maker knows the exact sizes of jobs ${\\sigma(1)}, \\ldots, {\\sigma(B)}$, it is possible to set $z_{\\sigma(i)} = x_{\\sigma(i)}$ for all $i \\in [B]$.\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:switch-perfect}\nAlgorithm $\\switch$ with breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(i)} = x_{\\sigma(i)}$ for all $i \\in [B]$ satisfies\n\\[\n\\ratio_{n,B}(\\switch) \n= 2 - \\frac{B}{n} - \\frac{2(1 - \\frac{B}{n})}{n+1}\\;.\n\\]\nIn particular, if $B = \\lfloor wn \\rfloor$ for some $w \\in [0,1]$ then $\\CR_B(\\switch) = 2 - w$.\n\\end{theorem}\nNote that the $(n,B)$-competitive ratio above is strictly better than that of $\\CRRR$, presented in Theorem \\ref{thm:orderonly}. However, both algorithms have equivalent performance when $n$ is large. In particular, their competitive ratios coincide when $B = \\lfloor wn \\rfloor$.\n\n\nA slight improvement on the $(n,B)$-competitive ratio can be obtained by introducing randomness into $\\switch$. Indeed, consider the \\textit{Run To Completion} algorithm ($\\textsf{RTC}$) defined in \\cite{motwani1994nonclairvoyant}, executing all the jobs until completion in a uniformly random order. Then we have the following result.\n\n\\begin{proposition}\\label{prop:rand-switch}\nThe algorithm that runs $\\textsf{RTC}$ with probability $\\frac{2(n-B)}{n(n+3) - 2B}$, and runs $\\switch$ with breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(i)} = x_{\\sigma(i)}$ for all $i \\in [B]$ with the remaining probability, has an $(n,B)$-competitive ratio of\n\\[\n2 - \\frac{B}{n} - \\frac{2(1 - \\frac{B}{n})(2 - \\frac{B}{n})}{n+3 - \\frac{2B}{n}}\\;.\n\\]\n\\end{proposition}\n\nFor $B=0$, the ratio above becomes $2 - \\frac{4}{n+3}$, which is the best possible in the non-clairvoyant setting.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Imperfect Predictions}\\label{sec:imperfect-pred}\nWe assume in this section that no quality guarantees are given on the predictions $\\{y_{\\sigma(i)}\\}_{i \\in [B]}$. Recall that the total error $\\eta^\\sigma = \\sum_{i=1}^B |x_{\\sigma(i)} - y_{\\sigma(i)}|$ is a random variable because $\\sigma$ is a uniformly random permutation of $[n]$, hence our results will depend on $\\E[\\eta^\\sigma]$.\n\nThe goal\nis to design an algorithm that is consistent, robust, and with a competitive ratio having a smooth dependency to $\\E[\\eta^\\sigma]$.\nWe first study the consistency and smoothness of $\\switch$ with well-chosen breakpoints, then we show that combining it with round-robin as in \\cite{purohit2018improving, lassota2023minimalistic} gives robustness guarantees.\n\nUsing the trivial breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(i)} = y_{\\sigma(i)}$ as in the previous section is not enough to guarantee smoothness. Consider, for example, job sizes all equal to 1, and $B$ predictions $y_{\\sigma(i)} = 1 - \\epsilon$ for an arbitrarily small $\\epsilon$. Blindly following these predictions, taking $z_{\\sigma(i)} = y_{\\sigma(i)}$ for all $i \\in [B]$, results in delaying all jobs with unknown sizes by $B$ time units compared to the case of perfect predictions. This creates a discontinuity in the competitive ratio when $\\epsilon$ becomes positive, proving non-smoothness. Hence, we consider instead randomized breakpoints. \n\n\\begin{algorithm}[h!]\n   \\caption{imperfect predictions $\\switch(\\xi y^\\sigma, x)$}\n   \\label{algo:any-pred}\n\\begin{algorithmic}\n   \\STATE {\\bfseries Input:} predictions $(y_{\\sigma(i)})_{i \\in [B]}$, distribution $F$\n   \\STATE Sample $\\xi \\sim F$\\;\n   \\STATE Run $\\switch$ with breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(i)} = \\xi y_{\\sigma(i)}$\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\nAlgorithm \\ref{algo:any-pred} simply runs $\\switch$ with random breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(i)} = \\xi y_{\\sigma(i)}$. \nThe following lemma gives an upper bound on the algorithm's objective function depending on the distribution $F$ of $\\xi$.\n\n\\begin{lemma}\\label{lem:alg-output-F}\nLet $F$ be a probability distribution on $(0,\\infty)$, and consider the mappings $h_F: (0,\\infty)^2 \\to \\R$ and $g_F: (0,\\infty) \\to \\R$ defined by\n\\begin{align*}\nh_F(s,t) &= t \\cdot {\\textstyle \\Pr_{\\xi\\sim F}}(\\xi < \\tfrac{s}{t})\\\\\ng_F(s) &= (1-s) {\\textstyle \\Pr_{\\xi\\sim F}}(\\xi<s) + \\E_{\\xi\\sim F}[\\xi \\indic{\\xi < s}]\\;.  \n\\end{align*}\nLet $\\beta_F = \\sup_{s \\in (0, 1]}\\frac{g_F(s)}{s}$ and $\\gamma_F = \\sup_{s \\geq 1} (g_F(s) + s)$.

Indeed, as $\\rho$ decreases, the algorithm gains in consistency, but the term $\\left( \\tfrac{4}{\\rho}(1 - \\tfrac{B}{n}) + \\tfrac{B}{n} \\right)$ multiplying $\\E[\\eta^\\sigma]$ becomes larger. However, while setting $\\rho$ close to zero results in an arbitrarily high sensitivity to the error, setting it close to $1$ gives consistency of at most $\\big(2 - \\frac{B(B-1)}{n(n-1)}\\big)$, which is still a decreasing function of $B$, interpolating the values $2$ and $1$ in the clairvoyant and non-clairvoyant cases. This implies that sacrificing a small amount of consistency significantly improves smoothness.\nFor $B = n$, assuming that all the job sizes are at least $1$, it holds that $\\OPT(x) \\geq n(n+1)/2$ and the lemma gives $\\ratio_{n,B}(\\eta;\\switch) \\leq 1 + \\frac{2 \\eta}{n}$, matching the bound proved on (SPJF) in \\cite{purohit2018improving}. On the other hand, if $\\eta = 0$, setting $\\rho = 0$ results in $\\ratio_{n,B}(0;\\switch) \\leq 2 - \\frac{B}{n}$.\n\n\\paragraph{Preferential algorithm}\nNow we need to adapt the algorithm to guarantee robustness in the face of arbitrarily erroneous predictions. We use the same approach as Lemma 3.1 of \\cite{purohit2018improving}, which consists of running concurrently a consistent algorithm and round-robin at respective rates $\\lambda$, $1-\\lambda$ for some $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$. However, their result only applies for deterministic algorithms $\\A$ satisfying for any instances $x = (x_1,\\ldots,x_n)$ and $x' = (x'_1,\\ldots,x'_n)$ that\n\\[\n\\big(\\forall i \\in [n]: x_i \\leq x'_i\\big)\n\\implies \\A(x) \\leq \\A(x')\\;.\n\\]\nSuch algorithms are called \\textit{monotonic}. $\\switch$ with breakpoints $z_{\\sigma(i)} = \\xi y_{\\sigma(i)}$ is not deterministic since its objective function depends both on $\\sigma$ and $\\xi$. Nonetheless, we overcome this difficulty by proving that, conditionally to $\\sigma$ and $\\xi$, its outcome is deterministic and monotonic, then we establish the following theorem.\n\n\\begin{theorem}\\label{thm:preferential-algo}\nLet $\\rho \\in (0,1]$ and $F = 1 + \\mathcal{E}(1/\\rho)$. Then the preferential algorithm $\\ALG_\\lambda$ which runs Algorithm \\ref{algo:any-pred} at rate $\\lambda$ and round-robin at rate $1-\\lambda$ has an $(n,B)$-competitive ratio of at most\n\\[\n\\min\\left( \\frac{2}{1 - \\lambda} \\;,\\; \\frac{C_{\\rho,n,B}}{\\lambda} +  \\frac{S_{\\rho,n,B}}{\\lambda} \\cdot \\frac{n \\E[\\eta^\\sigma] }{\\OPT(x)}\\right)\\;,\n\\]\nwith\n\\begin{align*}\nC_{\\rho,n,B} &= \\big(2 - \\tfrac{B}{n}\\big) + \\rho \\tfrac{B}{n}\\big(1 - \\tfrac{B-1}{n-1}\\big) \\\\\nS_{\\rho,n,B} &= \\tfrac{4}{\\rho}\\big(1 - \\tfrac{B}{n}\\big) + \\tfrac{B}{n} \\;.\n\\end{align*}\n\\end{theorem}\nThis upper bound generalizes that of \\cite{purohit2018improving}. It presents a consistency-robustness tradeoff that can be tuned by adjusting the parameter $\\lambda$, and a consistency-smoothness tradeoff controlled by the parameter $\\rho$, which vanishes for $B$ close to $0$ or $n$, as the terms multiplying $\\rho$ and $1/\\rho$ respectively in $C_{\\rho,n,B}$ and $S_{\\rho,n,B}$ become zero.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n## Experimental Setup\n\n```json\n[{\"name\": \"Lower Bounds\", \"description\": \"This section focuses on establishing lower bounds on the (n,B)-competitive ratio of any algorithm in the case of perfect predictions.

The Pareto distribution, known for its heavy tail, is particularly suitable for modeling job sizes \\cite{harchol1997exploiting, bansal2001analysis, arnold2014pareto}, and it is a commonly used benchmark for learning-augmented scheduling algorithms \\cite{purohit2018improving, lindermayr2022permutation}.

When $\\lambda = 0$, PA becomes round-robin.

The choice of $\\rho = 0$ exhibits a slightly better consistency compared to $\\rho=0.5$, in line with theoretical expectations, but there is no significant difference regarding sensitivity to errors. This should not be surprising since setting $\\rho > 0$ ensures smoothness in the worst-case (see Figure \\ref{fig:consistency-smoothness}), but it is not necessarily needed for all instances.\n\nThe right plot examines the influence of $B$ on PA with parameters $\\lambda = 1$ and $\\rho=0.5$, which corresponds to\n$\\switch$ with $\\rho = 0.5$. Larger $B$ values improve consistency and also yield a smaller sensitivity to small errors. However, for high $\\tau$ values, having numerous predictions leads to faster performance deterioration compared to having fewer predictions.

We give near optimal lower and upper bounds in the case of perfect predictions, and we introduce a learning-augmented algorithm raising the common consistency-robustness tradeoff and an additional consistency-smoothness tradeoff, the latter vanishing when $B$ approaches $0$ or $n$.\n\nOur findings join previous works in demonstrating that online algorithms can indeed achieve improved performance even when armed with a restricted set of predictions, which is an assumption more aligned with practical scenarios. Furthermore, they affirm the necessity of studying and understanding these regimes, as they may unveil unique behaviors absent in the zero- or full-information settings.\n\n\\subsection{Open Questions}\n\n\\paragraph{Tight lower bounds} In the case of perfect predictions, there is\na (small) gap between the lower bounds of Section \\ref{sec:lowerbounds} and the competitive ratios of $\\switch$ and $\\CRRR$. An interesting research avenue is to close this gap, either by designing better algorithms or improving the lower bound. This could involve using Theorem \\ref{thm:lower-bound} with more refined distributions.\n\n\\paragraph{Reduced number of action predictions} Algorithm $\\switch$ leverages the job sizes' predictions, not only the order they induce. Using the $\\ell_1$ norm to measure the error is thus a suitable choice. However, as discussed in Section \\ref{sec:orderonly}, Algorithm $\\CRRR$ only uses the priority order in which $\\OPT$ runs $(x_{\\sigma(i)})_{i \\in [B]}$. An interesting question to explore is how to adapt it in the case of imperfect \\textit{action predictions}, using appropriate error measures.\n\n\\paragraph{Smooth and $(2-\\frac{B}{n})$-consistent algorithm}\nLemma \\ref{lem:switch-exp} and Figure \\ref{fig:consistency-smoothness} emphasize that, to achieve smoothness, $\\switch$ with parameter $\\rho$ must exhibit a consistency exceeding $2 - \\frac{B}{n}$. A compelling question arises: Is it possible to devise a smooth algorithm with a consistency of at most $2 - \\frac{B}{n}$? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n"

        "abstract": "In various real-world scenarios, interactions among agents often resemble the dynamics of general-sum games, where each agent strives to optimize its own utility. Despite the ubiquitous relevance of such settings, decentralized machine learning algorithms have struggled to find equilibria that maximize individual utility while preserving social welfare. In this paper we introduce Learning with Opponent Q-Learning Awareness (LOQA), a novel, decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm tailored to optimizing an agent's individual utility while fostering cooperation among adversaries in partially competitive environments. LOQA assumes the opponent samples actions proportionally to their action-value function Q. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of LOQA at achieving state-of-the-art performance in benchmark scenarios such as the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma and the Coin Game. LOQA achieves these outcomes with a significantly reduced computational footprint, making it a promising approach for practical multi-agent applications.\n",

                "abstract": "We investigate the challenge of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning in partially competitive environments, where traditional methods struggle to foster reciprocity-based cooperation. LOLA and POLA agents learn reciprocity-based cooperative policies by differentiation through a few look-ahead optimization steps of their opponent. However, there is a key limitation in these techniques. Because they consider a few optimization steps, a learning opponent that takes many steps to optimize its return may exploit them. In response, we introduce a novel approach, Best Response Shaping (BRS), which differentiates through an opponent approximating the best response, termed the\"detective.\"To condition the detective on the agent's policy for complex games we propose a state-aware differentiable conditioning mechanism, facilitated by a question answering (QA) method that extracts a representation of the agent based on its behaviour on specific environment states. To empirically validate our method, we showcase its enhanced performance against a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) opponent, which serves as an approximation to the best response in the Coin Game. This work expands the applicability of multi-agent RL in partially competitive environments and provides a new pathway towards achieving improved social welfare in general sum games."

LOLA (arXiv:1709.04326) accounts for this by differentiating through one step of optimization. We propose to judge joint policies by their long-term prospects as measured by the meta-value, a discounted sum over the returns of future optimization iterates. We apply a form of Q-learning to the meta-game of optimization, in a way that avoids the need to explicitly represent the continuous action space of policy updates. The resulting method, MeVa, is consistent and far-sighted, and does not require REINFORCE estimators. We analyze the behavior of our method on a toy game and compare to prior work on repeated matrix games."

                "abstract": "A fundamental challenge in multiagent reinforcement learning is to learn beneficial behaviors in a shared environment with other agents that are also simultaneously learning. In particular, each agent perceives the environment as effectively non-stationary due to the changing policies of other agents. Moreover, each agent is itself constantly learning, leading to natural nonstationarity in the distribution of experiences encountered. In this paper, we propose a novel meta-multiagent policy gradient theorem that directly accommodates for the non-stationary policy dynamics inherent to these multiagent settings. This is achieved by modeling our gradient updates to directly consider both an agent's own non-stationary policy dynamics and the non-stationary policy dynamics of other agents interacting with it in the environment. We find that our theoretically grounded approach provides a general solution to the multiagent learning problem, which inherently combines key aspects of previous state of the art approaches on this topic. We test our method on several multiagent benchmarks and demonstrate a more efficient ability to adapt to new agents as they learn than previous related approaches across the spectrum of mixed incentive, competitive, and cooperative environments."

Opponent shaping is a powerful approach to improve learning dynamics in these games, accounting for player influence on others' updates. Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA) is a recent algorithm that exploits this response and leads to cooperation in settings like the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Although experimentally successful, we show that LOLA agents can exhibit 'arrogant' behaviour directly at odds with convergence. In fact, remarkably few algorithms have theoretical guarantees applying across all (n-player, non-convex) games. In this paper we present Stable Opponent Shaping (SOS), a new method that interpolates between LOLA and a stable variant named LookAhead. We prove that LookAhead converges locally to equilibria and avoids strict saddles in all differentiable games. SOS inherits these essential guarantees, while also shaping the learning of opponents and consistently either matching or outperforming LOLA experimentally."

                "abstract": "The score function estimator is widely used for estimating gradients of stochastic objectives in Stochastic Computation Graphs (SCG), eg. in reinforcement learning and meta-learning. While deriving the first-order gradient estimators by differentiating a surrogate loss (SL) objective is computationally and conceptually simple, using the same approach for higher-order gradients is more challenging. Firstly, analytically deriving and implementing such estimators is laborious and not compliant with automatic differentiation. Secondly, repeatedly applying SL to construct new objectives for each order gradient involves increasingly cumbersome graph manipulations. Lastly, to match the first-order gradient under differentiation, SL treats part of the cost as a fixed sample, which we show leads to missing and wrong terms for higher-order gradient estimators. To address all these shortcomings in a unified way, we introduce DiCE, which provides a single objective that can be differentiated repeatedly, generating correct gradient estimators of any order in SCGs. Unlike SL, DiCE relies on automatic differentiation for performing the requisite graph manipulations. We verify the correctness of DiCE both through a proof and through numerical evaluation of the DiCE gradient estimates.

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds."

                "abstract": "Multi-agent settings are quickly gathering importance in machine learning. This includes a plethora of recent work on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, but also can be extended to hierarchical RL, generative adversarial networks and decentralised optimisation. In all these settings the presence of multiple learning agents renders the training problem non-stationary and often leads to unstable training or undesired final results. We present Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), a method in which each agent shapes the anticipated learning of the other agents in the environment. The LOLA learning rule includes a term that accounts for the impact of one agent's policy on the anticipated parameter update of the other agents. Results show that the encounter of two LOLA agents leads to the emergence of tit-for-tat and therefore cooperation in the iterated prisoners' dilemma, while independent learning does not. In this domain, LOLA also receives higher payouts compared to a naive learner, and is robust against exploitation by higher order gradient-based methods. Applied to repeated matching pennies, LOLA agents converge to the Nash equilibrium. In a round robin tournament we show that LOLA agents successfully shape the learning of a range of multi-agent learning algorithms from literature, resulting in the highest average returns on the IPD. We also show that the LOLA update rule can be efficiently calculated using an extension of the policy gradient estimator, making the method suitable for model-free RL. The method thus scales to large parameter and input spaces and nonlinear function approximators. We apply LOLA to a grid world task with an embedded social dilemma using recurrent policies and opponent modelling. By explicitly considering the learning of the other agent, LOLA agents learn to cooperate out of self-interest. The code is at this http URL."

We show both theoretically and experimentally that such agents can maintain cooperation in Markov social dilemmas. Our construction does not require training methods beyond a modification of self-play, thus if an environment is such that good strategies can be constructed in the zero-sum case (eg.

                "abstract": "Many complex decision making problems like scheduling in manufacturing systems, portfolio management in finance, admission control in communication networks etc., with clear and precise objectives, can be formulated as stochastic dynamic programming problems in which the objective of decision making is to maximize a single “overall” reward. In these formulations, finding an optimal decision policy involves computing a certain “value function” which assigns to each state the optimal reward one would obtain if the system was started from that state. This function then naturally prescribes the optimal policy, which is to take decisions that drive the system to states with maximum value. \nFor many practical problems, the computation of the exact value function is intractable, analytically and numerically, due to the enormous size of the state space. Therefore one has to resort to one of the following approximation methods to find a good sub-optimal policy: (1) Approximate the value function. (2) Restrict the search for a good policy to a smaller family of policies. \nIn this thesis, we propose and study actor-critic algorithms which combine the above two approaches with simulation to find the best policy among a parameterized class of policies. Actor-critic algorithms have two learning units: an actor and a critic. An actor is a decision maker with a tunable parameter. A critic is a function approximator. The critic tries to approximate the value function of the policy used by the actor, and the actor in turn tries to improve its policy based on the current approximation provided by the critic. Furthermore, the critic evolves on a faster time-scale than the actor. \nWe propose several variants of actor-critic algorithms. In all the variants, the critic uses Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation. Some of the variants are inspired by a new geometric interpretation of the formula for the gradient of the overall reward with respect to the actor parameters. This interpretation suggests a natural set of basis functions for the critic, determined by the family of policies parameterized by the actor's parameters. We concentrate on the average expected reward criterion but we also show how the algorithms can be modified for other objective criteria. We prove convergence of the algorithms for problems with general (finite, countable, or continuous) state and decision spaces. \nTo compute the rate of convergence (ROC) of our algorithms, we develop a general theory of the ROC of two-time-scale algorithms and we apply it to study our algorithms. In the process, we study the ROC of TD learning and compare it with related methods such as Least Squares TD (LSTD). We study the effect of the basis functions used for linear function approximation on the ROC of TD. We also show that the ROC of actor-critic algorithms does not depend on the actual basis functions used in the critic but depends only on the subspace spanned by them and study this dependence. \nFinally, we compare the performance of our algorithms with other algorithms that optimize over a parameterized family of policies. We show that when only the “natural” basis functions are used for the critic, the rate of convergence of the actor critic algorithms is the same as that of certain stochastic gradient descent algorithms. However, with appropriate additional basis functions for the critic, we show that our algorithms outperform the existing ones in terms of ROC.

                "\nA major difficulty in reinforcement learning (RL) and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the non-stationary nature of the environment, where the outcome of each agent is determined not only by their own actions but also those of other players \\cite{vonNeumann1928}. This difficulty often results in the failure of traditional algorithms converging to desirable solutions. In the context of general-sum games, independent RL agents often converge to sub-optimal solutions in the Pareto sense, when each of them seeks to optimize their own utility \\cite{Foerster2018a}. This situation draws parallels with many real-world scenarios, in which individuals pursuing their own selfish interests leads them to a worse outcome than cooperating with others. Thus one of the objectives of MARL research must be to develop decentralized agents that are able to cooperate while avoiding being exploited in partially competitive settings. We call this reciprocity-based cooperation.\n\nPrevious work has resulted in algorithms that train reciprocity-based cooperative agents by differentiating through the opponent's learning step \\citep{Foerster2018a, Letcher2021, Zhao2022, Willi2022} or by modeling opponent shaping as a meta-game in the space of agent policies \\citep{Alshedivat2018, Kim2021, Lu2022, Cooijmans2023}. However, both of these approaches have important drawbacks with respect to computational efficiency. On one hand, differentiating through even just a few of the opponent’s learning steps, can only be done sequentially and requires building large computation graphs. This is computationally costly when dealing with complex opponent policies. On the other hand, meta-learning  defines the problem as a meta-state over the product space of policies of the agent and opponent, and learns a meta-policy that maps from the meta-state to the agent's updated policy. The complexity of the problem then scales with the policy parameterization which is usually a neural network with many parameters.\n\nIn this paper we introduce Learning with Opponent Q-Learning Awareness (LOQA), which stands because it avoids computing gradients w.r.t. optimization steps or learning the dynamics of a meta-game, resulting in significantly improved computational efficiency. LOQA performs opponent shaping by assuming that the opponent's behavior is guided by an internal action-value function $Q$. This assumption allows LOQA agents to build a model of the opponent policy that can be shaped by influencing its returns for different actions. Controlling the return by differentiating through stochastic objectives is a key idea in RL and can be done using the REINFORCE estimator \\cite{Williams1992}. LOQA is strongly inspired by Best Response Shaping \\cite{aghajohari2024best}. In BRS, the detective approximates the optimal response to an agent by conditioning on the returns from simulated game trajectories between the agent and a random opponent. The agent then differentiates through the detective through these differentiable returns. \n"

                "\n\\subsection{Opponent Shaping}\n\nLearning with opponent learning awareness (LOLA), \\citep{Foerster2018a} introduces the concept of opponent shaping, i.e. the idea of steering the other agent throughout its learning process. LOLA assumes that the opponent is a naive learner and attempts to shape it by considering one step in its optimization process. Rather than optimizing the value under the current policies at the current iteration $i$, $V^1(\\theta_i^1, \\: \\theta_i^2)$, LOLA optimizes $V^1(\\theta_i^1, \\: \\theta_i^2 + \\Delta \\theta_i^2)$ where $\\Delta \\theta_i^2$ is a learning step of the opponent. $\\Delta \\theta_i^2$ is as a function that depends on the agent's parameters and that is thus differentiable with respect to $\\theta^1$. Since the derivative of function $V^1(\\theta_i^1, \\: \\theta_i^2 + \\Delta \\theta_i^2)$ is difficult to compute, the authors consider the surrogate value given by its first order Taylor expansion. POLA, \\citep{Zhao2022} builds an idealized version LOLA that, unlike its predecessor, is invariant to the parameterization of the policy. In a similar fashion to proximal policy optimization (PPO) \\citep{Schulman2017}, each agent increases the probability of actions that increase their expected return, while trying to minimize the $l_2$ distance between the updated policy and the old policy. This combined objective of maximizing the return and minimizing the $l_2$ distance in policy space is equivalent to the Proximal Point method, hence the name Proximal-LOLA or POLA. Other modifications to the original LOLA algorithm attempt to resolve its shortcomings. Consistent learning with opponent learning awareness (COLA), \\citep{Willi2022} attempts to resolve the inherent inconsistency of LOLA assuming that the other agent is a naive learner instead of another LOLA agent. Stable opponent shaping (SOS), \\citep{Letcher2021} introduces an interpolation between LOLA and a more stable variant called \\emph{look ahead}, which has strong theoretical convergence guarantees.\n\n\\subsection{Meta Learning}\n\nOther methods have been used to generate agents that have near optimal behavior in social dilemmas. First used by \\cite{Alshedivat2018} for this setting, meta learning redefines the MARL problem as a meta-game in the space of policy parameters in an attempt to deal with the non-stationary nature of the environment.\nIn this meta-game, the meta-state is the joint policy, the meta-reward is the return on the underlying game, and a meta-action is a change to the inner policy (i.e. the policy in the original game).\nModel free opponent shaping (M-FOS) \\citep{Lu2022} applies policy gradient methods to this meta-game to find a strong meta-policy.\nMeta-Value Learning \\citep{Cooijmans2023} applies value learning to model the long-term effects of policy changes, and uses the gradient of the value as an improvement direction. \n\n"

                "\nSocial dilemmas are a type of decision problem where each party's miopic efforts to maximize their own benefit lead to a less favorable outcome compared to when all parties cooperate. Designed primarily as thought experiments, these dilemmas demonstrate the trade-offs that are often inherent in multi-agent decision-making scenarios. As such, they have been used to model real-life situations in diverse fields such as economics, ecology and policy making. One example of such a decision problem is the famous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD).\n\n\\paragraph{The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD)}\nPD is a game in which each of the two agents or prisoners must decide to either cooperate with one another or defect. The dilemma the prisoners face originates from the reward structure, given in Table \\ref{tab:PD}. With with reward structure, a rational agent will choose to defect no matter what the other agent chooses. As a result, both agents become locked in the defect-defect Nash equilibrium, even though they would achieve greater utility by both choosing to cooperate. \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cc}\n\\diagbox{Agent}{Opponent} & Cooperate & Defect \\\\\n\\hline\nCooperate &  $(-1,-1)$ & $(-3,\\phantom{+}0)$ \\\\\nDefect &  $(\\phantom{+}0,-3)$ & $(-2,-2)$ \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Payoff (or reward) matrix for the Prisoner's Dilemma game, where the numbered pairs corresponds to the payoffs of the Agent and the Opponent respectively.}\n    \\label{tab:PD}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\paragraph{Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD)}\nAs the name implies IPD is simply an (infinitely) repeated version of the Prisoner's Dilemma. Unlike standard PD, IPD offers some hope for rational cooperative behaviour. Originally popularized by \\cite{Axelrod1980}, the IPD has been used to model many hypothetical and real-world scenarios. It has also become a popular test-bed for MARL algorithms attempting to achieve reciprocity based cooperation policies. A simple but effective strategy in the IPD is \\emph{tit-for-tat} (TFT), which consists in cooperating at the first turn and copying the opponent's action thereafter. \n\n\\paragraph{The Coin Game}\nInitially described in \\citep{Lerer2018}, the Coin Game is a grid world environment in which two agents take turns taking coins. At the beginning of each episode a coin of a particular color (red or blue), corresponding to that of one of the two agents, spawns at a random location in the grid. Agents are rewarded for any coin taken, but are punished if the other agent takes the coin corresponding to their color. The reward structure of the Coin Game is designed to incentivize cooperation between agents, as each one would be better off if both take only the coin corresponding to their color. In such way the Coin Game mirrors the IPD, therefore policies that \\emph{cooperate reciprocally} are highly desirable as they achieve better individual and social outcomes. However unlike IPD, the Coin Game is embedded in a non-trivial environment and requires non-trivial policy models. It can be seen as an extension of IPD towards more complex and realistic scenarios. \n\n"

                "Method Description",
                "\nIntuitively, a change in either the agent’s or the opponent’s policy results in a change in the probability measure over the trajectories that are observed when both of them interact in an environment. Since the value function of the \\emph{opponent} is an expectation over said probability measure, it is controllable by the \\emph{agent’s} policy (and vice versa). LOQA leverages this observation to exert influence over the policy that the opponent will learn. \n\nAs an illustration, consider an instance of the IPD game where a LOQA agent and the opponent are initialized to be random agents, i.e. they samples actions from a uniform distribution. If the LOQA agent  increases its probability of defection after the opponent defects, it implicitly decreases the action-value function of the opponent for defecting. The opponent will then learn this and reduce its probability of defecting. Similarly, if the LOQA agent cooperates after the opponent cooperates, it increases the action-value of cooperation for the opponent. In response, the opponent will learn to cooperate more. This reciprocity-based cooperative behavior is the structure behind tit-for-tat.\n\n\\subsection{Modeling the Opponent's Policy}\n\nLet $\\pi^1(b | s) := \\pi(b | s; \\theta^1)$ refer to the policy of the agent and $\\pi^2(b | s) := \\pi(b | s; \\theta^2)$ refer to the policy of the opponent, which are neural networks with parameters $\\theta^1$ and $\\theta^2$. Similarly, $Q^2(s, b) := Q(s, b;\\phi^2)$ denotes the action-value function of the opponent, which is a neural network with parameters $\\phi^2$. \n\nLOQA relies on a key assumption about the opponent's policy. Similar to Soft Actor Critic (SAC) \\citep{Haarnoja2018}, the assumption is that the opponents' actions are sampled from a distribution that is proportional to its action-value function $Q^2(\\cdot)$. More formally, at time $t$, we can write this assumption as\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\pi^2(b_t | s_t) &\\approx \\frac{\\text{exp}(Q^2(s_t, b_t))}{\\sum_{b'} \\text{exp} (Q^2(s_{t}, b'))}\n\\end{align*}\nMore specifically we approximate $Q^2$ with Monte Carlo rollouts $\\mathcal{T}$ of length $T$, where every trajectory $\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}$, $\\tau \\sim \\text{Pr}_{\\mu}^{\\pi^1, \\pi^2}$, starts at state $s_t$ with the opponent taking action $b_t$\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\hat{Q}^2(s_t, b_t) &= \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\mathcal{T}} \\left[R^2(\\tau) | s=s_t, b=b_t\\right] \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{T}|}\\sum_{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\sum_{k=t}^T \\gamma^{k - t} r^2(s_k, a_k, b_k)\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $r^2(s, a, b)$ denotes the opponent's reward at state $s$ after taking action $b$ and the opponent taking action $a$. This empirical expectation of the $Q$ function is controllable by the agent using the reinforce estimator\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\nabla_{\\theta^1} \\hat{Q}^2(s_t, b_t) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\mathcal{T}} \\left[\\sum_{k=t+1}^T \\gamma^{k - t} r^2(s_k, a_k, b_k) \\sum_{t < j < k} \\nabla_{\\theta^1} \\text{log }\\pi^1(a_j | s_j)\\right]\n\\end{align*}\nThe opponent's policy evaluated at state $s_t$ can now be approximated using the Monte Carlo rollout estimate $\\hat{Q}^2$ and the action-value function $Q^2$ as follows\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\label{eqn:pi_approx}\n    \\hat{\\pi}^2(b_t | s_t) := \\frac{\\text{exp}(\\hat{Q}^2(s_t, b_t))}{\\text{exp}(\\hat{Q}^2(s_t, b_t)) + \\sum_{b'\\neq b_t} \\text{exp} (Q^2(s_{t}, b'))}\n\\end{equation}\nNotice that we assume access to the opponent's real action-value function $Q^2$. To have a fully decentralized algorithm we can simply replace $Q^2$ with the agent's own estimate of the opponent's action-value function. We now integrate these ideas into the Actor-Critic formulation. \n\n\\subsection{Opponent Shaping}\n\nIn order to shape the opponent behavior, we factor in the opponent's policy approximation $\\hat{\\pi}^2$ as well as the agent's policy $\\pi^1$ in the probability measure over trajectories. Adapting the original Actor-Critic formulation \\citep{Konda2000} to the joint agent-opponent policy space we have:\n\\begin{align*} \n    \\nabla_{\\theta^1} V^{1}(\\mu) &= \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\text{Pr}_{\\mu}^{\\pi^1, \\pi^2}} \\left[\\sum_{t=0}^T A^{1}(s_t, a_t, b_t)\\nabla_{\\theta^1}\\left(\\text{log }\\pi^1(a_t | s_t) + \\underbrace{\\text{log }\\pi^2(b_t | s_t)}_{= 0} \\right) \\right]\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $A^{1}(s_t, a_t, b_t)$ is the advantage of the first agent, and $\\pi^2$ is constant w.r.t. $\\theta_1$. LOQA approximates the opponent's policy using Equation \\ref{eqn:pi_approx}. This approximated policy is differentiable with respect to agent parameters since it is computed based on the opponent’s action-value, which is also differentiable (see Equation \\ref{fact:dif}). Consequently, a second term emerges in LOQA's update\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\nabla_{\\theta^1} V^{1}(\\mu) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\text{Pr}_{\\mu}^{\\pi^1, \\pi^2}} \\left[\\sum_{t=0}^T A^{1}(s_t, a_t, b_t)\\nabla_{\\theta^1}\\left(\\text{log }\\pi^1(a_t | s_t) + \\text{log }\\hat{\\pi}^2(b_t | s_t) \\right) \\right]\n\\end{equation}\nThe first log term comes from the Actor-Critic update and the second log term is a shaping component that pushes the opponent's return in a beneficial direction for the agent (in policy space). This second term comes from the assumption that the opponent's policy can be influenced by the agent's parameters.  \n\nIn practice we use DiCE \\citep{Foerster2018b} and loaded-DiCE \\citep{Farquhar2019} on the action-value estimate $\\hat{Q}^2$ to compute the gradient $\\nabla_{\\theta^1} \\text{log }\\hat{\\pi}^2$ and reduce its variance.

We also maintain a replay buffer and, for each optimization step (which requires generating environment rollouts), we sample uniformly from previously encountered agents. This increases the diversity of the opponents the agent faces in the training. The replay buffer has a certain capacity and receives a new agent every $n$th iteration where $n$ is a hyperparameter. \n"

                "\nWe consider two general-sum environments to evaluate LOQA against the current state-of-the-art, namely, the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) and the Coin Game. We compare with POLA and M-FOS, the only methods to the best of our knowledge that generate reciprocity-based cooperative policies in the Coin Game. \n\n\\subsection{Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma}\n\nWe train an agent consisting of a sigmoid over logits for each possible state in the one-step history IPD. There are 5 possible states in this configuration, namely START (the starting state), CC, CD, DC and DD where C stands for cooperation and D stands for defection. The training is done for 4500 iterations (approximately 15 minutes on an Nvidia A100 gpu) using a batch size of 2048. We empirically observe that a LOQA agent is able to reach a tit-for-tat like policy as shown by looking at the probability of cooperation at each state. We believe that the probabilities are not fully saturated for two reasons. First, the normalization over the action-values in the opponent's policy approximation makes it numerically impossible to reach a probability of one for either action. Second, we observed that after some time the trajectories become homogeneous \"always cooperate\" trajectories that ultimately degenerate the quality of the resulting policy by making it less likely to retaliate after a defection by the opponent. \n\n\\begin{figure}%[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=17em]{figures/ipd_exp.pdf}\n  \\caption{Probability of cooperation of a sigmoid LOQA agent at each possible state in the one-step history IPD after 7000 training iterations. LOQA agents' resulting policy is similar to tit-for-tat, a policy that cooperates at the first step and copies the previous action of the opponent at subsequent time-steps.}\n  \\label{fig:league_result}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Coin Game}\n\nLike \\citep{Zhao2022}, we use a GRU policy that has access to the current observation of the game plus both agents' actions in the previous turn to train a LOQA agent in the Coin Game. We run trajectories of length 50 with a discount factor $\\gamma=0.7$ in parallel with a batch size of 8192. For evaluation we run 10 seeds of fully trained agents for 50 episodes in a league that involves other agents and plot the time-averaged reward. The results are shown in Figure \\ref{fig:league_result}. We also experimented with ablations of LOQA that either removed self-play during training or removed the replay buffer of past policy weights to train against. These two ablations showed that these two elements, although not essential, improve the performance of LOQA agents in the Coin Game by making them more cooperative with themselves and less exploitable by always-defect agents.\n\nIn Figure \\ref{fig:league_result}, we observe that LOQA agents are able to cooperate with themselves as indicated by the high average reward of 0.3 which is close to the 0.35 of an always cooperate agent against itself. LOQA agents are able to achieve high social welfare without being exploited by an always defect agent as they achieve an average reward of -0.05, which is comparable to POLA's own -0.03. More importantly our agents are fully trained after only 2 hours of compute time in an Nvidia A100 gpu, compared to the 8 hours of training it takes POLA to achieve the results shown in Figure \\ref{fig:league_result}. It should be noted that as compared to IPD, in the Coin Game, cooperation and defection consist of sequences of actions, therefore an agent must learn to take coins before learning whether they should cooperate with their opponent or not. We also consider full histories as opposed to one-step, making the state space significantly larger.\n\n\\begin{figure}%[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=25em]{figures/league_result.pdf}\n  \\caption{Average rewards after evaluating 10 fully trained LOQA, POLA, and M-FOS seeds against different agents in a 3x3 sized Coin Game lasting 50 episodes.

LOQA is able to generate a policy that demonstrates reciprocity-based cooperation.\n  }\n  \\label{fig:league_result}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Scalability Experiments}\nIn this section, we test LOQA, POLA, and M-FOS on larger grid sizes in the Coin Game to evaluate their scalability. As grid size increases, the average distance between the agents and the coin also grows This added complexity challenges the learning of reciprocal cooperative behavior. For example, when the opponent takes the agent’s coin, the agent must learn to take multiple steps to retaliate. This behavior is less likely to be discovered by random actions on larger grids. Our experiments with different grid sizes illustrate LOQA's scalability properties compared to POLA and M-FOS. \n\nIn assessing the performance of the agents, we consider two metrics: the achievement of a predetermined performance threshold and the time taken to reach this threshold. For the latter, it is critical to acknowledge that the conceptualization of a 'step' differs between POLA and LOQA. The steps in POLA encompass numerous inner optimization steps, rendering a direct comparison of performance per step inconclusive. To facilitate an equitable comparison, we employ the wall clock time of both algorithms, executed under identical computational configurations (GPU, memory, etc.).\n\nThe thresholds are defined based on two principal criteria pertaining to a reciprocity-based cooperative policy. Firstly, we evaluate the agent's return against an “Always Defect” opponent; this serves to test the cessation of cooperation following a lack of reciprocation from the opponent. Secondly, we consider the agents’ return against each other, which serves as a measure of cooperative behavior. This dual-threshold approach is pragmatic as it discerns the distinctive behaviors;\nan ‘Always Defect’ agent meets the first threshold but fails the second, whereas an ‘Always Cooperate’ agent satisfies the second but not the first. However, a policy resembling ‘Tit-for-Tat’ satisfies both thresholds. Furthermore, as the grid size grows the average returns of agents per step decrease  since it takes longer to reach the coin. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure our thresholds are consistent when evaluating for different grid sizes.\n\nWe normalize the returns to make our thresholds standard over all grid sizes. Specifically, we multiply the return by the maximum distance possible between the agent and the coin for a given grid size. Since the grid is wrapped, the normalization value $N$ is given by the Manhattan distance between the center of the grid and one of the corners. We call this the normalized return and we calculate our thresholds based on it. We have three thresholds for our evaluation. The weak and medium thresholds are designed so that all the algorithms are able to reach them. However, as LOQA reaches much higher return on large grid sizes as compared to POLA and M-FOS, we set the strong threshold to a high performance. The specification of the thresholds values is shown in Table \\ref{tab:thresholds}.\n\\begin{table}%[h]\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n    \\toprule\n    Threshold & Normalized Return against Each Other & Normalized Return against Always Defect \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    Weak & $\\geq$0.05 & $\\geq$-1.2 \\\\\n    Medium & $\\geq$0.1 & $\\geq$-0.5\\\\\n    Strong & $\\geq$0.2 & $\\geq$-0.2 \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{Thresholds based on two main criteria of a reciprocity-based cooperative policy.

Each data point indicates the first time its corresponding seed passed a certain threshold. The wall clock time is measured in seconds. Red triangles indicate LOQA's performance while blue circles visualize LOQA's performance. Dashed lines pass through the average time for runs that passed for their respective algorithm.}\n  \\label{fig:walltime_vs_gridsize}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe results of our experiments on larger grid sizes are illustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:walltime_vs_gridsize}.  All LOQA runs meet the strong threshold for grid sizes up to 6, but at a grid size of 7, one run falls short of the strong threshold. In contrast, every POLA and M-FOS run fail to reach the strong threshold for grid sizes above 3. Figure \\ref{fig:thresholds_on_7x7} also provides the evaluation metrics for each algorithm, detailing their behaviors. Additionally, LOQA consistently achieves each threshold substantially faster, by at least one order of magnitude because of its lower time and memory complexity.\n\nThe complexity of LOQA is equivalent to the calculation of a REINFORCE estimator, as is standard in RL. Unlike POLA, LOQA does not involve calculations for opponent optimization steps nor does it differentiate through a computational graph of said optimizations during each training step, giving LOQA greater computationoal efficiency compared to  POLA. Additionally, the absence of a second-order gradient in LOQA reduces the variance of its gradient estimators.\n\nThe model of opponent learning in POLA is restricted to a limited number of optimization steps. In scenarios with increased complexity and varying opponent policies, additional steps may be necessary to accurately represent the opponent's learning. This increase necessitates extended runtimes and increased memory allocation for storing the computational graphs required for differentiation, positioning LOQA as more efficient and economical in memory usage. \n\n\\begin{figure}%[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/training_curves7LOQA-IPD-POLA-M-FOS.pdf}\n  \\caption{Training curves for 3 seeds of POLA, LOQA, and M-FOS on the two evaluation metrics for a 7x7 grid size: Normalized return vs. themselves (Self) and vs. always defect (AD).

                "\nIn this paper we have introduced LOQA, a decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm that is able to learn reciprocity-based cooperation in general sum environments at a lower computational cost than its predecessors. To do so, LOQA agents rely on the observation that their opponent's action-value function is controllable, and the assumption that their opponent's policy closely mirrors it. As a result, LOQA agents are able to shape other LOQA agents by performing REINFORCE updates that can be efficiently computed in hindsight after collecting environment trajectories. This is especially advantageous as demonstrated in the experimental setup, where LOQA agents confidently outperform POLA and M-FOS agents in terms of optimality and efficiency in the Coin Game. Therefore, LOQA stands out as a promising algorithm for tackling more complex and empirically-grounded social dilemmas.\n\n"

Despite the ubiquitous relevance of such settings, decentralized machine learning algorithms have struggled to find equilibria that maximize individual utility while preserving social welfare. Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often fail to converge to desirable solutions due to the non-stationary nature of the environment, where the outcome of each agent is determined not only by their own actions but also by those of other players. In the context of general-sum games, independent RL agents often converge to sub-optimal solutions in the Pareto sense when each seeks to optimize their own utility. This situation draws parallels with many real-world scenarios where individuals pursuing their own selfish interests lead them to a worse outcome than cooperating with others. Thus, one of the objectives of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) research must be to develop decentralized agents that are able to cooperate while avoiding being exploited in partially competitive settings. Previous work has resulted in algorithms that train reciprocity-based cooperative agents by differentiating through the opponent's learning step or by modeling opponent shaping as a meta-game in the space of agent policies. However, both of these approaches have important drawbacks with respect to computational efficiency. Differentiating through even just a few of the opponent’s learning steps can only be done sequentially and requires building large computation graphs, which is computationally costly when dealing with complex opponent policies. Meta-learning defines the problem as a meta-state over the product space of policies of the agent and opponent and learns a meta-policy that maps from the meta-state to the agent's updated policy. The complexity of the problem then scales with the policy parameterization, which is usually a neural network with many parameters. Therefore, there is a need for a more computationally efficient approach that can optimize an agent's individual utility while fostering cooperation among adversaries in partially competitive environments.\",\n  \"main_idea\": \"The paper introduces Learning with Opponent Q-Learning Awareness (LOQA), a novel, decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm tailored to optimizing an agent's individual utility while fostering cooperation among adversaries in partially competitive environments.

In these formulations, finding an optimal decision policy involves computing a certain “value function” which assigns to each state the optimal reward one would obtain if the system was started from that state. This function then naturally prescribes the optimal policy, which is to take decisions that drive the system to states with maximum value. \nFor many practical problems, the computation of the exact value function is intractable, analytically and numerically, due to the enormous size of the state space. Therefore one has to resort to one of the following approximation methods to find a good sub-optimal policy: (1) Approximate the value function. (2) Restrict the search for a good policy to a smaller family of policies. \nIn this thesis, we propose and study actor-critic algorithms which combine the above two approaches with simulation to find the best policy among a parameterized class of policies. Actor-critic algorithms have two learning units: an actor and a critic. An actor is a decision maker with a tunable parameter. A critic is a function approximator. The critic tries to approximate the value function of the policy used by the actor, and the actor in turn tries to improve its policy based on the current approximation provided by the critic. Furthermore, the critic evolves on a faster time-scale than the actor. \nWe propose several variants of actor-critic algorithms. In all the variants, the critic uses Temporal Difference (TD) learning with linear function approximation. Some of the variants are inspired by a new geometric interpretation of the formula for the gradient of the overall reward with respect to the actor parameters. This interpretation suggests a natural set of basis functions for the critic, determined by the family of policies parameterized by the actor's parameters. We concentrate on the average expected reward criterion but we also show how the algorithms can be modified for other objective criteria. We prove convergence of the algorithms for problems with general (finite, countable, or continuous) state and decision spaces. \nTo compute the rate of convergence (ROC) of our algorithms, we develop a general theory of the ROC of two-time-scale algorithms and we apply it to study our algorithms. In the process, we study the ROC of TD learning and compare it with related methods such as Least Squares TD (LSTD). We study the effect of the basis functions used for linear function approximation on the ROC of TD. We also show that the ROC of actor-critic algorithms does not depend on the actual basis functions used in the critic but depends only on the subspace spanned by them and study this dependence. \nFinally, we compare the performance of our algorithms with other algorithms that optimize over a parameterized family of policies. We show that when only the “natural” basis functions are used for the critic, the rate of convergence of the actor critic algorithms is the same as that of certain stochastic gradient descent algorithms. However, with appropriate additional basis functions for the critic, we show that our algorithms outperform the existing ones in terms of ROC.

Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.\n@misc{Schulman2017,\ntitle={Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms}, \nauthor={John Schulman and Filip Wolski and Prafulla Dhariwal and Alec Radford and Oleg Klimov},\nyear={2017},\neprint={1707.06347},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.LG}\n}\n\nAbstract: Social dilemmas are situations where individuals face a temptation to increase their payoffs at a cost to total welfare. Building artificially intelligent agents that achieve good outcomes in these situations is important because many real world interactions include a tension between selfish interests and the welfare of others. We show how to modify modern reinforcement learning methods to construct agents that act in ways that are simple to understand, nice (begin by cooperating), provokable (try to avoid being exploited), and forgiving (try to return to mutual cooperation). We show both theoretically and experimentally that such agents can maintain cooperation in Markov social dilemmas. Our construction does not require training methods beyond a modification of self-play, thus if an environment is such that good strategies can be constructed in the zero-sum case (eg. Atari) then we can construct agents that solve social dilemmas in this environment.\n@misc{Lerer2018,\ntitle={Maintaining cooperation in complex social dilemmas using deep reinforcement learning}, \nauthor={Adam Lerer and Alexander Peysakhovich},\nyear={2018},\neprint={1707.01068},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.AI}\n}\n\nAbstract: Ability to continuously learn and adapt from limited experience in nonstationary environments is an important milestone on the path towards general intelligence.

Additionally, we design a new multi-agent competitive environment, RoboSumo, and define iterated adaptation games for testing various aspects of continuous adaptation strategies. We demonstrate that meta-learning enables significantly more efficient adaptation than reactive baselines in the few-shot regime.

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.\n@misc{Haarnoja2018,\ntitle={Soft Actor-Critic: Off-Policy Maximum Entropy Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Stochastic Actor}, \nauthor={Tuomas Haarnoja and Aurick Zhou and Pieter Abbeel and Sergey Levine},\nyear={2018},\neprint={1801.01290},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.LG}\n}\n\nAbstract: Multi-agent settings are quickly gathering importance in machine learning. This includes a plethora of recent work on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, but also can be extended to hierarchical RL, generative adversarial networks and decentralised optimisation. In all these settings the presence of multiple learning agents renders the training problem non-stationary and often leads to unstable training or undesired final results. We present Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA), a method in which each agent shapes the anticipated learning of the other agents in the environment. The LOLA learning rule includes a term that accounts for the impact of one agent's policy on the anticipated parameter update of the other agents. Results show that the encounter of two LOLA agents leads to the emergence of tit-for-tat and therefore cooperation in the iterated prisoners' dilemma, while independent learning does not. In this domain, LOLA also receives higher payouts compared to a naive learner, and is robust against exploitation by higher order gradient-based methods. Applied to repeated matching pennies, LOLA agents converge to the Nash equilibrium. In a round robin tournament we show that LOLA agents successfully shape the learning of a range of multi-agent learning algorithms from literature, resulting in the highest average returns on the IPD. We also show that the LOLA update rule can be efficiently calculated using an extension of the policy gradient estimator, making the method suitable for model-free RL. The method thus scales to large parameter and input spaces and nonlinear function approximators. We apply LOLA to a grid world task with an embedded social dilemma using recurrent policies and opponent modelling. By explicitly considering the learning of the other agent, LOLA agents learn to cooperate out of self-interest.

While deriving the first-order gradient estimators by differentiating a surrogate loss (SL) objective is computationally and conceptually simple, using the same approach for higher-order gradients is more challenging. Firstly, analytically deriving and implementing such estimators is laborious and not compliant with automatic differentiation. Secondly, repeatedly applying SL to construct new objectives for each order gradient involves increasingly cumbersome graph manipulations. Lastly, to match the first-order gradient under differentiation, SL treats part of the cost as a fixed sample, which we show leads to missing and wrong terms for higher-order gradient estimators. To address all these shortcomings in a unified way, we introduce DiCE, which provides a single objective that can be differentiated repeatedly, generating correct gradient estimators of any order in SCGs. Unlike SL, DiCE relies on automatic differentiation for performing the requisite graph manipulations. We verify the correctness of DiCE both through a proof and through numerical evaluation of the DiCE gradient estimates. We also use DiCE to propose and evaluate a novel approach for multi-agent learning.

Our objective is compatible with arbitrary advantage estimators, which allows the control of the bias and variance of any-order derivatives when using function approximation. Furthermore, we propose a method to trade off bias and variance of higher order derivatives by discounting the impact of more distant causal dependencies. We demonstrate the correctness and utility of our estimator in analytically tractable MDPs and in meta-reinforcement-learning for continuous control.\n@misc{Farquhar2019,\ntitle={Loaded DiCE: Trading off Bias and Variance in Any-Order Score Function Estimators for Reinforcement Learning}, \nauthor={Gregory Farquhar and Shimon Whiteson and Jakob Foerster},\nyear={2019},\neprint={1909.10549},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.LG}\n}\n\nAbstract: A growing number of learning methods are actually differentiable games whose players optimise multiple, interdependent objectives in parallel -- from GANs and intrinsic curiosity to multi-agent RL. Opponent shaping is a powerful approach to improve learning dynamics in these games, accounting for player influence on others' updates. Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness (LOLA) is a recent algorithm that exploits this response and leads to cooperation in settings like the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. Although experimentally successful, we show that LOLA agents can exhibit 'arrogant' behaviour directly at odds with convergence. In fact, remarkably few algorithms have theoretical guarantees applying across all (n-player, non-convex) games. In this paper we present Stable Opponent Shaping (SOS), a new method that interpolates between LOLA and a stable variant named LookAhead. We prove that LookAhead converges locally to equilibria and avoids strict saddles in all differentiable games. SOS inherits these essential guarantees, while also shaping the learning of opponents and consistently either matching or outperforming LOLA experimentally.\n@misc{Letcher2021,\ntitle={Stable Opponent Shaping in Differentiable Games}, \nauthor={Alistair Letcher and Jakob Foerster and David Balduzzi and Tim Rocktäschel and Shimon Whiteson},\nyear={2021},\neprint={1811.08469},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.MA}\n}\n\nAbstract: A fundamental challenge in multiagent reinforcement learning is to learn beneficial behaviors in a shared environment with other agents that are also simultaneously learning. In particular, each agent perceives the environment as effectively non-stationary due to the changing policies of other agents. Moreover, each agent is itself constantly learning, leading to natural nonstationarity in the distribution of experiences encountered. In this paper, we propose a novel meta-multiagent policy gradient theorem that directly accommodates for the non-stationary policy dynamics inherent to these multiagent settings. This is achieved by modeling our gradient updates to directly consider both an agent's own non-stationary policy dynamics and the non-stationary policy dynamics of other agents interacting with it in the environment. We find that our theoretically grounded approach provides a general solution to the multiagent learning problem, which inherently combines key aspects of previous state of the art approaches on this topic. We test our method on several multiagent benchmarks and demonstrate a more efficient ability to adapt to new agents as they learn than previous related approaches across the spectrum of mixed incentive, competitive, and cooperative environments.\n@misc{Kim2021,\ntitle={A Policy Gradient Algorithm for Learning to Learn in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning}, \nauthor={Dong-Ki Kim and Miao Liu and Matthew Riemer and Chuangchuang Sun and Marwa Abdulhai and Golnaz Habibi and Sebastian Lopez-Cot and Gerald Tesauro and Jonathan P.

LOLA (arXiv:1709.04326) accounts for this by differentiating through one step of optimization. We propose to judge joint policies by their long-term prospects as measured by the meta-value, a discounted sum over the returns of future optimization iterates. We apply a form of Q-learning to the meta-game of optimization, in a way that avoids the need to explicitly represent the continuous action space of policy updates. The resulting method, MeVa, is consistent and far-sighted, and does not require REINFORCE estimators. We analyze the behavior of our method on a toy game and compare to prior work on repeated matrix games.\n@misc{Cooijmans2023,\ntitle={Meta-Value Learning: a General Framework for Learning with Learning Awareness}, \nauthor={Tim Cooijmans and Milad Aghajohari and Aaron Courville},\nyear={2023},\nprint={2307.08863},\narchivePrefix={arXiv},\nprimaryClass={cs.LG}\n}\n\nAbstract: We investigate the challenge of multi-agent deep reinforcement learning in partially competitive environments, where traditional methods struggle to foster reciprocity-based cooperation. LOLA and POLA agents learn reciprocity-based cooperative policies by differentiation through a few look-ahead optimization steps of their opponent. However, there is a key limitation in these techniques. Because they consider a few optimization steps, a learning opponent that takes many steps to optimize its return may exploit them. In response, we introduce a novel approach, Best Response Shaping (BRS), which differentiates through an opponent approximating the best response, termed the\"detective.\"To condition the detective on the agent's policy for complex games we propose a state-aware differentiable conditioning mechanism, facilitated by a question answering (QA) method that extracts a representation of the agent based on its behaviour on specific environment states. To empirically validate our method, we showcase its enhanced performance against a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) opponent, which serves as an approximation to the best response in the Coin Game. This work expands the applicability of multi-agent RL in partially competitive environments and provides a new pathway towards achieving improved social welfare in general sum games.\n@article{aghajohari2024best,\n  title={Best Response Shaping},\n  author={Aghajohari, Milad and Cooijmans, Tim and Duque, Juan Agustin and Akatsuka, Shunichi and Courville, Aaron},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.06519},\n  year={2024}\n}The above content represents the relevant literature in this field.

This difficulty often results in the failure of traditional algorithms converging to desirable solutions. In the context of general-sum games, independent RL agents often converge to sub-optimal solutions in the Pareto sense, when each of them seeks to optimize their own utility \\cite{Foerster2018a}. This situation draws parallels with many real-world scenarios, in which individuals pursuing their own selfish interests leads them to a worse outcome than cooperating with others. Thus one of the objectives of MARL research must be to develop decentralized agents that are able to cooperate while avoiding being exploited in partially competitive settings. We call this reciprocity-based cooperation.\n\nPrevious work has resulted in algorithms that train reciprocity-based cooperative agents by differentiating through the opponent's learning step \\citep{Foerster2018a, Letcher2021, Zhao2022, Willi2022} or by modeling opponent shaping as a meta-game in the space of agent policies \\citep{Alshedivat2018, Kim2021, Lu2022, Cooijmans2023}. However, both of these approaches have important drawbacks with respect to computational efficiency. On one hand, differentiating through even just a few of the opponent’s learning steps, can only be done sequentially and requires building large computation graphs. This is computationally costly when dealing with complex opponent policies. On the other hand, meta-learning  defines the problem as a meta-state over the product space of policies of the agent and opponent, and learns a meta-policy that maps from the meta-state to the agent's updated policy. The complexity of the problem then scales with the policy parameterization which is usually a neural network with many parameters.\n\nIn this paper we introduce Learning with Opponent Q-Learning Awareness (LOQA), which stands because it avoids computing gradients w.r.t. optimization steps or learning the dynamics of a meta-game, resulting in significantly improved computational efficiency. LOQA performs opponent shaping by assuming that the opponent's behavior is guided by an internal action-value function $Q$. This assumption allows LOQA agents to build a model of the opponent policy that can be shaped by influencing its returns for different actions. Controlling the return by differentiating through stochastic objectives is a key idea in RL and can be done using the REINFORCE estimator \\cite{Williams1992}. LOQA is strongly inspired by Best Response Shaping \\cite{aghajohari2024best}. In BRS, the detective approximates the optimal response to an agent by conditioning on the returns from simulated game trajectories between the agent and a random opponent. The agent then differentiates through the detective through these differentiable returns. \n\n\n\\section{Background}\n\n\n\nWe consider general-sum, $n$-player, Markov games, also referred as stochastic games \\cite{Shapley1953}. Markov games are defined by a tuple $\\mathcal{M} = (N, \\mathcal{S}, \\mathcal{A}, P, \\mathcal{R}, \\gamma)$ where $\\mathcal{S}$ denotes the state space, $\\mathcal{A} := \\mathcal{A}^1 \\times \\hdots \\times \\mathcal{A}^n$, is the joint action space of all players, $P:\\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\to \\Delta(\\mathcal{S})$, defines a mapping from every state and joint action to a probability distribution over states, $\\mathcal{R} = \\{r^1, \\hdots, r^n\\}$ is the set of reward functions where each $r^i: \\mathcal{S} \\times \\mathcal{A} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ maps every state and joint action to a scalar return and $\\gamma \\in [0,1]$ is the discount factor.\n\nWe use the notation and definitions for standard RL algorithms of \\cite{Agarwal2021}. Consider two agents, 1 (agent) and 2 (opponent) that interact in an environment with neural network policies $\\pi^1 := \\pi(\\cdot|\\cdot ;\\theta^1)$, $\\pi^2 := \\pi(\\cdot|\\cdot ;\\theta^2)$ parameterized by $\\theta^1$ and $\\theta^2$ respectively. We denote $\\tau$ to be a trajectory with initial state distribution $\\mu$ and probability measure $\\text{Pr}_{\\mu}^{\\pi^1, \\pi^2}$ given by\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\text{Pr}_{\\mu}^{\\pi^1, \\pi^2}(\\tau) = \\mu(s_0) \\pi^1(a_0 | s_0) \\pi^2(b_0 | s_0) P(s_1 | s_0, a_0, b_0)\\hdots\n\\end{align*}\nhere $b \\in \\mathcal{A}^2$ denotes the action of the opponent. In multi-agent reinforcement learning, each agent seeks to optimize their expected discounted return $R$, for the agent this is given by:\n\\begin{align*}\n    V^{1}(\\mu) := \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\text{Pr}_{\\mu}^{\\pi^1, \\pi^2}} \\left[ R^1(\\tau) \\right]  = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\text{Pr}_{\\mu}^{\\pi^1, \\pi^2}} \\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\gamma^t r^1(s_t, a_t, b_t) \\right]\n\\end{align*}\nThe key observation is that under the definitions above, $V^1$ is dependent on the policy of the opponent through the reward function $r^1(s_t, a_t, b_t)$. $V^1$ is thus\ndifferentiable with respect to the parameters of the opponent via the REINFORCE estimator \\citep{Williams1992}\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\begin{split}\n    \\label{fact:dif}\n    \\nabla_{\\theta^2} V^{1}(\\mu) &= \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\text{Pr}_{\\mu}^{\\pi^1, \\pi^2}} \\left[R^1(\\tau) \\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\nabla_{\\theta^2} \\text{log } \\pi^2(b_t | s_t) \\right]\\\\\n    &= \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\text{Pr}_{\\mu}^{\\pi^1, \\pi^2}} \\left[\\sum_{t=0}^\\infty \\gamma^{t} r^1(s_t, a_t, b_t) \\sum_{k < t} \\nabla_{\\theta^2} \\text{log }\\pi^2(b_k | s_k)\\right]\n    \\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\nwe will rely on this observation to influence the opponent's $Q$ value and incentivize reciprocity-based cooperation in partially competitive environments.\n\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\n\\subsection{Opponent Shaping}\n\nLearning with opponent learning awareness (LOLA), \\citep{Foerster2018a} introduces the concept of opponent shaping, i.e. the idea of steering the other agent throughout its learning process. LOLA assumes that the opponent is a naive learner and attempts to shape it by considering one step in its optimization process. Rather than optimizing the value under the current policies at the current iteration $i$, $V^1(\\theta_i^1, \\: \\theta_i^2)$, LOLA optimizes $V^1(\\theta_i^1, \\: \\theta_i^2 + \\Delta \\theta_i^2)$ where $\\Delta \\theta_i^2$ is a learning step of the opponent. $\\Delta \\theta_i^2$ is as a function that depends on the agent's parameters and that is thus differentiable with respect to $\\theta^1$. Since the derivative of function $V^1(\\theta_i^1, \\: \\theta_i^2 + \\Delta \\theta_i^2)$ is difficult to compute, the authors consider the surrogate value given by its first order Taylor expansion. POLA, \\citep{Zhao2022} builds an idealized version LOLA that, unlike its predecessor, is invariant to the parameterization of the policy. In a similar fashion to proximal policy optimization (PPO) \\citep{Schulman2017}, each agent increases the probability of actions that increase their expected return, while trying to minimize the $l_2$ distance between the updated policy and the old policy. This combined objective of maximizing the return and minimizing the $l_2$ distance in policy space is equivalent to the Proximal Point method, hence the name Proximal-LOLA or POLA. Other modifications to the original LOLA algorithm attempt to resolve its shortcomings. Consistent learning with opponent learning awareness (COLA), \\citep{Willi2022} attempts to resolve the inherent inconsistency of LOLA assuming that the other agent is a naive learner instead of another LOLA agent. Stable opponent shaping (SOS), \\citep{Letcher2021} introduces an interpolation between LOLA and a more stable variant called \\emph{look ahead}, which has strong theoretical convergence guarantees.\n\n\\subsection{Meta Learning}\n\nOther methods have been used to generate agents that have near optimal behavior in social dilemmas. First used by \\cite{Alshedivat2018} for this setting, meta learning redefines the MARL problem as a meta-game in the space of policy parameters in an attempt to deal with the non-stationary nature of the environment.\nIn this meta-game, the meta-state is the joint policy, the meta-reward is the return on the underlying game, and a meta-action is a change to the inner policy (i.e. the policy in the original game).\nModel free opponent shaping (M-FOS) \\citep{Lu2022} applies policy gradient methods to this meta-game to find a strong meta-policy.\nMeta-Value Learning \\citep{Cooijmans2023} applies value learning to model the long-term effects of policy changes, and uses the gradient of the value as an improvement direction. \n\n\n\n\\section{Social Dilemmas}\n\n\nSocial dilemmas are a type of decision problem where each party's miopic efforts to maximize their own benefit lead to a less favorable outcome compared to when all parties cooperate. Designed primarily as thought experiments, these dilemmas demonstrate the trade-offs that are often inherent in multi-agent decision-making scenarios. As such, they have been used to model real-life situations in diverse fields such as economics, ecology and policy making. One example of such a decision problem is the famous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD).\n\n\\paragraph{The Prisoner's Dilemma (PD)}\nPD is a game in which each of the two agents or prisoners must decide to either cooperate with one another or defect. The dilemma the prisoners face originates from the reward structure, given in Table \\ref{tab:PD}. With with reward structure, a rational agent will choose to defect no matter what the other agent chooses. As a result, both agents become locked in the defect-defect Nash equilibrium, even though they would achieve greater utility by both choosing to cooperate. \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\centering\n\\begin{tabular}{c|cc}\n\\diagbox{Agent}{Opponent} & Cooperate & Defect \\\\\n\\hline\nCooperate &  $(-1,-1)$ & $(-3,\\phantom{+}0)$ \\\\\nDefect &  $(\\phantom{+}0,-3)$ & $(-2,-2)$ \\\\\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{Payoff (or reward) matrix for the Prisoner's Dilemma game, where the numbered pairs corresponds to the payoffs of the Agent and the Opponent respectively.}\n    \\label{tab:PD}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\paragraph{Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD)}\nAs the name implies IPD is simply an (infinitely) repeated version of the Prisoner's Dilemma. Unlike standard PD, IPD offers some hope for rational cooperative behaviour. Originally popularized by \\cite{Axelrod1980}, the IPD has been used to model many hypothetical and real-world scenarios. It has also become a popular test-bed for MARL algorithms attempting to achieve reciprocity based cooperation policies. A simple but effective strategy in the IPD is \\emph{tit-for-tat} (TFT), which consists in cooperating at the first turn and copying the opponent's action thereafter. \n\n\\paragraph{The Coin Game}\nInitially described in \\citep{Lerer2018}, the Coin Game is a grid world environment in which two agents take turns taking coins. At the beginning of each episode a coin of a particular color (red or blue), corresponding to that of one of the two agents, spawns at a random location in the grid. Agents are rewarded for any coin taken, but are punished if the other agent takes the coin corresponding to their color. The reward structure of the Coin Game is designed to incentivize cooperation between agents, as each one would be better off if both take only the coin corresponding to their color. In such way the Coin Game mirrors the IPD, therefore policies that \\emph{cooperate reciprocally} are highly desirable as they achieve better individual and social outcomes. However unlike IPD, the Coin Game is embedded in a non-trivial environment and requires non-trivial policy models. It can be seen as an extension of IPD towards more complex and realistic scenarios. \n\n\n\n\\section{Method Description}\n\n\nIntuitively, a change in either the agent’s or the opponent’s policy results in a change in the probability measure over the trajectories that are observed when both of them interact in an environment. Since the value function of the \\emph{opponent} is an expectation over said probability measure, it is controllable by the \\emph{agent’s} policy (and vice versa). LOQA leverages this observation to exert influence over the policy that the opponent will learn. \n\nAs an illustration, consider an instance of the IPD game where a LOQA agent and the opponent are initialized to be random agents, i.e. they samples actions from a uniform distribution. If the LOQA agent  increases its probability of defection after the opponent defects, it implicitly decreases the action-value function of the opponent for defecting. The opponent will then learn this and reduce its probability of defecting. Similarly, if the LOQA agent cooperates after the opponent cooperates, it increases the action-value of cooperation for the opponent. In response, the opponent will learn to cooperate more. This reciprocity-based cooperative behavior is the structure behind tit-for-tat.\n\n\\subsection{Modeling the Opponent's Policy}\n\nLet $\\pi^1(b | s) := \\pi(b | s; \\theta^1)$ refer to the policy of the agent and $\\pi^2(b | s) := \\pi(b | s; \\theta^2)$ refer to the policy of the opponent, which are neural networks with parameters $\\theta^1$ and $\\theta^2$. Similarly, $Q^2(s, b) := Q(s, b;\\phi^2)$ denotes the action-value function of the opponent, which is a neural network with parameters $\\phi^2$. \n\nLOQA relies on a key assumption about the opponent's policy. Similar to Soft Actor Critic (SAC) \\citep{Haarnoja2018}, the assumption is that the opponents' actions are sampled from a distribution that is proportional to its action-value function $Q^2(\\cdot)$. More formally, at time $t$, we can write this assumption as\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\pi^2(b_t | s_t) &\\approx \\frac{\\text{exp}(Q^2(s_t, b_t))}{\\sum_{b'} \\text{exp} (Q^2(s_{t}, b'))}\n\\end{align*}\nMore specifically we approximate $Q^2$ with Monte Carlo rollouts $\\mathcal{T}$ of length $T$, where every trajectory $\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}$, $\\tau \\sim \\text{Pr}_{\\mu}^{\\pi^1, \\pi^2}$, starts at state $s_t$ with the opponent taking action $b_t$\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\hat{Q}^2(s_t, b_t) &= \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\mathcal{T}} \\left[R^2(\\tau) | s=s_t, b=b_t\\right] \\\\\n    &= \\frac{1}{|\\mathcal{T}|}\\sum_{\\tau \\in \\mathcal{T}} \\sum_{k=t}^T \\gamma^{k - t} r^2(s_k, a_k, b_k)\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $r^2(s, a, b)$ denotes the opponent's reward at state $s$ after taking action $b$ and the opponent taking action $a$. This empirical expectation of the $Q$ function is controllable by the agent using the reinforce estimator\n\\begin{align*}\n    \\nabla_{\\theta^1} \\hat{Q}^2(s_t, b_t) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\mathcal{T}} \\left[\\sum_{k=t+1}^T \\gamma^{k - t} r^2(s_k, a_k, b_k) \\sum_{t < j < k} \\nabla_{\\theta^1} \\text{log }\\pi^1(a_j | s_j)\\right]\n\\end{align*}\nThe opponent's policy evaluated at state $s_t$ can now be approximated using the Monte Carlo rollout estimate $\\hat{Q}^2$ and the action-value function $Q^2$ as follows\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\label{eqn:pi_approx}\n    \\hat{\\pi}^2(b_t | s_t) := \\frac{\\text{exp}(\\hat{Q}^2(s_t, b_t))}{\\text{exp}(\\hat{Q}^2(s_t, b_t)) + \\sum_{b'\\neq b_t} \\text{exp} (Q^2(s_{t}, b'))}\n\\end{equation}\nNotice that we assume access to the opponent's real action-value function $Q^2$. To have a fully decentralized algorithm we can simply replace $Q^2$ with the agent's own estimate of the opponent's action-value function. We now integrate these ideas into the Actor-Critic formulation. \n\n\\subsection{Opponent Shaping}\n\nIn order to shape the opponent behavior, we factor in the opponent's policy approximation $\\hat{\\pi}^2$ as well as the agent's policy $\\pi^1$ in the probability measure over trajectories. Adapting the original Actor-Critic formulation \\citep{Konda2000} to the joint agent-opponent policy space we have:\n\\begin{align*} \n    \\nabla_{\\theta^1} V^{1}(\\mu) &= \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\text{Pr}_{\\mu}^{\\pi^1, \\pi^2}} \\left[\\sum_{t=0}^T A^{1}(s_t, a_t, b_t)\\nabla_{\\theta^1}\\left(\\text{log }\\pi^1(a_t | s_t) + \\underbrace{\\text{log }\\pi^2(b_t | s_t)}_{= 0} \\right) \\right]\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $A^{1}(s_t, a_t, b_t)$ is the advantage of the first agent, and $\\pi^2$ is constant w.r.t. $\\theta_1$. LOQA approximates the opponent's policy using Equation \\ref{eqn:pi_approx}. This approximated policy is differentiable with respect to agent parameters since it is computed based on the opponent’s action-value, which is also differentiable (see Equation \\ref{fact:dif}). Consequently, a second term emerges in LOQA's update\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\nabla_{\\theta^1} V^{1}(\\mu) = \\mathbb{E}_{\\tau \\sim \\text{Pr}_{\\mu}^{\\pi^1, \\pi^2}} \\left[\\sum_{t=0}^T A^{1}(s_t, a_t, b_t)\\nabla_{\\theta^1}\\left(\\text{log }\\pi^1(a_t | s_t) + \\text{log }\\hat{\\pi}^2(b_t | s_t) \\right) \\right]\n\\end{equation}\nThe first log term comes from the Actor-Critic update and the second log term is a shaping component that pushes the opponent's return in a beneficial direction for the agent (in policy space). This second term comes from the assumption that the opponent's policy can be influenced by the agent's parameters.  \n\nIn practice we use DiCE \\citep{Foerster2018b} and loaded-DiCE \\citep{Farquhar2019} on the action-value estimate $\\hat{Q}^2$ to compute the gradient $\\nabla_{\\theta^1} \\text{log }\\hat{\\pi}^2$ and reduce its variance. Also, the current trajectory $\\tau$ itself is used for $\\hat{Q}^2$ estimation\n\n\\begin{algorithm}[t]%[h]\n\\caption{LOQA}\n\\label{algo:loqa}\n\\begin{algorithmic}\n\\STATE \\textbf{Initialize:} Discount factor $\\gamma$, agent action-value parameters $\\phi^1$, target action-value parameters $\\phi_{\\text{target}}^1$, actor parameters $\\theta^1$, opponent action-value parameters $\\phi^2$, target action-value parameters $\\phi_{\\text{target}}^2$, actor parameters $\\theta^2$\n\\FOR{iteration$=1, 2, \\hdots$}\n    \\STATE Run policies $\\pi^1$ and $\\pi^2$ for $T$ timesteps in environment and collect trajectory $\\tau$\n     \\STATE $L_Q^1 \\gets 0$, $L_Q^2 \\gets 0$\n     \\FOR{$t=1, 2, \\hdots, T-1$}\n         \\STATE $L_Q^1 \\gets L_Q^1 +$ HUBER\\_LOSS$(r_t + \\gamma Q_{\\text{target}}^1(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q^1(s_t, a_t))$\n         \\STATE $L_Q^2 \\gets L_Q^2 +$ HUBER\\_LOSS$(r_t + \\gamma Q_{\\text{target}}^2(s_{t+1}, b_{t+1}) - Q^2(s_t, a_t))$\n     \\ENDFOR\n    \\STATE Optimize $L_Q^1$ w.r.t. $\\phi^1$ and $L_Q^2$ w.r.t. $\\phi^2$\n    with optimizer of choice\n    \\STATE Compute advantage estimates $\\{A_1^1, \\hdots, A_T^1\\}$, $\\{A_1^2, \\hdots, A_T^2\\}$\n    \\STATE $L_a^1 \\gets$ LOQA\\_ACTOR\\_LOSS$(\\tau, \\pi^1, \\gamma, \\{A_1^1, \\hdots, A_T^1\\})$\n    \\STATE $L_a^2 \\gets$ LOQA\\_ACTOR\\_LOSS$(\\tau, \\pi^2, \\gamma, \\{A_1^2, \\hdots, A_T^2\\})$\n    \\STATE Optimize $L_a^1$ w.r.t. $\\theta^1$ and $L_a^2$ w.r.t. $\\theta^2$\n    with optimizer of choice\n\\ENDFOR\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\n\\begin{algorithm}[t]%[h]\n\\caption{LOQA\\_ACTOR\\_LOSS}\n\\label{algo:loqa_reinforce}\n\\begin{algorithmic}\n\\STATE \\textbf{Input:} Trajectory $\\tau$ of length $T$, actor policy $\\pi^i$, opponent action-value function $Q^{-i}$, discount factor $\\gamma$, advantages $\\{A_1^i, \\hdots, A_T^i\\}$\n\\STATE $L_a \\gets 0$\n\\FOR{$t=1, 2, \\hdots, T-1$}\n    \\STATE $\\hat{Q}^{-i}(s_t, b_t) \\gets \\sum_{k=t}^T \\gamma^{k - t} r^{-i}(s_k, a_k, b_k)$ \\hfill $\\triangleright$ $r^{-i}$ made differentiable using DiCE\n    \\STATE Compute $\\hat{\\pi}^{-i}$ using $\\hat{Q}^{-i}(s_t, b_t)$ and $Q^{-i}(s_t, b_t)$ according to equation (\\ref{eqn:pi_approx}) \n    \\STATE $L_a \\gets L_a + A_t^i\\:\\left[\\text{log }\\pi^i(a_t | s_t) + \\text{log }\\hat{\\pi}^{-i}(b_t | s_t)\\right]$\n\\ENDFOR\n\\STATE \\textbf{return:} $L_a$\n\\end{algorithmic}\n\\end{algorithm}\n\n\\subsection{Self Play and Replay Buffer of Previous Agents}\nBecause the environments are symmetric we can use \\emph{self-play} to train a single LOQA agent against itself. We also maintain a replay buffer and, for each optimization step (which requires generating environment rollouts), we sample uniformly from previously encountered agents. This increases the diversity of the opponents the agent faces in the training. The replay buffer has a certain capacity and receives a new agent every $n$th iteration where $n$ is a hyperparameter. \n\n\n```\n\n## Experimental Setup\n\n```json\n[{\"name\": \"Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD)\", \"description\": \"The experiment involves training an agent in the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma (IPD) game using the LOQA algorithm.

We compare with POLA and M-FOS, the only methods to the best of our knowledge that generate reciprocity-based cooperative policies in the Coin Game. \n\n\\subsection{Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma}\n\nWe train an agent consisting of a sigmoid over logits for each possible state in the one-step history IPD. There are 5 possible states in this configuration, namely START (the starting state), CC, CD, DC and DD where C stands for cooperation and D stands for defection. The training is done for 4500 iterations (approximately 15 minutes on an Nvidia A100 gpu) using a batch size of 2048. We empirically observe that a LOQA agent is able to reach a tit-for-tat like policy as shown by looking at the probability of cooperation at each state. We believe that the probabilities are not fully saturated for two reasons. First, the normalization over the action-values in the opponent's policy approximation makes it numerically impossible to reach a probability of one for either action. Second, we observed that after some time the trajectories become homogeneous \"always cooperate\" trajectories that ultimately degenerate the quality of the resulting policy by making it less likely to retaliate after a defection by the opponent. \n\n\\begin{figure}%[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=17em]{figures/ipd_exp.pdf}\n  \\caption{Probability of cooperation of a sigmoid LOQA agent at each possible state in the one-step history IPD after 7000 training iterations. LOQA agents' resulting policy is similar to tit-for-tat, a policy that cooperates at the first step and copies the previous action of the opponent at subsequent time-steps.}\n  \\label{fig:league_result}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Coin Game}\n\nLike \\citep{Zhao2022}, we use a GRU policy that has access to the current observation of the game plus both agents' actions in the previous turn to train a LOQA agent in the Coin Game. We run trajectories of length 50 with a discount factor $\\gamma=0.7$ in parallel with a batch size of 8192. For evaluation we run 10 seeds of fully trained agents for 50 episodes in a league that involves other agents and plot the time-averaged reward. The results are shown in Figure \\ref{fig:league_result}. We also experimented with ablations of LOQA that either removed self-play during training or removed the replay buffer of past policy weights to train against. These two ablations showed that these two elements, although not essential, improve the performance of LOQA agents in the Coin Game by making them more cooperative with themselves and less exploitable by always-defect agents.\n\nIn Figure \\ref{fig:league_result}, we observe that LOQA agents are able to cooperate with themselves as indicated by the high average reward of 0.3 which is close to the 0.35 of an always cooperate agent against itself. LOQA agents are able to achieve high social welfare without being exploited by an always defect agent as they achieve an average reward of -0.05, which is comparable to POLA's own -0.03. More importantly our agents are fully trained after only 2 hours of compute time in an Nvidia A100 gpu, compared to the 8 hours of training it takes POLA to achieve the results shown in Figure \\ref{fig:league_result}. It should be noted that as compared to IPD, in the Coin Game, cooperation and defection consist of sequences of actions, therefore an agent must learn to take coins before learning whether they should cooperate with their opponent or not. We also consider full histories as opposed to one-step, making the state space significantly larger.\n\n\\begin{figure}%[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=25em]{figures/league_result.pdf}\n  \\caption{Average rewards after evaluating 10 fully trained LOQA, POLA, and M-FOS seeds against different agents in a 3x3 sized Coin Game lasting 50 episodes.

LOQA is able to generate a policy that demonstrates reciprocity-based cooperation.\n  }\n  \\label{fig:league_result}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\subsection{Scalability Experiments}\nIn this section, we test LOQA, POLA, and M-FOS on larger grid sizes in the Coin Game to evaluate their scalability. As grid size increases, the average distance between the agents and the coin also grows This added complexity challenges the learning of reciprocal cooperative behavior. For example, when the opponent takes the agent’s coin, the agent must learn to take multiple steps to retaliate. This behavior is less likely to be discovered by random actions on larger grids. Our experiments with different grid sizes illustrate LOQA's scalability properties compared to POLA and M-FOS. \n\nIn assessing the performance of the agents, we consider two metrics: the achievement of a predetermined performance threshold and the time taken to reach this threshold. For the latter, it is critical to acknowledge that the conceptualization of a 'step' differs between POLA and LOQA. The steps in POLA encompass numerous inner optimization steps, rendering a direct comparison of performance per step inconclusive. To facilitate an equitable comparison, we employ the wall clock time of both algorithms, executed under identical computational configurations (GPU, memory, etc.).\n\nThe thresholds are defined based on two principal criteria pertaining to a reciprocity-based cooperative policy. Firstly, we evaluate the agent's return against an “Always Defect” opponent; this serves to test the cessation of cooperation following a lack of reciprocation from the opponent. Secondly, we consider the agents’ return against each other, which serves as a measure of cooperative behavior. This dual-threshold approach is pragmatic as it discerns the distinctive behaviors;\nan ‘Always Defect’ agent meets the first threshold but fails the second, whereas an ‘Always Cooperate’ agent satisfies the second but not the first. However, a policy resembling ‘Tit-for-Tat’ satisfies both thresholds. Furthermore, as the grid size grows the average returns of agents per step decrease  since it takes longer to reach the coin. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure our thresholds are consistent when evaluating for different grid sizes.\n\nWe normalize the returns to make our thresholds standard over all grid sizes. Specifically, we multiply the return by the maximum distance possible between the agent and the coin for a given grid size. Since the grid is wrapped, the normalization value $N$ is given by the Manhattan distance between the center of the grid and one of the corners. We call this the normalized return and we calculate our thresholds based on it. We have three thresholds for our evaluation. The weak and medium thresholds are designed so that all the algorithms are able to reach them. However, as LOQA reaches much higher return on large grid sizes as compared to POLA and M-FOS, we set the strong threshold to a high performance. The specification of the thresholds values is shown in Table \\ref{tab:thresholds}.\n\\begin{table}%[h]\n    \\centering\n    \\begin{tabular}{ccc}\n    \\toprule\n    Threshold & Normalized Return against Each Other & Normalized Return against Always Defect \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    Weak & $\\geq$0.05 & $\\geq$-1.2 \\\\\n    Medium & $\\geq$0.1 & $\\geq$-0.5\\\\\n    Strong & $\\geq$0.2 & $\\geq$-0.2 \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n    \\caption{Thresholds based on two main criteria of a reciprocity-based cooperative policy. The weak and medium thresholds are designed such that all agents pass them, while the strong threshold represents good performance.}\n    \\label{tab:thresholds}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/walltime_vs_gridsize_mfos_included.png}\n  \\caption{Wall clock time vs grid size for three seeds of LOQA, POLA, and M-FOS on reaching different thresholds. Each data point indicates the first time its corresponding seed passed a certain threshold. The wall clock time is measured in seconds. Red triangles indicate LOQA's performance while blue circles visualize LOQA's performance. Dashed lines pass through the average time for runs that passed for their respective algorithm.}\n  \\label{fig:walltime_vs_gridsize}\n\\end{figure}\n\nThe results of our experiments on larger grid sizes are illustrated in Figure \\ref{fig:walltime_vs_gridsize}.  All LOQA runs meet the strong threshold for grid sizes up to 6, but at a grid size of 7, one run falls short of the strong threshold. In contrast, every POLA and M-FOS run fail to reach the strong threshold for grid sizes above 3. Figure \\ref{fig:thresholds_on_7x7} also provides the evaluation metrics for each algorithm, detailing their behaviors. Additionally, LOQA consistently achieves each threshold substantially faster, by at least one order of magnitude because of its lower time and memory complexity.\n\nThe complexity of LOQA is equivalent to the calculation of a REINFORCE estimator, as is standard in RL. Unlike POLA, LOQA does not involve calculations for opponent optimization steps nor does it differentiate through a computational graph of said optimizations during each training step, giving LOQA greater computationoal efficiency compared to  POLA. Additionally, the absence of a second-order gradient in LOQA reduces the variance of its gradient estimators.\n\nThe model of opponent learning in POLA is restricted to a limited number of optimization steps. In scenarios with increased complexity and varying opponent policies, additional steps may be necessary to accurately represent the opponent's learning. This increase necessitates extended runtimes and increased memory allocation for storing the computational graphs required for differentiation, positioning LOQA as more efficient and economical in memory usage. \n\n\\begin{figure}%[htbp]\n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figures/training_curves7LOQA-IPD-POLA-M-FOS.pdf}\n  \\caption{Training curves for 3 seeds of POLA, LOQA, and M-FOS on the two evaluation metrics for a 7x7 grid size: Normalized return vs. themselves (Self) and vs. always defect (AD).  The wall clock time is measured in seconds. Note that the range of the x-axis is different for each algorithm as POLA and M-FOS need more time.}\n  \\label{fig:thresholds_on_7x7}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\section{Limitations}\n\n\nLOQA is primarily limited by the assumption that the other player acts accordingly to an inner action-value function. As such, it is unable to shape other opponents that do not necessarily follow this assumption. In a similar way, LOQA agents are designed for environments with discrete action spaces. Future work could explore relaxations that allow LOQA agents to shape other types of agents and learn in continuous action spaces.\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\n\nIn this paper we have introduced LOQA, a decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm that is able to learn reciprocity-based cooperation in general sum environments at a lower computational cost than its predecessors. To do so, LOQA agents rely on the observation that their opponent's action-value function is controllable, and the assumption that their opponent's policy closely mirrors it. As a result, LOQA agents are able to shape other LOQA agents by performing REINFORCE updates that can be efficiently computed in hindsight after collecting environment trajectories. This is especially advantageous as demonstrated in the experimental setup, where LOQA agents confidently outperform POLA and M-FOS agents in terms of optimality and efficiency in the Coin Game. Therefore, LOQA stands out as a promising algorithm for tackling more complex and empirically-grounded social dilemmas.\n\n\n\n\\section{Acknowledgments}\n\n The authors would like to thank Mila and Compute Canada for providing the computational resources used for this paper.
