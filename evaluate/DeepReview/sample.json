Our method, named \\textbf{\\textsl{MaskComp}}, delineates the completion process through iterative stages of generation and segmentation. \nIn each iteration, the object mask is provided as an additional condition to boost image generation, and, in return, the generated images can lead to a more accurate mask by fusing the segmentation of images.\nWe demonstrate that the combination of one generation and one segmentation stage effectively functions as a mask denoiser. Through alternation between the generation and segmentation stages, the partial object mask is progressively refined, providing precise shape guidance and yielding superior object completion results. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of MaskComp over existing approaches, \\eg, ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, establishing it as an effective solution for object completion.\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\n\\def\\tabdesignchoice#1{\n\\begin{table*}[#1]\n\t\\centering\n \t\\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{Segmentation model}.\n\t\\label{tab:segm model}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.25\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n\t\t\t\t\t\\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n\t\t\t\t\t\\begin{tabular}{l|ccc}\n                        Model & CLIPSeg & SEEM & SAM \\\\ [.1em]\n                        \\shline\n\t\t\t\t\tFID & 19.9 & 18.1 & 16.9\\\\\n                    \\end{tabular}\n\t\t\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n\t}\n\t\\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{IMD step number}.\n\t\\label{tab:step number}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.25\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n    \\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|ccccc}\n        $T$ & 1 & 3 & 5 & 7 \\\\ [.1em]\n        \\shline\n        FID & 24.7 & 19.4 & 16.9 & 16.1  \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n}\n\\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{\\# of sampled images}.\n\t\\label{tab:image number}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\centering\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.25\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n    \\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|ccc}\n        N & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ [.1em]\n        \\shline\n    FID & 17.4 & 16.9 & 16.8 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n\t\t\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n\t}\n    \\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{Condition gating}.\n\t\\label{tab:gating}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.2\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n\t\t\t\t\t\\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n\t\t\t\t\t\\begin{tabular}{l|cccc}\n                        Gating & \\Checkmark & \\XSolidBrush \\\\ [.1em]\n                        \\shline\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFID & 16.9 & 18.2\\\\\n                    \\end{tabular}\n\t\t\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n\t}\n\t\\caption{\\textbf{Design choices for IMD on AHP dataset.} We ablate (a) the impact of different segmentation networks, (b) IMD step number, (c) the number of sampled images in the segmentation stage, and (d) the gating operation in the CompNet.}\n\t\\label{tab:design choices}\n\\end{table*}}\n\\def\\tableablation#1{\n\\begin{table*}[#1]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{Conditioned mask}.\n\t\\label{tab:conditioned mask}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.25\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n    \\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|ccccc}\n        Mask & Partial & Intermed. & Complete \\\\ [.1em]\n        \\shline\n        FID & 16.9 & 15.3 & 12.7   \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n}\n\t\\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{Occlusion rate}.\n\t\\label{tab:occ}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.27\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n\t\t\t\t\t\\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n\t\t\t\t\t\\begin{tabular}{l|cccc}\n                        Occ. & 20\\% & 40 \\% & 60 \\% & 80\\%\\\\ [.1em]\n                        \\shline\n\t\t\t\t\tFID & 13.4 & 15.7 & 17.2 & 29.9\\\\\n                    \\end{tabular}\n\t\t\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n\t}\n \\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{Inference time}.\n\t\\label{tab:time}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\centering\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.2\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n    \\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|ccc}\n        Comp. & Gen. & Segm. & Total \\\\ [.1em]\n        \\shline\n    Second &  14.3 & 1.2 & 15.5 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n\t\t\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n\t}\n  \\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{Amodal baseline}.\n\t\\label{tab:amodal}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\centering\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.25\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n    \\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|ccc}\n        Model & Baseline & MaskComp \\\\ [.1em]\n        \\shline\n    FID & 29.4 & 16.9 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n\t\t\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n\t}\n\t\\caption{\\textbf{Ablation of MaskComp on AHP dataset}.

Recent breakthroughs in image generation techniques have delivered impressive results across various image editing tasks, including image inpainting \\citep{Xie_2023_CVPR}, composition \\citep{yang2023paint} and colorization \\citep{Chang_2023_CVPR}. However, another intriguing challenge lies in the domain of object completion (\\cref{fig:teaser0}). This task involves the restoration of partially occluded objects within an image, representing the image as a layered stack of objects and background, which can potentially enable a number of more complicated editing tasks such as object layer switching. Unlike other conditional generation tasks, \\eg, image inpainting, which only generates and integrates complete objects into images, object completion requires seamless alignment between the generated content and the given partial object, which imposes more challenges to recover realistic and comprehensive object shapes.\n \nTo guide the generative model in producing images according to a specific shape, additional conditions can be incorporated \\citep{Koley_2023_CVPR,Yang_2023_CVPR}. Image segmentation has been shown to be a critical technique for enhancing the realism and stability of generative models by providing pixel-level guidance during the synthesis process. Recent research, as exemplified in the latest study by Zhang et al. \\citep{zhang2023adding}, showcases that, by supplying object segmentations as additional high-quality masks for shaping the objects, it becomes possible to generate complex images of remarkable fidelity.\nIn this paper, we present MaskComp, a novel approach that bridges image generation and segmentation for effective object completion. MaskComp is rooted in a fundamental observation: the quality of the resulting image in the mask-conditioned generation is directly influenced by the quality of the conditioned mask \\citep{zhang2023adding}. That says the more detailed the conditioned mask, the more realistic the generated image. \nBased on this observation, unlike prior object completion methods that solely rely on partially visible objects for generating complete objects, MaskComp introduces an additional mask condition combined with an iterative mask denoising (IMD) process, progressively refining the incomplete mask to provide comprehensive shape guidance to object completion.\n\nOur approach formulates the partial mask as a noisy form of the complete mask and the IMD process is designed to iteratively denoise this noisy partial mask, eventually leading to the attainment of the complete mask. As illustrated in \\cref{fig:teaser}, each IMD step comprises two crucial stages: generation and segmentation. The generation stage's objective is to produce complete object images conditioning on the visible portion of the target object and an object mask. Meanwhile, the segmentation stage is geared towards segmenting the object mask within the generated images and aggregating these segmented masks to obtain a superior mask that serves as the condition for the subsequent IMD step. By seamlessly integrating the generation and segmentation stages, we demonstrate that each IMD step effectively operates as a mask-denoising mechanism, taking a partially observed mask as input and yielding a progressively more complete mask as output. Consequently, through this iterative mask denoising process, the originally incomplete mask evolves into a satisfactory complete object mask, enabling the generation of complete objects guided by this refined mask.\n\nThe effectiveness of MaskComp is demonstrated by its capacity to address scenarios involving heavily occluded objects and its ability to generate realistic object representations through the utilization of mask guidance. In contrast to recent progress in the field of image generation research, our contributions can be succinctly outlined as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We explore and unveil the benefits of incorporating object masks into the object completion task. A novel approach, MaskComp, is proposed to seamlessly bridge the generation and segmentation.\n    \n    \\item We formulate the partial mask as a form of noisy complete mask and introduce an iterative mask denoising (IMD) process, consisting of alternating generation and segmentation stages, to refine the object mask and thus improve the object completion. \n    \n    \\item We conduct extensive experiments for analysis and comparison, the results of which indicate the strength and robustness of MaskComp against previous methods, \\eg, Stable Diffusion. \n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\\section{Related Works}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Conditional image generation.}\nConditional image generation \\cite{lee2022autoregressive,gafni2022make,li2023gligen} involves the process of creating images based on specific conditions. These conditions can take various forms, such as layout \\citep{li2020bachgan,sun2019image,zhao2019image}, sketch \\citep{Koley_2023_CVPR}, or semantic masks \\citep{gu2019mask}. For instance, Cascaded Diffusion Models \\citep{ho2022cascaded} utilize ImageNet class labels as conditions, employing a two-stage pipeline of multiple diffusion models to generate high-resolution images. Meanwhile, in the work by \\citep{sehwag2022generating}, diffusion models are guided to produce novel images from low-density regions within the data manifold. Another noteworthy approach is CLIP \\citep{radford2021clip}, which has gained widespread adoption in guiding image generation in GANs using text prompts \\citep{galatolo2021generating, gal2022stylegan, zhou2021lafite}. In the realm of diffusion models, Semantic Diffusion Guidance \\citep{liu2023more} explores a unified framework for diffusion-based image generation with language, image, or multi-modal conditions. Dhariwal et al. \\citep{dhariwal2021diffusion} employ an ablated diffusion model that utilizes the gradients of a classifier to guide the diffusion process, balancing diversity and fidelity. Furthermore, Ho et al. \\citep{ho2022classifier} introduce classifier-free guidance in conditional diffusion models, incorporating score estimates from both a conditional diffusion model and a jointly trained unconditional diffusion model. \n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Object segmentation.}\nIn the realm of segmentation, traditional approaches have traditionally leaned on domain-specific network architectures to tackle various segmentation tasks, including semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation \\citep{fcn, deeplabv1, mask-rcnn, spatial-instance, associate-instance, solo, panoptic-deeplab, max-deeplab, li2023towards,li2023panoramic,li2023robust,li2023rethinking,li2023paintseg,li2022video,li2022hybrid}. However, recent strides in transformer-based methodologies, have highlighted the effectiveness of treating these tasks as mask classification challenges \\citep{maskformer, knet, mask2former, detr}. MaskFormer \\citep{maskformer} and its enhanced variant \\citep{mask2former} have introduced transformer-based architectures, coupling each mask prediction with a learnable query. Unlike prior techniques that learn semantic labels at the pixel level, they directly link semantic labels with mask predictions through query-based prediction. Notably, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) \\citep{kirillov2023segment} represents a cutting-edge segmentation model that accommodates diverse visual and textual cues for zero-shot object segmentation. Similarly, SEEM \\citep{zou2023segment} is another universal segmentation model that extends its capabilities to include object referencing through audio and scribble inputs. By leveraging those foundation segmentation models, \\eg, SAM and SEEM, a number of downstream tasks can be boosted \\citep{ma2023segment,cen2023segment,yu2023inpaint}.\n\n\n\n\\section{MaskComp}\n\n\\label{sec:IMD}\n\n\\subsection{Problem Definition and Key Insight}\nWe address the object completion task, wherein the objective is to predict the image of a complete object $I_c\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times H\\times W}$, based on its visible (non-occluded) part $I_p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times H\\times W}$. \n\nWe first discuss the high-level idea of the proposed \\textbf{I}terative \\textbf{M}ask \\textbf{D}enoising (IMD) and then illustrate the module details in \\cref{sec:object completion} and \\cref{sec:object segmentation}. The core of IMD is based on an essential observation: In the mask-conditioned generation, the quality of the generated object is intricately tied to the quality of the conditioned mask. As shown in \\cref{fig:mask_condition}, we visualize the completion result of the same partial object but with different conditioning masks. We notice a more complete object mask condition will result in a more complete and realistic object image. \nBased on this observation, high-quality occluded object completion can be achieved by providing a complete object mask as the condition.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/mask_condition.pdf}\n\\caption{Object completion with different mask conditions.}\n\\label{fig:mask_condition}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering    \n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/pipeline.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Illustration of CompNet (generation stage of MaskComp).} The CompNet aims to recover the complete object $I_c$ from the partial object $I_p$ and a mask $M$. An object encoder is utilized to extract partial token $c_p$ which is gated and fed to the ControlNet to form the complete token $c_c$. The complete token $c_c$ serves as the condition to the diffusion U-Net to guide the conditional denoising process. In addition, a pre-diffusion mask is predicted from the partial token to encourage the object encoder to capture shape information.}\n    \\label{fig:pipeline}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\subsection{Iterative Mask Denoising}\nHowever, in real-world scenarios, the complete object mask is not available. To address this problem, we propose the IMD process which leverages intertwined generation and segmentation processes to approach the partial mask to the complete mask gradually. \nGiven a partially visible object $I_p$ and its corresponding partial mask $M_p$, the conventional object completion task aims to find a generative model $\\mathcal{G}$ such that $I_c\\leftarrow\\mathcal{G}(I_p)$, where $I_c$ is the complete object. Here, we additionally add the partial mask $M_p$ to the condition  $I_c\\leftarrow\\mathcal{G}(I_p, M_p)$, where $M_p$ can be assumed as an addition of the complete mask and a noise $M_p=M_c+\\Delta$. By introducing a segmentation model $\\mathcal{S}$, we can find a mask denoiser $\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}$ from the object completion model:\n\\begin{equation}\nM_c\\leftarrow\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}(I_p, M_c+\\Delta)\n\\label{equ:mask denoiser}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $M_c=\\mathcal{S}(I_c)$.\nStarting from the visible mask $M_0=M_p$, as shown in \\cref{fig:teaser}, we repeatedly apply the mask denoiser $\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}$ to gradually approach the visible mask $M_p$ to complete mask $M_c$. In each step, the input mask is denoised with a stack of generation and segmentation stages. Specifically, as the $\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}(\\cdot)$ includes a generative process, we can obtain a set of estimations of denoised mask $\\{M_t^{(k)}\\}$. Here, we utilize a function $\\mathcal{V}(\\cdot)$ to find a more complete and reasonable mask from the $N$ sampled masks and leverage it as the input mask for the next iteration to further denoise. The updating rule can be written as:\n\\begin{equation}\nM_{t}^{(k)}=\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}(I_p,\\hat{M}_{t-1}),\\,\\,\\,\n\\hat{M_t}=\\mathcal{V}(M_t^{(1)},\\cdots,M_t^{(N)})\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $N$ is the number of sampled images in each iteration. With a satisfactory complete mask $\\hat{M}_T$ after $T$ iterations, the object completion can be achieved accordingly by $\\mathcal{G}(I_p,\\hat{M}_T)$. The mathematical explanation of the process will be discussed in \\cref{sec:discussion}. \n\n\n\\subsection{Generation Stage}\n\\label{sec:object completion}\nWe introduce \\textbf{\\textsl{CompNet}} as the generative model $\\mathcal{G}$ which aims to recover complete objects based on partial conditions. We build CompNet based on popular ControlNet \\cite{zhang2023adding} while making fundamental modifications to enable object completion. As shown in \\cref{tab:form diff}, the target of ControlNet is to generate images strictly based on the given conditions, \\ie, $I_p\\leftarrow\\mathcal{G}(I_p,M_p)$, making it unable to complete object. Differently, CompNet is designed to recover the object. With a segmentation network, it can act as a mask denoiser to refine the conditioned mask, \\ie, $M_c\\leftarrow\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}(I_p,M_p)$.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\scalebox{0.77}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}\n    \\hline\n    Method  & Objective & Objective with Segm. &  Object Comp.\\\\\n    \\hline\n    ControlNet & $I_p\\leftarrow\\mathcal{G}(I_p,M_p)$ & $M_p\\leftarrow\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}(I_p,M_p)$ & \\textcolor{red}{\\XSolidBrush}\\\\\n    CompNet & $I_c\\leftarrow\\mathcal{G}(I_p,M_p)$ & $M_c\\leftarrow\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}(I_p,M_p)$ & \\textcolor{mygreen}{\\Checkmark}\\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}}\n    \\caption{Objective difference with ControlNet.}\n    \\label{tab:form diff}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Mask condition.}\nAs illustrated on the left side of \\cref{fig:pipeline}, we begin with a complete object $I_c$ and its corresponding mask $M_c$. Our approach commences by occluding the complete object, retaining only the partially visible portion as $I_p$. Recall that the mask-denoising procedure initiates with the partial mask $M_p$ and culminates with the complete mask $M_c$. To facilitate this iterative denoising, the model must effectively handle any mask that falls within the interpolation between the initial partial mask and the target complete mask. Consequently, we introduce a mask $M$ with an occlusion rate positioned between the partial and complete masks as a conditioning factor for the generative model. The partial mask $M_p$ is achieved by considering the occluded areas in both occlusion processes. The interpolated mask $M$ is generated by using one of the occlusions. \n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Diffusion model.}\nDiffusion models have achieved notable progress in synthesizing unprecedented image quality and have been successfully applied to many text-based image generation works \\citep{rombach2022high,zhang2023adding}. For our object completion task, the complete object can be generated by leveraging the diffusion process.\n\nSpecifically, the diffusion model generates image latent $x$ by gradually reversing a Markov forward process. As shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:pipeline}, starting from $x_0=\\mathcal{E}(I_c)$, the forward process yields a sequence of increasing noisy tokens $\\{x_\\tau|\\tau\\in[1,T_{\\mathcal{G}}]\\}$, where $x_\\tau=\\sqrt{\\Bar{\\alpha_\\tau}}y_0+\\sqrt{1-\\Bar{\\alpha_\\tau}}\\epsilon$, $\\epsilon$ is the Gaussian noise, and $\\alpha_\\tau$ decreases with the timestep $\\tau$. For the denoising process, the diffusion model progressively denoises a noisy token from the last step given the conditions $c=(I_p,M,E)$ by minimizing the following loss function: $\\mathcal{L}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\tau,x_0,\\epsilon}\\|\\epsilon_\\theta(x_\\tau,c,\\tau)-\\epsilon\\|_2^2$. $I_p$, $M$, and $E$ are the partial object, conditioned mask, and text prompt respectively.\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering    \n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/mask.pdf}\n    \\caption{\n    We calculate the mask probability map by averaging and normalizing the masks of sampled images. We show a cross-section of the lower leg to better visualize (shown as \\textcolor{darkyellow}{yellow}). \n    }\n    \\label{fig:mask}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{CompNet architecture.}\nPrevious work \\citep{zhang2023adding} has demonstrated an effective way to add additional control to generative diffusion models. We follow this architecture and make necessary modifications to adapt the architecture to object completion. As shown in \\cref{fig:pipeline}, given the visible object $I_p$ and the conditioning mask $M$, we first concatenate them and extract the partial token $c_p$ with an object encoder. \nDifferent from ControlNet \\citep{zhang2023adding} assuming the condition is accurate, the object completion task relies on incomplete conditions. Specifically, in the early diffusion steps, the condition information is vital to complete the object. Nevertheless, in the later steps, inaccurate information in the condition can degrade the generated object. To tackle this problem, we introduce a time-variant gating operation to adjust the importance of conditions in the diffusion steps. We learn a linear transform $f: \\mathbb{R}^{C}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{1}$ upon the time embedding $e_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{C}$ and then apply it to the partial token as $f(e_t)\\cdot c_p$ before feeding it to the ControlNet. In this way, the importance of visible features can be adjusted as the diffusion steps forward. The time embedding used for the gating operation is shared with the time embedding for encoding the diffusion step in the stable diffusion.\n\nTo encourage the object encoder to capture shape information, we introduce an auxiliary path to predict the complete object mask from the partial token $c_p$. Specifically, a feature pyramid network \\cite{lin2017feature} is leveraged as the mask decoder which takes $c_p$ and the multi-scale features from the object encoder as input and outputs a pre-diffusion mask $M_{pre}$. We encourage mask completion with supervision as\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{mask}=\\mathcal{L}_{dice}(M_c,M_{pre})+\\lambda_{ce}\\mathcal{L}_{ce}(M_c,M_{pre})\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{dice}$ and $\\mathcal{L}{ce}$ are Dice loss \\cite{li2019dice} and BCE loss respectively. $\\lambda_{ce}$ is a constant.\n\n\\subsection{Segmentation Stage}\n\\label{sec:object segmentation}\nIn the segmentation stage, illustrated in \\cref{fig:mask} (a), our approach initiates by sampling $N$ images denoted as $\\{I_t^{(k)}\\}^N_{k=1}$ from the generative model, where $t$ is the IMD step. Subsequently, we employ an off-the-shelf object segmentation model denoted as $\\mathcal{S}(\\cdot)$ to obtain the shapes (object masks) $\\{M_t^{(k)}\\}$ from these sampled images.\n\nTo derive an improved mask for the subsequent IMD step, we seek a function $\\mathcal{V}(\\cdot)$ that can produce a high-quality mask prediction from the set of $N$ generated masks. Interestingly, though the distribution of sampled images is complex, we notice the distribution of masks has good properties.\nIn \\cref{fig:mask} (b), we provide a visualization of the probability map associated with a set of object masks with the same conditions, which is computed by taking the normalized average of the masks.\nTo enhance the visualization of this probability distribution, we focus on a specific cross-section of the fully occluded portion in image $I_p$ (the lower leg, represented as a \\textcolor{darkyellow}{yellow} section) and visualize the probability as a function of the horizontal coordinate which demonstrates an obvious unimodal and symmetric property. Leveraging this observation, we can find an improved mask by taking the high-probability region. \nThe updating can be achieved by conducting a voting process across the $N$ estimated masks, as defined by the following equation:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{M}_t[i,j] = \\begin{cases}\n                1, & \\text{if}\\quad \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^NM_t^{(k)}[i,j]}{N} \\geq \\tau \\\\\n                0, & \\text{otherwise}\n        \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $[i,j]$ denotes the coordinate, and $\\tau$ is the threshold employed for the mask voting process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering   \n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/dist.pdf}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Mutual-benificial sampling.}}\n\\label{fig:mutual}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\scalebox{0.9}{\n\\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}|p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}} \n\\hline\n\\multirow{2}*{Method} & \\multicolumn{4}{c|}{AHP \\citep{zhou2021human}} &\n\\multicolumn{4}{c}{DYCE \\citep{ehsani2018segan}}\\\\\n\\cline{2-9}\n~ & FID-G $\\downarrow$ & FID-S $\\downarrow$ & Rank $\\downarrow$ & Best $\\uparrow$ & FID-G $\\downarrow$ & FID-S $\\downarrow$ & Rank $\\downarrow$ & Best $\\uparrow$\\\\\n\\hline\nControlNet & 40.2 & 45.4 & 3.4 & 0.10 & 42.4 & 49.4 & 3.4 & 0.08 \\\\\nKandinsky 2.1 & 43.9 & 39.2 & 3.2 & 0.11 & 44.3 & 47.7 &  3.4 & 0.06 \\\\\nStable Diffusion 1.5 & 35.7 & 41.4 & 3.2 & 0.12 & 31.2 & 43.4 & 3.4 & 0.11 \\\\\nStable Diffusion 2.1 & 30.8 & 39.9 & 3.1 & 0.14 & 30.0 & 41.1 & 3.0 & 0.12 \\\\\n\\bf MaskComp (Ours) & \\bf16.9 & \\bf21.3 &\\bf2.1 & \\bf0.53 & \\bf 20.0 & \\bf25.4 & \\bf1.9 & \\bf0.63  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Quantitative evaluation on object completion task}.

Instead, it necessitates the more challenging joint modeling of objects and masks, denoted as $p(I,M)$, where the images and masks can range from partial to complete. Let us understand the joint distribution by exploring its marginals. Since the relation between mask and image is one-to-many (each object image only has one mask while the same mask can be segmented from multiple images), the $p(M|I)$ is actually a Dirac delta distribution $\\delta$ and only the $p(I|M)$ is a real distribution. This way, the joint distribution of mask and image is discrete and complex, making the modeling difficult. To address this issue, we introduce a slack condition to the joint distribution $p(I,M)$ that \\textit{the mask and image can follow a many-to-many relation}, which makes its marginal $p(M|I)$ a real distribution and permits $p(I|M)$ to predict image $I$ that has a different shape as the conditioned $M$ and vice versa. \n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/compare.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Qualitative comparison against ControlNet, Kandinsky and Stable Diffusion}. The background is filtered out for better visualization.}\n    \\label{fig:compare}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Mutual-beneficial sampling.}\nAfter discussing the joint distribution that we are targeting, we introduce the mathematical explanation of MaskComp. MaskComp introduces the alternating modeling of two marginal distributions $p(I|M)$ (generation stage) and $p(M|I)$ (segmentation stage), which is actually a Markov Chain Monte Carlo-like (MCMC-like) process and more specifically Gibbs sampling-like. It samples the joint distribution $p(I,M)$ by iterative sampling from the marginal distributions. Two core insights are incorporated in MaskComp: (1) providing a mask as a condition can effectively enhance object generation and (2) fusing the mask of generated object images can result in a more accurate and complete object mask. Based on these insights, we train CompNet to maximize $p(I|M)$ and leverage mask voting to maximize the $p(M|I)$. As shown in \\cref{fig:mutual}, MaskComp develops a mutual-beneficial sampling process from the joint distribution $p(I,M)$, where the object mask is provided to boost the image generation and, in return, the generated images can lead to a more accurate mask by fusing the segmentation of images. Through alternating sampling from the marginal distributions, we can effectively address the object completion task.\n\n\n\n\\section{Experiment}\n\n\\subsection{Experimental Settings}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Dataset.}\nWe evaluate MaskComp on two popular datasets: AHP \\citep{zhou2021human} and DYCE \\citep{ehsani2018segan}. \nAHP is an amodal human perception dataset with 56,302 images with annotations of integrated humans.\nDYCE is a synthetic dataset with photo-realistic images and the natural configuration of objects in indoor scenes.\nFor both datasets, the non-occluded object and its corresponding mask for each object are available. We train MaskComp on the AHP and a filtered subset of OpenImage v6 \\citep{kuznetsova2020open}. OpenImage is a large-scale dataset offering heterogeneous annotations. We select a subset of OpenImage that contains 429,358 objects as a training set of MaskComp.\n\\tableablation{t}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Evaluation metrics.}\nIn accordance with previous methods \\citep{zhou2021human}, we evaluate image generation quality Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID). The background is removed with object masks before evaluation. \nAs the FID score cannot reflect the object completeness, we further conduct a user study, leveraging human assessment to compare the quality and completeness of images. During the assessment, given a partial object, the participants are required to rank the generated object from different methods based on their completeness and quality.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Implementation details.}\nFor the generation stage, we train the CompNet with frozen Stable Diffusion \\citep{rombach2022high} on the AHP dataset for 50 epochs. The learning rate is set for 1e-5. We adopt $\\mathrm{batchsize}=8$ and an Adam \\citep{loshchilov2017adamw} optimizer. \nThe image is resized to $512\\times 512$ for both training and inference. \nThe object is cropped and resized to have the longest side 360 before sticking on the image. \nFor a more generalized setting, we train the CompNet on a subset of the OpenImage \\citep{kuznetsova2020open} dataset for 36 epochs. We generate text prompts using BLIP \\citep{li2022blip} for all experiments (prompts are necessary to train ControlNet). For the segmentation stage, we leverage SAM \\citep{kirillov2023segment} as $\\mathcal{S}(\\cdot)$. We vote mask with a threshold of $\\tau=0.5$. During inference, if no other specification, we conduct the IMD process for 5 steps with $N=5$ images for each step. We give the class label as the text prompt to facilitate the CompNet to effectively generate objects. All baseline methods are given the same text prompts during the experiments. The code will be made publicly available.\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Quantitative results.}\nWe compare the MaskComp with state-of-the-art methods, ControlNet \\citep{zhang2023adding}, Kandinsky 2.1 \\citep{kandinsky2}, Stable Diffusion 1.5 \\citep{rombach2022high} and Stable Diffusion 2.1 \\citep{rombach2022high} on AHP \\citep{zhou2021human} and DYCE \\citep{ehsani2018segan} dataset. The results in \\cref{tab:main results} indicate that MaskComp consistently outperforms other methods, as evidenced by its notably lower FID scores, signifying the superior quality of its generated content. We conducted a user study to evaluate object completeness in which participants ranked images generated by different approaches. MaskComp achieved an impressive average ranking of 2.1 and 1.9 on the AHP and DYCE datasets respectively. Furthermore, MaskComp also generates the highest number of images ranked as the most complete and realistic compared to previous methods. We consider the introduced mask condition and the proposed IMD process benefits the performance of MaskComp, where the additional conditioned mask provides robust shape guidance to the generation process and the proposed iterative mask denoising process refines the initial conditioned mask to a more complete shape, further enhancing the generated image quality.   \n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Qualitative results.}\nWe present visual comparisons among ControlNet, Kandinsky 2.1, Stable Diffusion 1.5, and Stable Diffusion 2.1, illustrated in \\cref{fig:compare}. Our visualizations showcase MaskComp's ability to produce realistic and complete object images given partial images as the condition, whereas previous approaches exhibit noticeable artifacts and struggle to achieve realistic object completion. In addition, without mask guidance, it is common for previous methods to generate images that fail to align with the partial object.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering    \n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/vis_imd.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Visualization of the IMD process.} For each step, we randomly demonstrate one generated image and the averaged mask for all generated images. We omit the input mask which has the same shape as the input occluded object.\n    }\n    \\label{fig:vis_imd}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\tabdesignchoice{t}\n\n\\subsection{Analysis}\n\\label{sec:analysis}\nIn this section, we provide an experimental analysis of MaskComp. All the results are evaluated with GT masks to filter out the background, \\ie, FID-G.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Performance with different mask conditions.}\nWe evaluated the quality of generated images when conditioned on the same partial images along with three distinct types of masks: (1) partial mask (mask of the partial image), (2) intermediate mask (less occlusion than partial), and (3) complete mask. As shown in \\cref{tab:conditioned mask}, the model achieves its highest performance when it is conditioned with complete object masks, whereas relying solely on partial masks yields less optimal results. These results provide strong evidence that the quality of the conditioned mask significantly influences the quality of the generated images.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Performance with different occlusion rates.}\nWe perform ablation studies to assess the resilience of MaskComp under varying occlusion levels. As presented in \\cref{tab:occ}, we evaluate MaskComp at different occlusion levels (proportion of the obscured area relative to the complete object) ranging from 20\\% to 80\\%, and the results indicate that its performance does not degrade significantly up to 60\\% occlusion.\n\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Inference time.} \\cref{tab:time} reports the inference time of each component in IMD (with a single NVIDIA V100 GPU). Although MaskComp's throughput is reduced due to the inclusion of multiple diffusion processes in each IMD step, it is capable of attaining a higher degree of accuracy in visual object completion. Based on our empirical experiments, reducing the number of diffusion steps during the first few IMD steps can increase model speed without sacrificing much performance. With this idea incorporated into MaskComp, the average running time could be reduced to 2/3 of the original time with FID slightly increasing by 0.50. While beyond the scope of this study, we expect more advanced techniques could be explored to optimize the tradeoff between model speed and performance.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Comparison to amodal segmentation baseline.}\nAmodal segmentation has a similar objective to the proposed IMD process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MaskComp, we construct an amodal baseline that generates amodal masks from the SOTA amodal segmentation method \\cite{tran2022aisformer} and then utilize ControlNet to generate images based on the amodal masks. s shown in \\cref{tab:amodal}, we notice that our method outperforms the amodal baseline by a considerable margin, which could be attributed to the strong mask completion capability of the proposed IMD process.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\scalebox{0.95}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{c|ccccc}\n        Noise degree & Iter. 1 & Iter. 3 & Iter. 5 & Iter. 7 & Iter. 9 \\\\\n        \\toprule\n        15\\% area & 28.4 & 22.7 & 18.9 & 17.2 & 16.5 \\\\\n        10\\% area & 26.4 & 21.4 & 18.1 & 17.0 & 16.4 \\\\\n        5\\% area & 24.9 & 19.6 & 17.0 & 16.2 & 16.0 \\\\\n        No noise & 24.7 & 19.4 & 16.9 & 16.1 & 15.9 \n    \\end{tabular}}\n    \\caption{Performance against segmentation errors on AHP dataset.}\n    \\label{tab:robust}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Impact of different segmentation networks.} \nWe adopt SAM to obtain object masks at the segmentation stage. To study the impacts of different segmenters, we replace SAM with two smaller segmentation networks, CLIPSeg \\cite{luddecke2022image} and SEEM \\cite{zou2023segment}. \\cref{tab:segm model} shows that the FID score with CLIPSeg (19.9) is slightly higher than with SAM (16.9), but remains competitive against other state-of-the-art methods, e.g., Stable Diffusion 2.1 (30.8 reported in \\cref{tab:main results}). MaskComp is an iterative mask denoising (IMD) process that progressively refines a partial object mask to boost image generation. The results support our hypothesis that the impact of the segmenter is modest.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Design choices in IMD.}\nWe conduct experiments to ablate the design choices in IMD and their impacts on the completion performance. We first study the effect of IMD step number. With a larger step number, IMD can better advance the partial mask to the complete mask. As shown in \\cref{tab:step number}, we notice that the image quality keeps increasing and slows down at a step number of 5. In this way, we choose 5 as our IMD step number. After that, we ablate the number of sampled images in the segmentation stage in \\cref{tab:image number}. We notice more sampled images generally leading to a better performance. We leverage an image number of 5 with the efficiency consideration. As we leverage the diffusion-based method for image generation, we ablate the iterations for the diffusion process. As shown in \\cref{tab:gating}, we notice the gating operation improves the generation quality by 1.3 FID, indicating the necessity of conditional gating.\n\\noindent\\textbf{Robustness to segmentation errors.} \nWe conduct experiments to manually add random errors to masks. As shown in \\cref{tab:robust}, we ablate on the number of iterations and the degree of segmentation error. We observe that segmentation errors will increase the convergence iteration number while not affecting the final performance significantly. As IMD is a reciprocal process intended to provide effective control for later-generated masks to be refined based on adaptive feedback, mask errors are mitigated and not propagated.\n\\noindent\\textbf{Visualization of iterative mask denoising.}\nTo provide a clearer depiction of the IMD process, as depicted in \\cref{fig:vis_imd}, we present visualizations of the generated image and the averaged mask for each step. In the initial step, we observe the emergence of artifacts alongside the object. As we progress through the steps, both the image and mask quality exhibit continuous improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nIn this paper, we introduce MaskComp, a novel approach for object completion. MaskComp addresses the object completion task by seamlessly integrating conditional generation and segmentation, capitalizing on the crucial observation that the quality of generated objects is intricately tied to the quality of the conditioned masks. We augment the object completion process with an additional mask condition and propose an iterative mask denoising (IMD) process. This iterative approach gradually refines the partial object mask, ultimately leading to the generation of satisfactory objects by leveraging the complete mask as a guiding condition. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of MaskComp, particularly in challenging scenarios involving heavily occluded objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "decision": "Reject", "review": [{"id": "Qy9zmHkvzJ", "rating": 6, "content": {"summary": "This paper presents a method to complete an object which undergoes occlusion.

However, the core novelty seems to stem from the clever application of existing techniques rather than a fundamental breakthrough in either image generation or segmentation. To strengthen the contribution, the authors could explore the theoretical underpinnings of their iterative method more deeply. For example, analyzing the convergence properties of the alternating generation and segmentation steps could provide valuable insights. Specifically, under what conditions does this iterative process converge to a stable and accurate completion? What are the limitations of this approach in terms of the types of occlusions or object complexities it can handle effectively? A more rigorous analysis of these aspects would elevate the theoretical contribution of the paper.\n\nFurthermore, the paper could benefit from a more detailed exploration of the interplay between the generation and segmentation stages. While the authors mention that these stages help each other, a deeper analysis of how the quality of the segmentation mask affects the generation and vice versa would be beneficial. For instance, how does the uncertainty in the segmentation mask propagate through the generation process? Are there specific types of segmentation errors that lead to more significant artifacts in the generated image? Investigating these questions could lead to more robust and reliable completion results. Additionally, the authors could explore alternative methods for combining multiple generated images to produce the final segmentation mask, instead of simple averaging. Techniques such as weighted averaging based on the confidence of the generated images or more sophisticated ensemble methods could potentially improve the quality of the segmentation mask and, consequently, the final completion result.\n\nFinally, while the quantitative results are promising, the paper could benefit from a more comprehensive evaluation. The FID metric, while widely used, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of the completed objects. Incorporating additional metrics that assess the structural integrity and semantic consistency of the completed objects could provide a more holistic view of the method's performance. Moreover, a more detailed analysis of the failure cases would be valuable. Understanding the limitations of the proposed approach and identifying the types of occlusions or objects where it struggles would provide a more balanced perspective on its capabilities.

While the method shows promising results, the potential for error accumulation in each iteration is a significant concern. Specifically, the mask-denoising ControlNet, trained locally, could introduce artifacts or distortions in the generated image, which would then propagate to the subsequent segmentation stage. The segmentation model's output, if noisy, could further degrade the mask quality, leading to a potential divergence of the iterative process. The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the conditions under which the IMD process converges and the factors that might lead to its failure. This could involve a study of the sensitivity of the method to different types of initial masks and segmentation errors, as well as an analysis of the error propagation in the iterative process. Furthermore, a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the IMD process would be beneficial to understand its robustness and limitations.\n\nTo address the lack of mode diversity, the authors could explore alternative strategies for mask aggregation instead of averaging. For instance, they could consider using a probabilistic approach that maintains multiple mask hypotheses, each representing a different plausible completion. This could be achieved by sampling from the distribution of masks generated by the segmentation model, or by using a generative model to produce multiple mask candidates. The subsequent image generation stage could then be conditioned on each of these mask hypotheses, resulting in a set of diverse completed images. This would be particularly useful in scenarios where multiple valid completions exist, such as for articulated objects or objects with complex shapes. The authors should also investigate the impact of the averaging operator on the quality of the generated images, and whether it leads to a loss of detail or sharpness.\n\nFinally, the experimental evaluation needs to be strengthened. The comparison with baselines should be made more rigorous by ensuring that all methods are evaluated under the same conditions, including the handling of the background. The authors should also consider including a baseline that combines amodal segmentation with conditional image generation, as this is a natural comparison for their method. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the method to segmentation errors is needed. The authors should conduct experiments with different levels of segmentation noise and evaluate the impact on the quality of the generated images.

Figure 3 should be redrawn to accurately represent the denoising process, showing the progression from noisy $x_t$ to the denoised $x_0$, and should also clearly illustrate how the IMD time-steps are integrated.

The core idea revolves around the observation that the quality of mask-conditioned generation is directly tied to the quality of the mask itself. To leverage this, MaskComp employs an Iterative Mask Denoising (IMD) process, which alternates between generating an image based on the current mask and then refining that mask using an off-the-shelf segmentation model. This iterative process allows the method to progressively improve both the mask and the generated object, even in cases of significant occlusion. The method is built upon ControlNet, a conditional image generation framework, and incorporates a time-variant gating operation to modulate the influence of the mask during the diffusion process. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of MaskComp through extensive experiments on two datasets, AHP and DYCE, showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of both quantitative metrics and qualitative visual results. The paper also includes a thorough ablation study, exploring the impact of various design choices, such as the number of iterations, the choice of segmentation model, and the use of different conditioning masks. The results indicate that the proposed iterative approach is robust to segmentation errors and can handle various occlusion scenarios. The authors also show that the method can be used for amodal segmentation by comparing it to a baseline that combines a state-of-the-art amodal segmentation method with ControlNet. Overall, the paper presents a well-motivated and effective approach to object completion, with a clear focus on the interplay between mask quality and generative performance. The iterative nature of the method, coupled with the use of off-the-shelf segmentation models, makes it a practical and versatile solution for a range of image editing tasks. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, making it a valuable contribution to the field of image generation and editing.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n3.25\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nI find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. First, the core idea of iteratively refining both the mask and the generated object is both intuitive and effective. The authors clearly articulate the motivation behind this approach, highlighting the crucial relationship between mask quality and generative performance. This is a key insight that drives the entire method. Second, the experimental results are compelling. The authors demonstrate through extensive experiments on two datasets that MaskComp outperforms existing methods, including ControlNet and various versions of Stable Diffusion. The quantitative results, measured by FID scores, are significantly better than the baselines, and the qualitative results are also impressive, showing that MaskComp can generate realistic and complete objects even in cases of significant occlusion. The ablation study is also well-designed and thorough, exploring the impact of various design choices. This provides valuable insights into the inner workings of the method and demonstrates its robustness. The authors also show that the method is robust to segmentation errors, which is a crucial aspect for practical applications. The use of off-the-shelf segmentation models makes the method versatile and adaptable to different scenarios. Furthermore, the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors clearly explain the method and its components, making it accessible to a broad audience. The figures and tables are also well-presented and help to convey the key ideas and results. Finally, the authors have provided the code for their method, which is a valuable contribution to the community and will facilitate further research in this area. The fact that the method is built upon existing models like ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, and uses off-the-shelf segmentation models, makes it a practical and readily applicable solution for various image editing tasks. The authors have successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of their approach and have made a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant further discussion. First, while the paper demonstrates the effectiveness of MaskComp for object completion, it does not fully explore the potential of the learned model for other tasks. The method is trained specifically for the object completion task, and the experiments primarily focus on this application. While the authors show a comparison to an amodal segmentation baseline, they do not explore the possibility of using the trained model for amodal segmentation directly, or for other tasks such as image inpainting or outpainting. This limits the perceived versatility of the method. The paper states that the model is trained for 50 epochs on the AHP dataset and 36 epochs on a subset of OpenImage, which is a relatively small number of iterations, and I agree with the reviewer that more training iterations might improve the model's performance. Second, the paper lacks a thorough analysis of the failure cases of the method. While the authors present successful examples of object completion, they do not discuss the limitations of the approach or the scenarios where it might fail. This is a crucial aspect for understanding the practical applicability of the method. For example, the paper does not discuss how the method performs when the initial partial mask is inaccurate or when the object being completed is very complex. The paper also does not discuss the potential for the method to generate unrealistic or inconsistent results. This lack of discussion of limitations makes it difficult to fully assess the robustness of the method. Third, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the iterative mask denoising (IMD) process. While the authors provide the inference time for each component, they do not discuss the memory requirements or the impact of the number of iterations on the computational cost. This is an important consideration for practical applications, and the paper should provide more details on this aspect. The paper also does not compare the computational cost of MaskComp with other object completion methods. Fourth, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of the time-variant gating operation. While the authors mention that it is used to adjust the importance of conditions during the diffusion steps, they do not provide a detailed analysis of how this operation affects the generation process. The paper states that the gating operation improves the generation quality by 1.3 FID, but it does not provide a more detailed analysis of the impact of this operation. The paper also does not provide a clear explanation of the linear transform used in the gating operation. Fifth, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of the mask voting process. While the authors describe the mathematical formulation of the voting process, they do not provide a more detailed explanation of how this process works and how it affects the quality of the generated masks. The paper also does not discuss the potential limitations of the voting process, such as the possibility of introducing artifacts or biases. Sixth, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of the role of the object encoder and the auxiliary path for predicting the complete object mask. While the authors mention that the encoder captures shape information, they do not provide a more detailed analysis of how this is achieved. The paper also does not discuss the potential limitations of this approach, such as the possibility of the encoder failing to capture the complete shape of the object. Finally, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of the text prompts used in the experiments. While the authors mention that they use class labels as text prompts, they do not provide a more detailed explanation of how these prompts are generated and how they affect the generation process. The paper also does not discuss the potential limitations of using class labels as text prompts, such as the possibility of generating generic or unrealistic results. In summary, while the paper presents a novel and effective approach to object completion, it lacks a thorough analysis of the limitations, computational cost, and the impact of various design choices. These weaknesses limit the practical applicability of the method and make it difficult to fully assess its robustness.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nBased on the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements for this paper. First, the authors should explore the potential of the learned model for other tasks beyond object completion. Specifically, they should investigate the possibility of using the trained model for amodal segmentation, image inpainting, or outpainting. This would demonstrate the versatility of the method and make it more appealing to a broader audience. The authors could also explore fine-tuning the model on different datasets to assess its generalization capabilities. Second, the authors should conduct a more thorough analysis of the failure cases of the method. This should include a discussion of the scenarios where the method might fail, such as when the initial partial mask is inaccurate or when the object being completed is very complex. The authors should also discuss the potential for the method to generate unrealistic or inconsistent results. This analysis would provide a more balanced view of the method's capabilities and limitations. Third, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the iterative mask denoising (IMD) process. This should include a discussion of the memory requirements and the impact of the number of iterations on the computational cost. The authors should also compare the computational cost of MaskComp with other object completion methods. This analysis would help to assess the practical applicability of the method. Fourth, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the time-variant gating operation. This should include a discussion of how this operation affects the generation process and how it is related to the diffusion steps. The authors should also provide a more detailed explanation of the linear transform used in the gating operation. Fifth, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the mask voting process. This should include a discussion of how this process works and how it affects the quality of the generated masks. The authors should also discuss the potential limitations of the voting process, such as the possibility of introducing artifacts or biases. Sixth, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the role of the object encoder and the auxiliary path for predicting the complete object mask. This should include a discussion of how the encoder captures shape information and how the auxiliary path contributes to the overall performance of the method. The authors should also discuss the potential limitations of this approach, such as the possibility of the encoder failing to capture the complete shape of the object. Finally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the text prompts used in the experiments. This should include a discussion of how these prompts are generated and how they affect the generation process. The authors should also discuss the potential limitations of using class labels as text prompts, such as the possibility of generating generic or unrealistic results. In addition to these specific suggestions, I also recommend that the authors conduct more training iterations, as this might improve the model's performance. Overall, these suggestions are aimed at addressing the identified weaknesses and making the paper more complete and robust.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nI have several questions that arise from my analysis of this paper. First, I am curious about the specific details of the time-variant gating operation. While the paper mentions that it is used to adjust the importance of conditions during the diffusion steps, I would like to understand more about the exact mechanism of this operation. Specifically, how is the linear transform learned, and how does it relate to the diffusion steps? What is the impact of different gating functions on the final results? Second, I am interested in the details of the mask voting process. While the paper provides the mathematical formulation of this process, I would like to understand more about how it works in practice. How does the voting process handle cases where there are multiple distinct object parts in the generated images? What is the impact of different thresholds on the final mask quality? Third, I would like to understand more about the role of the object encoder and the auxiliary path for predicting the complete object mask. How does the encoder capture shape information from the partial object and mask? What is the impact of the auxiliary path on the overall performance of the method? How does the auxiliary path interact with the main diffusion process? Fourth, I am curious about the choice of text prompts used in the experiments. While the paper mentions that class labels are used as text prompts, I would like to understand more about how these prompts are generated and how they affect the generation process. What is the impact of using different types of text prompts, such as more descriptive or ambiguous prompts? Fifth, I would like to understand more about the limitations of the method. What are the scenarios where the method is likely to fail? How does the method perform when the initial partial mask is inaccurate or when the object being completed is very complex? What is the potential for the method to generate unrealistic or inconsistent results? Finally, I would like to understand more about the potential for extending the method to other tasks beyond object completion. How could the learned model be used for amodal segmentation, image inpainting, or outpainting? What are the challenges and opportunities for extending the method to these other tasks? These questions are aimed at clarifying some of the key uncertainties in the paper and at exploring the potential for future research directions.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n6.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.75\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nAccept\n}", "pred_standard_mode": "I will use Standard Mode for comprehensive thinking.

The authors argue that the quality of mask-conditioned generation is heavily influenced by the quality of the conditioned mask. Building on this observation, they propose combining object masks with an IMD process to enhance object completion. The IMD process gradually refines incomplete masks, providing better shape guidance. It works by iteratively denoising a partial mask through alternating generation and segmentation stages, progressively improving the mask until it becomes complete.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2 fair\n\n### Presentation\n\n2 fair\n\n### Contribution\n\n2 fair\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The proposed iterative mask denoising (IMD) process is simple yet effective, and the idea of iteratively refining the mask through alternating generation and segmentation stages is reasonable.\n2. The experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in completing objects, and the visual examples provided in the paper are compelling.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. My primary concern is that the paper lacks a clear definition of the problem it aims to address. The authors should provide a more precise explanation of the object completion task, particularly regarding the input and expected output. For instance, does the input include only the object mask and image, or does it also encompass the background? What is the specific goal of the completion\u2014should the model generate multiple plausible outputs, or should it aim to recover the original object? In cases where the object is significantly occluded, is it even reasonable to expect the model to recover the original object? The lack of clarity on these points makes it difficult to fully understand the scope and limitations of the proposed method. For example, the paper does not specify how the method would handle scenarios where the occlusion is so severe that the object's shape is largely ambiguous, or if the input mask is noisy or inaccurate. This lack of specificity makes it hard to evaluate the practical applicability of the approach.\n\n2. The paper does not adequately address how the proposed method handles complex backgrounds. Object completion can be a challenging task, especially when the background is intricate or contains patterns similar to the object itself. The example provided in Figure 7, which involves a human subject, raises questions about the method's ability to handle complex backgrounds effectively. It is unclear how the method would perform in situations where the background contains textures or colors that closely resemble the object, potentially leading to artifacts or incorrect completions. The paper lacks a discussion of the potential limitations and failure modes of the method in such scenarios.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo address the lack of clarity regarding the problem definition, the authors should provide a detailed specification of the input and output for the object completion task. This should include a clear explanation of whether the input consists solely of the object and its mask, or if the background is also considered. Furthermore, the authors need to specify the expected behavior of the model when dealing with heavily occluded objects or noisy masks. For example, they could define the method's behavior in cases where only 20% of the object is visible, or when the input mask has a certain percentage of error. It would also be beneficial to discuss the method's limitations and provide examples of scenarios where the method might fail. This would help to set realistic expectations for the performance of the proposed approach. The authors should also clarify whether the goal is to recover the original object or to generate a plausible completion, and how this is handled in the training process.\n\nTo improve the discussion of the method's performance with complex backgrounds, the authors should include a more thorough analysis of how the method handles different types of backgrounds. This could involve testing the method on a variety of datasets with varying background complexities, and reporting the results separately for each type. The authors should also discuss the potential for the method to confuse object boundaries with similar patterns in the background, and how this issue is addressed. For example, they could analyze the impact of background complexity on the quality of the completed object, and provide examples of both successful and unsuccessful cases. It would be beneficial to include a quantitative analysis of the method's performance on images with complex backgrounds, such as those with cluttered scenes or textures similar to the object. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's strengths and limitations.\n\nFinally, the authors should consider including a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the iterative mask denoising process. While the method is described as simple, the iterative nature of the process may introduce significant computational overhead. The authors should provide a quantitative analysis of the time and memory requirements of the method, and compare it to other object completion techniques. This would help to evaluate the practical applicability of the method in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the authors could explore potential optimizations to reduce the computational cost of the method, such as using more efficient segmentation models or reducing the number of iterations. This would make the method more accessible and useful for a wider range of applications.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease refer to the Weaknesses.\n\n### Rating\n\n5: marginally below the acceptance threshold\n\n### Confidence\n\n4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain.

The method works by iteratively refining the object mask through alternating stages of generation and segmentation. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of MaskComp through experiments on two popular datasets, AHP and DYCE, showing that it outperforms existing methods in terms of image quality and object completeness.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3 good\n\n### Presentation\n\n3 good\n\n### Contribution\n\n3 good\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The proposed method is novel and addresses an important problem in computer vision. The idea of combining generation and segmentation to iteratively refine the object mask is interesting and has the potential to be applied to other tasks.\n\n2. The experiments are well-designed and comprehensive, including both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The authors compare MaskComp with several state-of-the-art methods and show that it achieves better performance on two popular datasets.\n\n3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors provide clear explanations of the method and the experiments, and the figures and tables are helpful in understanding the results.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The method relies on an off-the-shelf segmentation model, which may limit its performance if the segmentation model is not accurate. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of how the choice of segmentation model affects the overall performance of MaskComp. Specifically, the paper lacks experiments showing how different segmentation models with varying accuracy impact the final object completion quality. This is a critical oversight, as the iterative nature of the method means that errors in segmentation will propagate and potentially be amplified in subsequent iterations.\n\n2. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of MaskComp. The iterative process of alternating between generation and segmentation could be computationally expensive, and the paper does not provide a breakdown of the time spent in each stage. This makes it difficult to assess the practicality of the method for real-world applications. A detailed analysis of the time complexity and memory requirements is missing.\n\n3. The paper does not explore the potential of applying MaskComp to other tasks beyond object completion.

The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of MaskComp. \n3. The paper does not explore the potential of applying MaskComp to other tasks beyond object completion.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe reliance on an off-the-shelf segmentation model is a significant limitation that needs to be addressed. The performance of MaskComp is intrinsically tied to the accuracy of the segmentation model used. If the segmentation model produces noisy or inaccurate masks, the iterative refinement process may not converge to a satisfactory solution, or worse, it may amplify the errors. The paper should include a more thorough analysis of how the choice of segmentation model affects the overall performance of MaskComp. This analysis should include experiments with different segmentation models, varying in accuracy and complexity, to quantify the sensitivity of MaskComp to the quality of the segmentation. Furthermore, the paper should explore strategies to mitigate the impact of segmentation errors, such as incorporating uncertainty estimates from the segmentation model into the mask refinement process or using ensemble methods for segmentation.\n\nRegarding the computational cost, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the time and memory requirements of MaskComp. The iterative nature of the method, involving both generation and segmentation steps, suggests that it could be computationally expensive. The paper should provide a breakdown of the computational cost of each step, including the time taken for mask generation, image generation, and segmentation. This analysis should also compare the computational cost of MaskComp with other object completion methods, such as ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, to provide a clear understanding of its efficiency. Furthermore, the paper should discuss the scalability of MaskComp to larger images and more complex scenes. It would be beneficial to explore potential optimizations to reduce the computational cost, such as using more efficient segmentation models or reducing the number of iterations.\n\nFinally, the paper should explore the potential of applying MaskComp to other tasks beyond object completion. While the current focus is on reconstructing complete objects from partial views, the core idea of iteratively refining masks and using them to guide image generation could be beneficial in other image processing tasks. For example, MaskComp could be applied to image inpainting, where the goal is to fill in missing regions of an image, or to image editing, where the goal is to modify specific regions of an image while preserving the overall structure. The paper should discuss the potential challenges and limitations of applying MaskComp to these other tasks and provide some preliminary experiments to demonstrate its versatility. This would significantly broaden the impact of the paper and highlight the potential of the proposed approach.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease refer to the Weaknesses.\n\n### Rating\n\n6: marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n### Confidence\n\n4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain.

Weakness Statement:\n[My primary concern is that the paper lacks a clear definition of the problem it aims to address. The authors should provide a more precise explanation of the object completion task, particularly regarding the input and expected output. For instance, does the input include only the object mask and image, or does it also encompass the background? What is the specific goal of the completion\u2014should the model generate multiple plausible outputs, or should it aim to recover the original object? In cases where the object is significantly occluded, is it even reasonable to expect the model to recover the original object? The lack of clarity on these points makes it difficult to fully understand the scope and limitations of the proposed method. For example, the paper does not specify how the method would handle scenarios where the occlusion is so severe that the object's shape is largely ambiguous, or if the input mask is noisy or inaccurate. This lack of specificity makes it hard to evaluate the practical applicability of the approach.]\n\n2.

Weakness Statement:\n[The paper does not adequately address how the proposed method handles complex backgrounds. Object completion can be a challenging task, especially when the background is intricate or contains patterns similar to the object itself. The example provided in Figure 7, which involves a human subject, raises questions about the method's ability to handle complex backgrounds effectively. It is unclear how the method would perform in situations where the background contains textures or colors that closely resemble the object, potentially leading to artifacts or incorrect completions.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces MaskComp, a novel approach to object completion that iteratively refines object masks through alternating stages of generation and segmentation. The core idea is that the quality of mask-conditioned generation is heavily influenced by the quality of the conditioned mask. Therefore, MaskComp starts with a partial object mask and iteratively improves it, using the refined mask to guide the generation of a more complete object. The process begins with a partial object and its mask, which are fed into a generative model. The generated image is then segmented to produce an improved mask, and this process is repeated. The authors demonstrate that this iterative combination of generation and segmentation effectively functions as a mask denoiser. The method leverages a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for image generation and an off-the-shelf segmentation model, specifically the Segment Anything Model (SAM), for mask refinement. The authors conduct experiments on two popular datasets, AHP and DYCE, and compare MaskComp against several state-of-the-art methods, including ControlNet and Stable Diffusion. The results show that MaskComp achieves better performance in terms of image quality and object completeness. The paper also includes ablation studies to analyze the impact of different segmentation networks and the robustness of the method to segmentation errors and varying occlusion rates. The authors claim that their method is effective for object completion and has the potential to be applied to other tasks. Overall, the paper presents a technically sound and novel approach to object completion, with promising empirical results. However, there are some limitations that need to be addressed, such as the reliance on an off-the-shelf segmentation model and the lack of a detailed analysis of the computational cost. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, and the figures and tables are helpful in understanding the results. The experiments are comprehensive and convincing, and the authors provide clear explanations of the method and the experiments. The main contribution of the paper is the iterative mask denoising approach, which is simple yet effective, and the idea of iteratively refining the mask through alternating generation and segmentation stages is interesting and has the potential to be applied to other tasks. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the impact of different segmentation networks on the performance of MaskComp, which is a valuable contribution to the field. The authors also explore the robustness of the method to segmentation errors and varying occlusion rates, which is important for real-world applications. The paper is a valuable contribution to the field of object completion and has the potential to be applied to other tasks.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nI find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. The core idea of iteratively refining object masks through alternating generation and segmentation is both novel and technically sound. This approach, which the authors term iterative mask denoising (IMD), is a clever way to leverage the strengths of both generative and segmentation models. The method is relatively simple to implement, yet it yields impressive results, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach. The use of a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for image generation and an off-the-shelf segmentation model (SAM) makes the method accessible and easy to reproduce. The experimental results are compelling, showing that MaskComp outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on two popular datasets. The quantitative evaluations, using metrics like FID, are well-designed and comprehensive, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed method. The qualitative results are also convincing, with visual examples that clearly demonstrate the ability of MaskComp to complete objects more accurately than other methods. Furthermore, the ablation studies are well-executed and provide valuable insights into the impact of different design choices. The authors explore the impact of different segmentation networks, the robustness of the method to segmentation errors, and the performance under varying occlusion rates. These analyses demonstrate the robustness of the method and provide a deeper understanding of its behavior. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the method and the experiments. The figures and tables are well-designed and helpful in understanding the results. Overall, the paper presents a strong contribution to the field of object completion, with a novel and effective method, compelling experimental results, and a thorough analysis of the approach. The iterative nature of the method, combined with the use of pre-trained models, makes it a practical and accessible solution for object completion tasks. The authors have successfully demonstrated the potential of iterative mask refinement for improving generative models, and this work is likely to inspire further research in this area.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile I find the paper to be a strong contribution, there are several weaknesses that I have identified through my analysis. Firstly, the paper relies on an off-the-shelf segmentation model, specifically SAM, which introduces a dependency on the accuracy of this external model. While the paper does include an ablation study comparing SAM with other segmentation models like CLIPSeg and SEEM, this analysis is not sufficiently detailed to fully address the potential limitations. The paper does not explore the impact of segmentation errors on the iterative refinement process. Although the authors show that MaskComp is robust to some segmentation errors, they do not analyze how errors in segmentation propagate through the iterative process and how this impacts the final object completion quality. This is a critical oversight, as the iterative nature of the method means that errors in segmentation could potentially be amplified in subsequent iterations. The paper also lacks a detailed analysis of the computational cost of MaskComp. While the authors provide the inference time for each component, they do not delve into the time complexity or memory requirements of the method. The iterative nature of the process, involving both generation and segmentation steps, suggests that it could be computationally expensive, and the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the time spent in each stage. This makes it difficult to assess the practicality of the method for real-world applications. Furthermore, the paper does not explore the potential of applying MaskComp to other tasks beyond object completion. While the authors mention that the method has the potential to be applied to other tasks, they do not provide any concrete examples or experiments to support this claim. This limits the impact of the paper, as the method could potentially be more widely applicable. The paper also lacks a clear definition of the problem it aims to address. While the authors define the input as the partially visible object, they do not explicitly state whether the background is part of the input or the expected output. The focus seems to be on the object itself, but this could be made clearer. Additionally, the paper does not adequately address how the proposed method handles complex backgrounds. Object completion can be a challenging task, especially when the background is intricate or contains patterns similar to the object itself. The paper lacks a discussion of the potential limitations and failure modes of the method in such scenarios. While the paper shows results on datasets with varying backgrounds, there's no specific analysis or discussion about how the method handles complex backgrounds or potential failure modes related to background complexity. Finally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of MaskComp. While the authors provide the inference time for each component, they do not delve into the time complexity or memory requirements of the method. The iterative nature of the process, involving both generation and segmentation steps, suggests that it could be computationally expensive, and the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the time spent in each stage. This makes it difficult to assess the practicality of the method for real-world applications. These weaknesses, while not invalidating the core contributions of the paper, highlight areas where further research and analysis are needed to fully realize the potential of the proposed method. I have high confidence in these identified weaknesses, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and the lack of specific analyses.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nBased on the weaknesses I have identified, I recommend several concrete improvements for this paper. Firstly, the authors should conduct a more thorough analysis of the impact of the segmentation model's accuracy on the overall performance of MaskComp. This should include experiments using different segmentation models with varying levels of accuracy, and a quantitative analysis of how these differences affect the final object completion quality. Specifically, the authors should explore how errors in segmentation propagate through the iterative process and how this impacts the final result. This analysis should also consider the robustness of the method to segmentation failures, and whether the iterative process can recover from initial segmentation errors. The authors should also investigate the sensitivity of the method to different segmentation model architectures and training data. Furthermore, the paper needs a detailed analysis of the computational cost of MaskComp. This should include a breakdown of the time spent in each stage of the iterative process, as well as an analysis of the memory requirements. The authors should also compare the computational cost of MaskComp to other object completion methods. This analysis should also consider the scalability of the method to larger images and more complex scenes. The authors should also explore potential optimizations to reduce the computational cost of the method, such as using more efficient generation and segmentation models, or reducing the number of iterations required for convergence. A discussion of the trade-off between computational cost and performance would also be beneficial. Additionally, the authors should explore the potential of applying MaskComp to other tasks beyond object completion. This could include tasks such as image inpainting, scene completion, or 3D object reconstruction. The authors should provide concrete examples and experiments to demonstrate the applicability of the method to these other tasks. This would significantly broaden the impact of the paper and highlight the versatility of the proposed approach. The authors should also discuss the potential challenges and limitations of applying MaskComp to these other tasks, and how these challenges could be addressed. The authors should also provide a more precise explanation of the object completion task, particularly regarding the input and expected output. This should include a clear explanation of whether the input consists solely of the object and its mask, or if the background is also considered. Furthermore, the authors need to specify the expected behavior of the model when dealing with heavily occluded objects or noisy masks. For example, they could define the method's behavior in cases where only 20% of the object is visible, or when the input mask has a certain percentage of error. It would also be beneficial to discuss the method's limitations and provide examples of scenarios where the method might fail. This would help to set realistic expectations for the performance of the proposed approach. The authors should also clarify whether the goal is to recover the original object or to generate a plausible completion, and how this is handled in the training process. To improve the discussion of the method's performance with complex backgrounds, the authors should include a more thorough analysis of how the method handles different types of backgrounds. This could involve testing the method on a variety of datasets with varying background complexities, and reporting the results separately for each type. The authors should also discuss the potential for the method to confuse object boundaries with similar patterns in the background, and how this issue is addressed. For example, they could analyze the impact of background complexity on the quality of the completed object, and provide examples of both successful and unsuccessful cases. It would be beneficial to include a quantitative analysis of the method's performance on images with complex backgrounds, such as those with cluttered scenes or textures similar to the object. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's strengths and limitations. Finally, the authors should consider including a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the iterative mask denoising process. While the method is described as simple, the iterative nature of the process may introduce significant computational overhead. The authors should provide a quantitative analysis of the time and memory requirements of the method, and compare it to other object completion techniques. This would help to evaluate the practical applicability of the method in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, the authors could explore potential optimizations to reduce the computational cost of the method, such as using more efficient segmentation models or reducing the number of iterations. This would make the method more accessible and useful for a wider range of applications.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are important for further understanding and development of this work. Firstly, how does the choice of segmentation model affect the overall performance of MaskComp? While the paper includes an ablation study comparing different segmentation models, I am curious if the authors have explored the impact of using segmentation models with significantly different architectures or training data. Specifically, have they considered using segmentation models that are trained on datasets that are different from the object completion datasets used in this paper? This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's robustness to segmentation errors. Secondly, what is the computational cost of MaskComp compared to other object completion methods? The paper provides the inference time for each component, but I am interested in a more detailed analysis of the time complexity and memory requirements of the method. How does the computational cost scale with the size of the input image and the number of iterations? Is the method scalable to larger images and more complex scenes? Thirdly, can MaskComp be applied to other tasks beyond object completion? While the authors mention that the method has the potential to be applied to other tasks, I am curious about the specific challenges and limitations of applying MaskComp to tasks such as image inpainting, scene completion, or 3D object reconstruction. What modifications would be necessary to adapt the method to these other tasks? Fourthly, what is the impact of the initial mask quality on the performance of MaskComp? The paper explores the robustness to segmentation errors, but I am curious about the impact of the initial mask quality on the convergence of the iterative process. How does the method perform when the initial mask is significantly different from the ground truth mask? Finally, how does the method handle complex backgrounds? The paper shows results on datasets with varying background complexities, but I am curious about the potential limitations and failure modes of the method in such scenarios. How does the method perform when the background contains textures or colors that closely resemble the object? These questions are crucial for a deeper understanding of the method's capabilities and limitations, and I believe that addressing them would significantly strengthen the paper.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n5.75\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n4.0\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nAccept\n}", "pred_best_mode": {"step1_output": "I will use Best Mode for comprehensive thinking.

Next, I will not stop my thinking, and I will conduct a detailed analysis of the entire paper:\n\n\\boxed_analysis{\nThis paper introduces MaskComp, a novel approach to object completion that iteratively refines the mask of a partially visible object through alternating generation and segmentation. The core idea is that by progressively improving the mask, the quality of the completed object will also improve. This is a compelling approach, especially given the recent advancements in generative models and segmentation techniques.\n\nThe problem of object completion, or amodal completion, has long been a challenge in computer vision. While early approaches relied on geometric reasoning or simple texture synthesis, the advent of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks, brought significant progress. More recently, generative models like GANs and diffusion models have enabled more realistic and context-aware completion. However, a key limitation of these methods is the lack of explicit shape guidance, which can lead to unrealistic or inconsistent completions. This paper builds upon the success of conditional generation, recognizing the importance of mask information for guiding the completion process. The authors effectively position their work within this context, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the potential of their proposed approach.\n\nThe central challenge in object completion is inferring the complete shape and appearance of an object from its partial observation. This is inherently ambiguous, as multiple plausible completions might exist. The motivation for this work stems from the observation that the quality of the mask directly impacts the quality of the generated completion. This is a crucial insight, as it highlights a key limitation of current methods that primarily focus on generating content based on partial visibility. The real-world implications of robust object completion are significant, ranging from image editing and virtual reality to autonomous driving and robotic manipulation. The paper's focus on leveraging mask information to guide the generative process is a valuable contribution to this field.\n\nThe core concept of MaskComp is the Iterative Mask Denoising (IMD) process. The theoretical foundation lies in the idea that a partial mask can be viewed as a noisy version of the complete mask. The novelty lies in the iterative refinement of this mask through alternating generation and segmentation stages. The logical structure is sound: a better mask leads to a better generation, and the generated image can be used to improve the mask. The conceptual framework is coherent, with each stage playing a specific role in the overall process. A potential theoretical limitation could be the assumption that the segmentation model always provides a better mask than the previous iteration, especially in early stages or with highly occluded objects.\n\nThe methodology is well-defined, with two main stages: generation and segmentation. The generation stage uses CompNet, based on ControlNet, to generate complete objects conditioned on the partial object and its mask. The gating operation, which adjusts the importance of the condition based on the diffusion step, is a clever design choice to handle the evolving mask quality. The auxiliary path for predicting the complete mask from the partial token is a crucial component that encourages the encoder to learn shape information. The specific loss function, combining Dice and BCE loss, is a standard approach for mask prediction. The segmentation stage leverages an off-the-shelf segmentation model to refine the mask based on the generated images. The voting process to aggregate the masks is a simple yet effective way to obtain a more robust estimate. The threshold parameter is a critical hyperparameter that needs careful tuning. The iterative nature of the IMD process is the core of the method, with the number of steps and the number of sampled images being key hyperparameters. The assumption is that this iterative process will converge to a more accurate mask and a more realistic completion.\n\nThe experimental design is thorough, with several experiments designed to evaluate different aspects of MaskComp. The quantitative evaluation on AHP and DYCE datasets, using FID scores and user studies, is appropriate for evaluating the quality and realism of the generated images. The comparison with strong baselines like ControlNet and Stable Diffusion provides a good benchmark. The ablation studies on mask conditions and occlusion rates are crucial for understanding the robustness of the method. The comparison with an amodal segmentation baseline directly addresses the core idea of the paper. The experiments on the impact of different segmentation networks highlight the importance of the segmentation component. The inference time analysis provides practical insights into the computational cost. The robustness to segmentation errors is a critical evaluation of the method's resilience. The visualization of the IMD process offers qualitative insights into the iterative refinement. Overall, the experimental design is comprehensive and well-justified.\n\nThe results consistently demonstrate the superiority of MaskComp over the baselines in terms of both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. The lower FID scores indicate that MaskComp generates more realistic and complete objects. The user study results further support this conclusion. The ablation studies provide strong evidence for the importance of the iterative mask denoising process and the effectiveness of the method under varying occlusion rates. The comparison with the amodal segmentation baseline highlights the advantage of the iterative refinement approach. The analysis of different segmentation networks suggests that while the choice of segmentation model matters, the overall framework is robust. The inference time analysis reveals a trade-off between accuracy and speed. The robustness to segmentation errors demonstrates the resilience of the IMD process. The visualization of the IMD process provides intuitive evidence of the progressive refinement. The generalizability of the results is supported by the evaluation on two different datasets. A potential limitation is the computational cost associated with the iterative process.\n\nThis paper effectively connects the theoretical idea of iterative mask refinement with a practical implementation. The research implications are significant, offering a novel approach to object completion that leverages the strengths of both generative and segmentation models. Future directions could explore more sophisticated mask refinement techniques, adaptive iteration strategies, and integration with other vision tasks. The practical applications are numerous, including advanced image editing tools, improved scene understanding in autonomous systems, and enhanced virtual and augmented reality experiences. The societal impact could be significant in areas like content creation and accessibility. The long-term implications involve a shift towards more interactive and iterative approaches to image generation and manipulation.\n\nWhile the paper presents a compelling approach, there are areas for further improvement. The assumption that segmentation always improves the mask needs further theoretical justification, especially in challenging scenarios. The convergence properties of the IMD process could be analyzed more formally. The choice of the voting mechanism and the threshold parameter could be explored further. The reliance on an off-the-shelf segmentation model means the performance is inherently limited by the capabilities of that model. The computational cost of the iterative process is a significant practical limitation. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of failure cases and scenarios where the method struggles. The evaluation could be expanded to include more diverse object categories and occlusion types. The need for paired training data is a significant practical hurdle. Exploring unsupervised or self-supervised approaches for mask refinement could be a valuable direction. Investigating the theoretical connections between diffusion models and iterative refinement processes could lead to more principled designs. Exploring adaptive gating mechanisms or more sophisticated mask fusion techniques could improve performance. Investigating the use of uncertainty estimates from the segmentation model to guide the refinement process could be beneficial. Conducting more extensive ablation studies on the number of iterations and sampled images would provide a more granular understanding of their impact. Including metrics that specifically measure the accuracy of the completed mask would be valuable. Comparing against a wider range of state-of-the-art object completion methods would strengthen the evaluation. Developing techniques to reduce the computational cost of the iterative process is crucial for practical applications. Exploring ways to make the method more robust to noisy or inaccurate initial masks would increase its applicability. Exploring the application of the IMD framework to other conditional generation tasks beyond object completion could be a promising direction. Optimizing the implementation of CompNet and the segmentation stage could improve inference speed. Exploring the use of MaskComp in robotics for object manipulation or in medical imaging for completing occluded anatomical structures could be interesting avenues. Investigating the integration of MaskComp with interactive image editing tools could enhance user experience. Exploring techniques like model distillation or knowledge pruning to reduce the model size and inference time could be beneficial. Investigating the scalability of the IMD process to higher-resolution images and more complex scenes is important for real-world applications.}\n\nNow, please tell me the answers to the three questions from the recent search.", "questions": ["How have traditional image segmentation methods evolved over the years, and what are the key technical advancements that have contributed to their improved performance in various tasks such as semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation?", "What are the primary challenges and limitations of using conditional image generation techniques, such as those based on diffusion models, for tasks that require high fidelity and diversity in generated images?", "In the context of object completion, how have previous methods addressed the issue of generating realistic and comprehensive object shapes, and what are the common strategies used to handle occlusions and partial visibility?"], "retrieval": [{"final_passages": "[0] Title: Mask-Transformer-Based Networks for Teeth Segmentation in Panoramic Radiographs Text: Teeth segmentation plays a pivotal role in dentistry by facilitating accurate diagnoses and aiding the development of effective treatment plans. While traditional methods have primarily focused on teeth segmentation, they often fail to consider the broader oral tissue context. This paper proposes a panoptic-segmentation-based method that combines the results of instance segmentation with semantic segmentation of the background. Particularly, we introduce a novel architecture for instance teeth segmentation that leverages a dual-path transformer-based network, integrated with a panoptic quality (PQ) loss function. The model directly predicts masks and their corresponding classes, with the PQ loss function streamlining the training process. Our proposed architecture features a dual-path transformer block that facilitates bi-directional communication between the pixel path CNN and the memory path. It also contains a stacked decoder block that aggregates multi-scale features across different decoding resolutions. The transformer block integrates pixel-to-memory feedback attention, pixel-to-pixel self-attention, and memory-to-pixel and memory-to-memory self-attention mechanisms. The output heads process features to predict mask classes, while the final mask is obtained by multiplying memory path and pixel path features. When applied to the UFBA-UESC Dental Image dataset, our model exhibits a substantial improvement in segmentation performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of performance and robustness. Our research signifies an essential step forward in teeth segmentation and contributes to a deeper understanding of oral structures.\n[1] Title: OFFSED: Off-Road Semantic Segmentation Dataset Text: : Over the last decade, improvements in neural networks have facilitated substantial advancements in automated driver assistance systems. In order to manage navigating its surroundings reliably and autonomously, self-driving vehicles need to be able to infer semantic information of the environment. Large parts of the research corpus focus on private passenger cars and cargo trucks, which share the common environment of paved roads, highways and cities. Industrial vehicles like tractors or excavators however make up a substantial share of the total number of motorized vehicles globally while operating in fundamentally different environments. In this paper, we present an extension to our previous Off-Road Pedestrian Detection Dataset (OPEDD) that extends the ground truth data of 203 images to full image semantic segmentation masks which assign one of 19 classes to every pixel. The selection of images was done in a way that captures the whole range of environments and human poses depicted in the original dataset. In addition to pixel labels, a few selected countable classes also come with instance identi\ufb01ers. This allows for the use of the dataset in instance and panoptic segmentation tasks.\n[2] Title: Panoptic Segmentation on Panoramic Radiographs: Deep Learning-Based Segmentation of Various Structures Including Maxillary Sinus and Mandibular Canal Text: Panoramic radiographs, also known as orthopantomograms, are routinely used in most dental clinics. However, it has been difficult to develop an automated method that detects the various structures present in these radiographs. One of the main reasons for this is that structures of various sizes and shapes are collectively shown in the image. In order to solve this problem, the recently proposed concept of panoptic segmentation, which integrates instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, was applied to panoramic radiographs. A state-of-the-art deep neural network model designed for panoptic segmentation was trained to segment the maxillary sinus, maxilla, mandible, mandibular canal, normal teeth, treated teeth, and dental implants on panoramic radiographs. Unlike conventional semantic segmentation, each object in the tooth and implant classes was individually classified. For evaluation, the panoptic quality, segmentation quality, recognition quality, intersection over union (IoU), and instance-level IoU were calculated. The evaluation and visualization results showed that the deep learning-based artificial intelligence model can perform panoptic segmentation of images, including those of the maxillary sinus and mandibular canal, on panoramic radiographs. This automatic machine learning method might assist dental practitioners to set up treatment plans and diagnose oral and maxillofacial diseases.\n[3] Title: Find it if you can: end-to-end adversarial erasing for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation Text: Semantic segmentation is a task that traditionally requires a large dataset of pixel-level ground truth labels, which is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Recent advancements in the weakly-supervised setting show that reasonable performance can be obtained by using only image-level labels. Classification is often used as a proxy task to train a deep neural network from which attention maps are extracted. However, the classification task needs only the minimum evidence to make predictions, hence it focuses on the most discriminative object regions. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel formulation of adversarial erasing of the attention maps. In contrast to previous adversarial erasing methods, we optimize two networks with opposing loss functions, which eliminates the requirement of certain suboptimal strategies; for instance, having multiple training steps that complicate the training process or a weight sharing policy between networks operating on different distributions that might be suboptimal for performance. The proposed solution does not require saliency masks, instead it uses a regularization loss to prevent the attention maps from spreading to less discriminative object regions. Our experiments on the Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate that our adversarial approach increases segmentation performance by 2.1 mIoU compared to our baseline and by 1.0 mIoU compared to previous adversarial erasing approaches.\n[4] Title: High Quality Entity Segmentation Text: Dense image segmentation tasks (e.g., semantic, panoptic) are useful for image editing, but existing methods can hardly generalize well in an in-the-wild setting where there are unrestricted image domains, classes, and image resolution & quality variations. Motivated by these observations, we construct a new entity segmentation dataset, with a strong focus on high-quality dense segmentation in the wild. The dataset contains images spanning diverse image domains and entities, along with plentiful high-resolution images and high-quality mask annotations for training and testing. Given the high-quality and -resolution nature of the dataset, we propose CropFormer which is designed to tackle the intractability of instance-level segmentation on high-resolution images. It improves mask prediction by fusing high-res image crops that provides more fine-grained image details and the full image. CropFormer is the first query-based Transformer architecture that can effectively fuse mask predictions from multiple image views, by learning queries that effectively associate the same entities across the full image and its crop. With CropFormer, we achieve a significant AP gain of 1.9 on the challenging entity segmentation task. Furthermore, CropFormer consistently improves the accuracy of traditional segmentation tasks and datasets. The dataset and code are released at http://luqi.info/entityv2.github.io/.\n[5] Title: Image Segmentation in Foundation Model Era: A Survey Text: Image segmentation is a long-standing challenge in computer vision, studied continuously over several decades, as evidenced by seminal algorithms such as N-Cut, FCN, and MaskFormer. With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion of open issues and potential avenues for future research. We envisage that this fresh, comprehensive, and systematic survey catalyzes the evolution of advanced image segmentation systems. A public website is created to continuously track developments in this fast advancing field: \\url{https://github.com/stanley-313/ImageSegFM-Survey}.\n[6] Title: COCONut: Modernizing COCO Segmentation Text: In recent decades, the vision community has witnessed remarkable progress in visual recognition, partially owing to advancements in dataset benchmarks. Notably, the established COCO benchmark has propelled the development of modern detection and segmentation systems. How-ever, the COCO segmentation benchmark has seen compar-atively slow improvement over the last decade. Originally equipped with coarse polygon annotations for \u2018thing\u2019 in-stances, it gradually incorporated coarse superpixel anno-tations for \u2018stuff\u2019 regions, which were subsequently heuris-tically amalgamated to yield panoptic segmentation anno-tations. These annotations, executed by different groups of raters, have resulted not only in coarse segmentation masks but also in inconsistencies between segmentation types. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive reeval-uation of the COCO segmentation annotations. By enhancing the annotation quality and expanding the dataset to encompass 383K images with more than 5.18M panoptic masks, we introduce COCONut, the COCO Next Universal segmenTation dataset. COCONut harmonizes segmentation annotations across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation with meticulously crafted high-quality masks, and establishes a robust benchmark for all segmentation tasks. To our knowledge, COCONut stands as the inaugural large-scale universal segmentation dataset, verified by hu-man raters. We anticipate that the release of COCONut will significantly contribute to the community's ability to assess the progress of novel neural networks.\n[7] Title: Building Critical Testing Scenarios for Autonomous Driving from Real Accidents Text: One of the aims of the development and spread of autonomous driving technology is to reduce traffic accidents caused by human factors. But recently reported data on fatal accidents involving autonomous driving system (ADS) shows that this important goal has not been achieved. So there is an emerge requirement on more comprehensive and targeted testing especially on safe driving. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically building critical testing scenarios from real-world accident data. Firstly, we propose a new model called M-CPS (Multi-channel Panoptic Segmentation) to extract the effective information from the accident record (such as images or videos), and separate the independent individuals of different traffic participants for further scene recovery. Compared with the traditional panoramic segmentation models, M-CPS model is able to effectively handle segmentation challenges due to the shooting angle, image quality, pixel overlap and other problems existing in the accident record. Next, the extracted core information is then connected with the virtual testing platform to generate the original scene set. Besides, we also design a mutation testing solution on the basis of the original scene set, thus greatly enriching the scene library for testing. In our experiments, the M-CPS model reaches a result of 66.1% PQ on CityScapes test set, shows that our model has only slight fluctuations on performance compared with the best benchmark model on pure panoptic segmentation task. It also reaches a result of 84.5% IoU for semantic segmentation branch and 40.3% mAP for instance segmentation branch on SHIFT dataset. Then we use UCF-Crime, CADP and US-Accidents datasets to generate the original and mutated scene set. Those generated scene sets are connected to Apollo and Carla simulation platforms to test ADS prototypes. We find three types of scenarios that can lead to accidents of ADS prototypes, which indicates that the existing ADS prototype has defects. Our solution provides a new possible direction for the recovery of key scenarios in ADS testing, and can improve the efficiency in related fields.\n[8] Title: OMG-Seg: Is One Model Good Enough for all Segmentation? Text: In this work, we address various segmentation tasks, each traditionally tackled by distinct or partially unified models. We propose OMG-Seg, One Model that is Good enough to efficiently and effectively handle all the segmentation tasks, including image semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, as well as their video counterparts, open vocabulary settings, prompt-driven, interactive segmentation like SAM, and video object segmentation. To our knowledge, this is the first model to handle all these tasks in one model and achieve satisfactory performance. We show that OMG-Seg, a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with task-specific queries and outputs, can support over ten distinct segmentation tasks and yet significantly reduce computational and parameter overhead across various tasks and datasets. We rigorously evaluate the inter-task influences and correlations during co-training. Code and models are available at https://github.com/lxtGH/OMG-Seg.\n[9] Title: Video Panoptic Segmentation Text: Panoptic segmentation has become a new standard of visual recognition task by unifying previous semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks in concert. In this paper, we propose and explore a new video extension of this task, called video panoptic segmentation. The task requires generating consistent panoptic segmentation as well as an association of instance ids across video frames. To invigorate research on this new task, we present two types of video panoptic datasets. The first is a re-organization of the synthetic VIPER dataset into the video panoptic format to exploit its large-scale pixel annotations. The second is a temporal extension on the Cityscapes val. set, by providing new video panoptic annotations (Cityscapes-VPS). Moreover, we propose a novel video panoptic segmentation network (VPSNet) which jointly predicts object classes, bounding boxes, masks, instance id tracking, and semantic segmentation in video frames. To provide appropriate metrics for this task, we propose a video panoptic quality (VPQ) metric and evaluate our method and several other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented two datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art results in image PQ on Cityscapes and also in VPQ on Cityscapes-VPS and VIPER datasets.\n", "keywords": " traditional image segmentation, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation, technical advancements in image segmentation", "output": "Traditional image segmentation methods have undergone significant evolution over the years, with advancements in various technical aspects contributing to improved performance in tasks such as semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. \n\nOne key advancement has been the introduction of deep learning-based methods, which have led to substantial improvements in segmentation performance [5].

In contrast, Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation, aiming to generate realistic and complex scene images from user-specified layouts, has risen to prominence. However, existing methods transform layout information into tokens or RGB images for conditional control in the generative process, leading to insufficient spatial and semantic controllability of individual instances. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Spatial-Semantic Map Guided (SSMG) diffusion model that adopts the feature map, derived from the layout, as guidance. Owing to rich spatial and semantic information encapsulated in well-designed feature maps, SSMG achieves superior generation quality with sufficient spatial and semantic controllability compared to previous works. Additionally, we propose the Relation-Sensitive Attention (RSA) and Location-Sensitive Attention (LSA) mechanisms. The former aims to model the relationships among multiple objects within scenes while the latter is designed to heighten the model's sensitivity to the spatial information embedded in the guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSMG achieves highly promising results, setting a new state-of-the-art across a range of metrics encompassing fidelity, diversity, and controllability.\n[1] Title: DiffuseVAE: Efficient, Controllable and High-Fidelity Generation from Low-Dimensional Latents Text: Diffusion probabilistic models have been shown to generate state-of-the-art results on several competitive image synthesis benchmarks but lack a low-dimensional, interpretable latent space, and are slow at generation. On the other hand, standard Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically have access to a low-dimensional latent space but exhibit poor sample quality. We present DiffuseVAE, a novel generative framework that integrates VAE within a diffusion model framework, and leverage this to design novel conditional parameterizations for diffusion models. We show that the resulting model equips diffusion models with a low-dimensional VAE inferred latent code which can be used for downstream tasks like controllable synthesis. The proposed method also improves upon the speed vs quality tradeoff exhibited in standard unconditional DDPM/DDIM models (for instance, FID of 16.47 vs 34.36 using a standard DDIM on the CelebA-HQ-128 benchmark using T=10 reverse process steps) without having explicitly trained for such an objective. Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits synthesis quality comparable to state-of-the-art models on standard image synthesis benchmarks like CIFAR-10 and CelebA-64 while outperforming most existing VAE-based methods. Lastly, we show that the proposed method exhibits inherent generalization to different types of noise in the conditioning signal. For reproducibility, our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/kpandey008/DiffuseVAE.\n[2] Title: Cascaded Diffusion Models for High Fidelity Image Generation Text: We show that cascaded diffusion models are capable of generating high fidelity images on the class-conditional ImageNet generation benchmark, without any assistance from auxiliary image classifiers to boost sample quality. A cascaded diffusion model comprises a pipeline of multiple diffusion models that generate images of increasing resolution, beginning with a standard diffusion model at the lowest resolution, followed by one or more super-resolution diffusion models that successively upsample the image and add higher resolution details. We find that the sample quality of a cascading pipeline relies crucially on conditioning augmentation, our proposed method of data augmentation of the lower resolution conditioning inputs to the super-resolution models. Our experiments show that conditioning augmentation prevents compounding error during sampling in a cascaded model, helping us to train cascading pipelines achieving FID scores of 1.48 at 64x64, 3.52 at 128x128 and 4.88 at 256x256 resolutions, outperforming BigGAN-deep, and classification accuracy scores of 63.02% (top-1) and 84.06% (top-5) at 256x256, outperforming VQ-VAE-2.\n[3] Title: Kaleido Diffusion: Improving Conditional Diffusion Models with Autoregressive Latent Modeling Text: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. Despite their successes, these models often exhibit limited diversity in the sampled images, particularly when sampling with a high classifier-free guidance weight. To address this issue, we present Kaleido, a novel approach that enhances the diversity of samples by incorporating autoregressive latent priors. Kaleido integrates an autoregressive language model that encodes the original caption and generates latent variables, serving as abstract and intermediary representations for guiding and facilitating the image generation process. In this paper, we explore a variety of discrete latent representations, including textual descriptions, detection bounding boxes, object blobs, and visual tokens. These representations diversify and enrich the input conditions to the diffusion models, enabling more diverse outputs. Our experimental results demonstrate that Kaleido effectively broadens the diversity of the generated image samples from a given textual description while maintaining high image quality. Furthermore, we show that Kaleido adheres closely to the guidance provided by the generated latent variables, demonstrating its capability to effectively control and direct the image generation process.\n[4] Title: Diverse Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Image Synthesis With Diffusion Models Text: Hyperspectral image (HSI) synthesis overcomes the limitations of imaging sensors and enables low-cost acquisition of HSIs with high spatial resolution. Using RGB as a conditional input for hyperspectral generation is promising and valuable, as it can leverage abundant existing multispectral/RGB images without the intervention of hyperspectral sensors. However, most existing generation methods follow one-to-one mapping frameworks and ignore generation diversity. In addition, the current evaluation metrics of hyperspectral generation are based on the similarity with the reference image, which cannot reflect the diversity of the generated spectra. In this article, we propose a novel method for diverse hyperspectral remote sensing image generation based on the diffusion model. The diffusion model uses a denoising model to gradually remove noise from the normal distribution and generates the hyperspectral data step-by-step with the conditional RGB image as input. To address the high-dimensional noise prediction problem caused by a large number of bands in the HSI, we introduce a conditional vector quantized generative adversarial network (VQGAN) that maps the high-dimensional hyperspectral data into a low-dimensional latent space and conduct the diffusion process in the latent space. The latent-diffusion process makes the diffusion process faster and more stable. The conditional VQGAN decodes HSIs from the latent code generated by diffusion, with the conditional RGB image as the input, which restricts the diversity to a specific object distribution. We also designed two new metrics to evaluate the generation spectral diversity (SD). Experiments on the IEEE grss_dfc_2018 dataset demonstrate that our method can synthesize highly diverse hyperspectral data. In addition, the rationality of the proposed metrics is also verified.\n[5] Title: Conditioning Diffusion Models via Attributes and Semantic Masks for Face Generation Text: Deep generative models have shown impressive results in generating realistic images of faces. GANs managed to generate high-quality, high-fidelity images when conditioned on semantic masks, but they still lack the ability to diversify their output. Diffusion models partially solve this problem and are able to generate diverse samples given the same condition. In this paper, we propose a multi-conditioning approach for diffusion models via cross-attention exploiting both attributes and semantic masks to generate high-quality and controllable face images. We also studied the impact of applying perceptual-focused loss weighting into the latent space instead of the pixel space. Our method extends the previous approaches by introducing conditioning on more than one set of features, guaranteeing a more fine-grained control over the generated face images. We evaluate our approach on the CelebA-HQ dataset, and we show that it can generate realistic and diverse samples while allowing for fine-grained control over multiple attributes and semantic regions. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to evaluate the impact of different conditioning strategies on the quality and diversity of the generated images.\n[6] Title: CADS: Unleashing the Diversity of Diffusion Models through Condition-Annealed Sampling Text: While conditional diffusion models are known to have good coverage of the data distribution, they still face limitations in output diversity, particularly when sampled with a high classifier-free guidance scale for optimal image quality or when trained on small datasets. We attribute this problem to the role of the conditioning signal in inference and offer an improved sampling strategy for diffusion models that can increase generation diversity, especially at high guidance scales, with minimal loss of sample quality. Our sampling strategy anneals the conditioning signal by adding scheduled, monotonically decreasing Gaussian noise to the conditioning vector during inference to balance diversity and condition alignment. Our Condition-Annealed Diffusion Sampler (CADS) can be used with any pretrained model and sampling algorithm, and we show that it boosts the diversity of diffusion models in various conditional generation tasks. Further, using an existing pretrained diffusion model, CADS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.70 and 2.31 for class-conditional ImageNet generation at 256$\\times$256 and 512$\\times$512 respectively.\n[7] Title: Conditional Distribution Modelling for Few-Shot Image Synthesis with Diffusion Models Text: Few-shot image synthesis entails generating diverse and realistic images of novel categories using only a few example images. While multiple recent efforts in this direction have achieved impressive results, the existing approaches are dependent only upon the few novel samples available at test time in order to generate new images, which restricts the diversity of the generated images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Conditional Distribution Modelling (CDM) -- a framework which effectively utilizes Diffusion models for few-shot image generation. By modelling the distribution of the latent space used to condition a Diffusion process, CDM leverages the learnt statistics of the training data to get a better approximation of the unseen class distribution, thereby removing the bias arising due to limited number of few shot samples. Simultaneously, we devise a novel inversion based optimization strategy that further improves the approximated unseen class distribution, and ensures the fidelity of the generated samples to the unseen class. The experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CDM for few-shot generation.\n[8] Title: CoDi: Conditional Diffusion Distillation for Higher-Fidelity and Faster Image Generation Text: Large generative diffusion models have revolution-ized text-to-image generation and offer immense po-tential for conditional generation tasks such as im-age enhancement, restoration, editing, and compositing. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the high computational cost, which limits their real-time application. To address this challenge, we in-troduce a novel method dubbed CoDi, that adapts a pre-trained latent diffusion model to accept additional image conditioning inputs while significantly reducing the sampling steps required to achieve high-quality results. Our method can leverage architectures such as ControlNet to incorporate conditioning inputs with-out compromising the model's prior knowledge gained during large scale pre-training. Additionally, a con-ditional consistency loss enforces consistent predictions across diffusion steps, effectively compelling the model to generate high-quality images with conditions in a few steps. Our conditional-task learning and distil-lation approach outperforms previous distillation meth-ods, achieving a new state-of-the-art in producing high-quality images with very few steps (e.g., 1\u20134) across multiple tasks, including super-resolution, text-guided image editing, and depth-to-image generation.\n[9] Title: UNIMO-G: Unified Image Generation through Multimodal Conditional Diffusion Text: Existing text-to-image diffusion models primarily generate images from text prompts. However, the inherent conciseness of textual descriptions poses challenges in faithfully synthesizing images with intricate details, such as specific entities or scenes. This paper presents UNIMO-G, a simple multimodal conditional diffusion framework that operates on multimodal prompts with interleaved textual and visual inputs, which demonstrates a unified ability for both text-driven and subject-driven image generation. UNIMO-G comprises two core components: a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for encoding multimodal prompts, and a conditional denoising diffusion network for generating images based on the encoded multimodal input. We leverage a two-stage training strategy to effectively train the framework: firstly pre-training on large-scale text-image pairs to develop conditional image generation capabilities, and then instruction tuning with multimodal prompts to achieve unified image generation proficiency. A well-designed data processing pipeline involving language grounding and image segmentation is employed to construct multi-modal prompts. UNIMO-G excels in both text-to-image generation and zero-shot subject-driven synthesis, and is notably effective in generating high-fidelity images from complex multimodal prompts involving multiple image entities.\n", "keywords": " conditional image generation, diffusion models, high fidelity image generation, image diversity, limitations of diffusion models", "output": "Conditional image generation techniques, including those based on diffusion models, have made significant progress in generating high-quality images from various inputs, such as text descriptions, semantic masks, and attributes [0][3][5]. However, these models still face several challenges and limitations, particularly when it comes to achieving high fidelity and diversity in generated images [3][6][7].\n\nOne of the primary challenges is the limited ability to control the generation process, leading to a lack of diversity in the output images [3]. This is particularly evident when sampling with a high classifier-free guidance weight, resulting in limited diversity in the generated images [3].

Existing methods require either complete point clouds or multiple partial observations of the same object for learning. In contrast to previous approaches, we present Partial2Complete (P2C), the first self-supervised framework that completes point cloud objects using training samples consisting of only a single incomplete point cloud per object. Specifically, our framework groups incomplete point clouds into local patches as input and predicts masked patches by learning prior information from different partial objects. We also propose Region-Aware Chamfer Distance to regularize shape mismatch without limiting completion capability, and devise the Normal Consistency Constraint to incorporate a local planarity assumption, encouraging the recovered shape surface to be continuous and complete. In this way, P2C no longer needs multiple observations or complete point clouds as ground truth. Instead, structural cues are learned from a category-specific dataset to complete partial point clouds of objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic ShapeNet data and real-world ScanNet data, showing that P2C produces comparable results to methods trained with complete shapes, and outperforms methods learned with multiple partial observations.

In our approach, symmetry detection is formulated as a constrained sparsity maximization problem, which is solved efficiently using a robust RANSAC\u2010based optimizer. The detected partial symmetries are then reused iteratively, in order to complete the missing parts of the object. A global error relaxation method minimizes the accumulated alignment errors and a non\u2010rigid registration approach applies local deformations in order to properly handle approximate symmetry. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not rely on the computation of features, it uniformly handles translational, rotational and reflectional symmetries and can provide plausible object completion results, even on challenging cases, where more than half of the target object is missing. We demonstrate our algorithm in the completion of 3D scans with varying levels of partiality and we show the applicability of our approach in the repair and completion of heavily eroded or incomplete cultural heritage objects.\n[2] Title: AnchorFormer: Point Cloud Completion from Discriminative Nodes Text: Point cloud completion aims to recover the completed 3D shape of an object from its partial observation. A common strategy is to encode the observed points to a global feature vector and then predict the complete points through a generative process on this vector. Nevertheless, the results may suffer from the high-quality shape generation problem due to the fact that a global feature vector cannot sufficiently characterize diverse patterns in one object. In this paper, we present a new shape completion architecture, namely AnchorFormer, that innovatively leverages pattern-aware discriminative nodes, i.e., anchors, to dynamically capture regional information of objects. Technically, AnchorFormer models the regional discrimination by learning a set of anchors based on the point features of the input partial observation. Such anchors are scattered to both observed and unobserved locations through estimating particular offsets, and form sparse points together with the down-sampled points of the input observation. To reconstruct the finegrained object patterns, AnchorFormer further employs a modulation scheme to morph a canonical 2D grid at individual locations of the sparse points into a detailed 3D structure. Extensive experiments on the PCN, ShapeNet-55/34 and KITTI datasets quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the efficacy of AnchorFormer over the state-of-the-art point cloud completion approaches.

In previous work, the amodal segmentation ground truth on real images is usually pre-dicted by manual annotaton and thus is subjective. In contrast, we use 3D data to establish an automatic pipeline to determine authentic ground truth amodal masks for partially occluded objects in real images. This pipeline is used to construct an amodal completion evaluation benchmark, MP3D-Amodal, consisting of a variety of object categories and la-bels. To better handle the amodal completion task in the wild, we explore two architecture variants: a two-stage model that first infers the occluder, followed by amodal mask completion; and a one-stage model that exploits the representation power of Stable Diffusion for amodal segmentation across many categories. Without bells and whistles, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on Amodal segmentation datasets that cover a large variety of objects, in-cluding COCOA and our new MP3D-Amodal dataset. The dataset, model, and code are available at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/amodal/\n[4] Title: SeedFormer: Patch Seeds based Point Cloud Completion with Upsample Transformer Text: Point cloud completion has become increasingly popular among generation tasks of 3D point clouds, as it is a challenging yet indispensable problem to recover the complete shape of a 3D object from its partial observation. In this paper, we propose a novel SeedFormer to improve the ability of detail preservation and recovery in point cloud completion. Unlike previous methods based on a global feature vector, we introduce a new shape representation, namely Patch Seeds, which not only captures general structures from partial inputs but also preserves regional information of local patterns. Then, by integrating seed features into the generation process, we can recover faithful details for complete point clouds in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover, we devise an Upsample Transformer by extending the transformer structure into basic operations of point generators, which effectively incorporates spatial and semantic relationships between neighboring points. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art completion networks on several benchmark datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/hrzhou2/seedformer.\n[5] Title: ShapeFormer: Transformer-based Shape Completion via Sparse Representation Text: We present ShapeFormer, a transformer-based network that produces a distribution of object completions, conditioned on incomplete, and possibly noisy, point clouds. The resultant distribution can then be sampled to generate likely completions, each exhibiting plausible shape details while being faithful to the input. To facilitate the use of transformers for 3D, we introduce a compact 3D representation, vector quantized deep implicit function (VQDIF), that utilizes spatial sparsity to represent a close approximation of a 3D shape by a short sequence of discrete variables. Experiments demonstrate that ShapeFormer outperforms prior art for shape completion from ambiguous partial inputs in terms of both completion quality and diversity. We also show that our approach effectively handles a variety of shape types, incomplete patterns, and real-world scans.\n[6] Title: Amodal Completion via Progressive Mixed Context Diffusion Text: Our brain can effortlessly recognize objects even when partially hidden from view. Seeing the visible of the hidden is called amodal completion; however, this task remains a challenge for generative AI despite rapid progress. We propose to sidestep many of the difficulties of existing approaches, which typically involve a two-step process of predicting amodal masks and then generating pixels. Our method involves thinking outside the box, literally! We go outside the object bounding box to use its context to guide a pretrained diffusion inpainting model, and then progressively grow the occluded object and trim the extra background. We overcome two technical challenges: 1) how to be free of unwanted co-occurrence bias, which tends to regenerate similar occluders, and 2) how to judge if an amodal completion has succeeded. Our amodal completion method exhibits improved photorealistic completion results compared to existing approaches in numerous successful completion cases. And the best part? It doesn't require any special training or fine-tuning of models.\n[7] Title: Active Visuo-Haptic Object Shape Completion Text: Recent advancements in object shape completion have enabled impressive object reconstructions using only visual input. However, due to self-occlusion, the reconstructions have high uncertainty in the occluded object parts, which negatively impacts the performance of downstream robotic tasks such as grasping. In this work, we propose an active visuo-haptic shape completion method called Act-VH that actively computes where to touch the objects based on the reconstruction uncertainty. Act-VH reconstructs objects from point clouds and calculates the reconstruction uncertainty using IGR, a recent state-of-the-art implicit surface deep neural network. We experimentally evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of Act-VH against five baselines in simulation, for which we propose a new simulation environment, and in the real world. The results show that Act-VH outperforms all baselines and that an uncertainty-driven haptic exploration policy leads to higher reconstruction accuracy than a random policy and a policy driven by Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces. As a final experiment, we evaluate Act-VH and the best reconstruction baseline on grasping 10 novel objects. The results show that Act-VH reaches a significantly higher grasp success rate than the baseline on all objects. Together, this work opens up the door for using active visuo-haptic shape completion in more complex cluttered scenes.\n[8] Title: From Reassembly to Object Completion: A Complete Systems Pipeline Text: The problem of the restoration of broken artifacts, where large parts could be missing, is of high importance in archaeology. The typical manual restoration can become a tedious and error-prone process, which also does not scale well. In recent years, many methods have been proposed for assisting the process, most of which target specialized object types or operate under very strict constraints. We propose a digital shape restoration pipeline consisting of proven, robust methods for automatic fragment reassembly and shape completion of generic three-dimensional objects of arbitrary type. In this pipeline, first we introduce a novel unified approach for handling the reassembly of objects from heavily damaged fragments by exploiting both fracture surfaces and salient features on the intact sides of fragments, when available. Second, we propose an object completion procedure based on generalized symmetries and a complementary part extraction process that is suitable for driving the fabrication of missing geometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using real-world fractured objects and software implemented as part of the European Union--funded PRESIOUS project, which is also available for download from the project site.\n[9] Title: 3DSGrasp: 3D Shape-Completion for Robotic Grasp Text: Real-world robotic grasping can be done robustly if a complete 3D Point Cloud Data (PCD) of an object is available. However, in practice, PCDs are often incomplete when objects are viewed from few and sparse viewpoints before the grasping action, leading to the generation of wrong or inaccurate grasp poses. We propose a novel grasping strategy, named 3DSGrasp, that predicts the missing geometry from the partial PCD to produce reliable grasp poses. Our proposed PCD completion network is a Transformer-based encoder-decoder network with an Offset-Attention layer. Our network is inherently invariant to the object pose and point's permutation, which generates PCDs that are geometrically consistent and completed properly. Experiments on a wide range of partial PCD show that 3DSGrasp outperforms the best state-of-the-art method on PCD completion tasks and largely improves the grasping success rate in real-world scenarios.

Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of MaskComp over existing approaches, \\eg, ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, establishing it as an effective solution for object completion.\n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\n\\def\\tabdesignchoice#1{\n\\begin{table*}[#1]\n\t\\centering\n \t\\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{Segmentation model}.\n\t\\label{tab:segm model}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.25\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n\t\t\t\t\t\\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n\t\t\t\t\t\\begin{tabular}{l|ccc}\n                        Model & CLIPSeg & SEEM & SAM \\\\ [.1em]\n                        \\shline\n\t\t\t\t\tFID & 19.9 & 18.1 & 16.9\\\\\n                    \\end{tabular}\n\t\t\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n\t}\n\t\\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{IMD step number}.\n\t\\label{tab:step number}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.25\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n    \\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|ccccc}\n        $T$ & 1 & 3 & 5 & 7 \\\\ [.1em]\n        \\shline\n        FID & 24.7 & 19.4 & 16.9 & 16.1  \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n}\n\\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{\\# of sampled images}.\n\t\\label{tab:image number}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\centering\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.25\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n    \\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|ccc}\n        N & 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\ [.1em]\n        \\shline\n    FID & 17.4 & 16.9 & 16.8 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n\t\t\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n\t}\n    \\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{Condition gating}.\n\t\\label{tab:gating}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.2\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n\t\t\t\t\t\\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n\t\t\t\t\t\\begin{tabular}{l|cccc}\n                        Gating & \\Checkmark & \\XSolidBrush \\\\ [.1em]\n                        \\shline\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFID & 16.9 & 18.2\\\\\n                    \\end{tabular}\n\t\t\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n\t}\n\t\\caption{\\textbf{Design choices for IMD on AHP dataset.} We ablate (a) the impact of different segmentation networks, (b) IMD step number, (c) the number of sampled images in the segmentation stage, and (d) the gating operation in the CompNet.}\n\t\\label{tab:design choices}\n\\end{table*}}\n\\def\\tableablation#1{\n\\begin{table*}[#1]\n\t\\centering\n\t\\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{Conditioned mask}.\n\t\\label{tab:conditioned mask}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.25\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n    \\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|ccccc}\n        Mask & Partial & Intermed. & Complete \\\\ [.1em]\n        \\shline\n        FID & 16.9 & 15.3 & 12.7   \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n}\n\t\\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{Occlusion rate}.\n\t\\label{tab:occ}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.27\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n\t\t\t\t\t\\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n\t\t\t\t\t\\begin{tabular}{l|cccc}\n                        Occ. & 20\\% & 40 \\% & 60 \\% & 80\\%\\\\ [.1em]\n                        \\shline\n\t\t\t\t\tFID & 13.4 & 15.7 & 17.2 & 29.9\\\\\n                    \\end{tabular}\n\t\t\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n\t}\n \\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{Inference time}.\n\t\\label{tab:time}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\centering\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.2\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n    \\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|ccc}\n        Comp. & Gen. & Segm. & Total \\\\ [.1em]\n        \\shline\n    Second &  14.3 & 1.2 & 15.5 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n\t\t\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n\t}\n  \\subfloat[\n\t\\textbf{Amodal baseline}.\n\t\\label{tab:amodal}\n\t]{\n\t\t\\centering\n\t\t\\begin{minipage}{0.25\\linewidth}{\\begin{center}\n    \\tablestyle{1.5pt}{1.2}\n    \\begin{tabular}{l|ccc}\n        Model & Baseline & MaskComp \\\\ [.1em]\n        \\shline\n    FID & 29.4 & 16.9 \\\\\n    \\end{tabular}\n\t\t\\end{center}}\\end{minipage}\n\t}\n\t\\caption{\\textbf{Ablation of MaskComp on AHP dataset}.

Recent breakthroughs in image generation techniques have delivered impressive results across various image editing tasks, including image inpainting \\citep{Xie_2023_CVPR}, composition \\citep{yang2023paint} and colorization \\citep{Chang_2023_CVPR}. However, another intriguing challenge lies in the domain of object completion (\\cref{fig:teaser0}). This task involves the restoration of partially occluded objects within an image, representing the image as a layered stack of objects and background, which can potentially enable a number of more complicated editing tasks such as object layer switching. Unlike other conditional generation tasks, \\eg, image inpainting, which only generates and integrates complete objects into images, object completion requires seamless alignment between the generated content and the given partial object, which imposes more challenges to recover realistic and comprehensive object shapes.\n \nTo guide the generative model in producing images according to a specific shape, additional conditions can be incorporated \\citep{Koley_2023_CVPR,Yang_2023_CVPR}. Image segmentation has been shown to be a critical technique for enhancing the realism and stability of generative models by providing pixel-level guidance during the synthesis process. Recent research, as exemplified in the latest study by Zhang et al. \\citep{zhang2023adding}, showcases that, by supplying object segmentations as additional high-quality masks for shaping the objects, it becomes possible to generate complex images of remarkable fidelity.\nIn this paper, we present MaskComp, a novel approach that bridges image generation and segmentation for effective object completion. MaskComp is rooted in a fundamental observation: the quality of the resulting image in the mask-conditioned generation is directly influenced by the quality of the conditioned mask \\citep{zhang2023adding}. That says the more detailed the conditioned mask, the more realistic the generated image. \nBased on this observation, unlike prior object completion methods that solely rely on partially visible objects for generating complete objects, MaskComp introduces an additional mask condition combined with an iterative mask denoising (IMD) process, progressively refining the incomplete mask to provide comprehensive shape guidance to object completion.\n\nOur approach formulates the partial mask as a noisy form of the complete mask and the IMD process is designed to iteratively denoise this noisy partial mask, eventually leading to the attainment of the complete mask. As illustrated in \\cref{fig:teaser}, each IMD step comprises two crucial stages: generation and segmentation. The generation stage's objective is to produce complete object images conditioning on the visible portion of the target object and an object mask. Meanwhile, the segmentation stage is geared towards segmenting the object mask within the generated images and aggregating these segmented masks to obtain a superior mask that serves as the condition for the subsequent IMD step. By seamlessly integrating the generation and segmentation stages, we demonstrate that each IMD step effectively operates as a mask-denoising mechanism, taking a partially observed mask as input and yielding a progressively more complete mask as output. Consequently, through this iterative mask denoising process, the originally incomplete mask evolves into a satisfactory complete object mask, enabling the generation of complete objects guided by this refined mask.\n\nThe effectiveness of MaskComp is demonstrated by its capacity to address scenarios involving heavily occluded objects and its ability to generate realistic object representations through the utilization of mask guidance. In contrast to recent progress in the field of image generation research, our contributions can be succinctly outlined as follows:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We explore and unveil the benefits of incorporating object masks into the object completion task. A novel approach, MaskComp, is proposed to seamlessly bridge the generation and segmentation.\n    \n    \\item We formulate the partial mask as a form of noisy complete mask and introduce an iterative mask denoising (IMD) process, consisting of alternating generation and segmentation stages, to refine the object mask and thus improve the object completion. \n    \n    \\item We conduct extensive experiments for analysis and comparison, the results of which indicate the strength and robustness of MaskComp against previous methods, \\eg, Stable Diffusion. \n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\\section{Related Works}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Conditional image generation.}\nConditional image generation \\cite{lee2022autoregressive,gafni2022make,li2023gligen} involves the process of creating images based on specific conditions. These conditions can take various forms, such as layout \\citep{li2020bachgan,sun2019image,zhao2019image}, sketch \\citep{Koley_2023_CVPR}, or semantic masks \\citep{gu2019mask}. For instance, Cascaded Diffusion Models \\citep{ho2022cascaded} utilize ImageNet class labels as conditions, employing a two-stage pipeline of multiple diffusion models to generate high-resolution images. Meanwhile, in the work by \\citep{sehwag2022generating}, diffusion models are guided to produce novel images from low-density regions within the data manifold. Another noteworthy approach is CLIP \\citep{radford2021clip}, which has gained widespread adoption in guiding image generation in GANs using text prompts \\citep{galatolo2021generating, gal2022stylegan, zhou2021lafite}. In the realm of diffusion models, Semantic Diffusion Guidance \\citep{liu2023more} explores a unified framework for diffusion-based image generation with language, image, or multi-modal conditions. Dhariwal et al. \\citep{dhariwal2021diffusion} employ an ablated diffusion model that utilizes the gradients of a classifier to guide the diffusion process, balancing diversity and fidelity. Furthermore, Ho et al. \\citep{ho2022classifier} introduce classifier-free guidance in conditional diffusion models, incorporating score estimates from both a conditional diffusion model and a jointly trained unconditional diffusion model. \n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Object segmentation.}\nIn the realm of segmentation, traditional approaches have traditionally leaned on domain-specific network architectures to tackle various segmentation tasks, including semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation \\citep{fcn, deeplabv1, mask-rcnn, spatial-instance, associate-instance, solo, panoptic-deeplab, max-deeplab, li2023towards,li2023panoramic,li2023robust,li2023rethinking,li2023paintseg,li2022video,li2022hybrid}. However, recent strides in transformer-based methodologies, have highlighted the effectiveness of treating these tasks as mask classification challenges \\citep{maskformer, knet, mask2former, detr}. MaskFormer \\citep{maskformer} and its enhanced variant \\citep{mask2former} have introduced transformer-based architectures, coupling each mask prediction with a learnable query. Unlike prior techniques that learn semantic labels at the pixel level, they directly link semantic labels with mask predictions through query-based prediction. Notably, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) \\citep{kirillov2023segment} represents a cutting-edge segmentation model that accommodates diverse visual and textual cues for zero-shot object segmentation. Similarly, SEEM \\citep{zou2023segment} is another universal segmentation model that extends its capabilities to include object referencing through audio and scribble inputs. By leveraging those foundation segmentation models, \\eg, SAM and SEEM, a number of downstream tasks can be boosted \\citep{ma2023segment,cen2023segment,yu2023inpaint}.\n\n\n\n\\section{MaskComp}\n\n\\label{sec:IMD}\n\n\\subsection{Problem Definition and Key Insight}\nWe address the object completion task, wherein the objective is to predict the image of a complete object $I_c\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times H\\times W}$, based on its visible (non-occluded) part $I_p\\in\\mathbb{R}^{3\\times H\\times W}$. \n\nWe first discuss the high-level idea of the proposed \\textbf{I}terative \\textbf{M}ask \\textbf{D}enoising (IMD) and then illustrate the module details in \\cref{sec:object completion} and \\cref{sec:object segmentation}. The core of IMD is based on an essential observation: In the mask-conditioned generation, the quality of the generated object is intricately tied to the quality of the conditioned mask. As shown in \\cref{fig:mask_condition}, we visualize the completion result of the same partial object but with different conditioning masks. We notice a more complete object mask condition will result in a more complete and realistic object image. \nBased on this observation, high-quality occluded object completion can be achieved by providing a complete object mask as the condition.\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/mask_condition.pdf}\n\\caption{Object completion with different mask conditions.}\n\\label{fig:mask_condition}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering    \n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/pipeline.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Illustration of CompNet (generation stage of MaskComp).} The CompNet aims to recover the complete object $I_c$ from the partial object $I_p$ and a mask $M$. An object encoder is utilized to extract partial token $c_p$ which is gated and fed to the ControlNet to form the complete token $c_c$. The complete token $c_c$ serves as the condition to the diffusion U-Net to guide the conditional denoising process. In addition, a pre-diffusion mask is predicted from the partial token to encourage the object encoder to capture shape information.}\n    \\label{fig:pipeline}\n\\end{figure*}\n\\subsection{Iterative Mask Denoising}\nHowever, in real-world scenarios, the complete object mask is not available. To address this problem, we propose the IMD process which leverages intertwined generation and segmentation processes to approach the partial mask to the complete mask gradually. \nGiven a partially visible object $I_p$ and its corresponding partial mask $M_p$, the conventional object completion task aims to find a generative model $\\mathcal{G}$ such that $I_c\\leftarrow\\mathcal{G}(I_p)$, where $I_c$ is the complete object. Here, we additionally add the partial mask $M_p$ to the condition  $I_c\\leftarrow\\mathcal{G}(I_p, M_p)$, where $M_p$ can be assumed as an addition of the complete mask and a noise $M_p=M_c+\\Delta$. By introducing a segmentation model $\\mathcal{S}$, we can find a mask denoiser $\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}$ from the object completion model:\n\\begin{equation}\nM_c\\leftarrow\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}(I_p, M_c+\\Delta)\n\\label{equ:mask denoiser}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $M_c=\\mathcal{S}(I_c)$.\nStarting from the visible mask $M_0=M_p$, as shown in \\cref{fig:teaser}, we repeatedly apply the mask denoiser $\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}$ to gradually approach the visible mask $M_p$ to complete mask $M_c$. In each step, the input mask is denoised with a stack of generation and segmentation stages. Specifically, as the $\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}(\\cdot)$ includes a generative process, we can obtain a set of estimations of denoised mask $\\{M_t^{(k)}\\}$. Here, we utilize a function $\\mathcal{V}(\\cdot)$ to find a more complete and reasonable mask from the $N$ sampled masks and leverage it as the input mask for the next iteration to further denoise. The updating rule can be written as:\n\\begin{equation}\nM_{t}^{(k)}=\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}(I_p,\\hat{M}_{t-1}),\\,\\,\\,\n\\hat{M_t}=\\mathcal{V}(M_t^{(1)},\\cdots,M_t^{(N)})\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $N$ is the number of sampled images in each iteration. With a satisfactory complete mask $\\hat{M}_T$ after $T$ iterations, the object completion can be achieved accordingly by $\\mathcal{G}(I_p,\\hat{M}_T)$. The mathematical explanation of the process will be discussed in \\cref{sec:discussion}. \n\n\n\\subsection{Generation Stage}\n\\label{sec:object completion}\nWe introduce \\textbf{\\textsl{CompNet}} as the generative model $\\mathcal{G}$ which aims to recover complete objects based on partial conditions. We build CompNet based on popular ControlNet \\cite{zhang2023adding} while making fundamental modifications to enable object completion. As shown in \\cref{tab:form diff}, the target of ControlNet is to generate images strictly based on the given conditions, \\ie, $I_p\\leftarrow\\mathcal{G}(I_p,M_p)$, making it unable to complete object. Differently, CompNet is designed to recover the object. With a segmentation network, it can act as a mask denoiser to refine the conditioned mask, \\ie, $M_c\\leftarrow\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}(I_p,M_p)$.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\scalebox{0.77}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{c|ccc}\n    \\hline\n    Method  & Objective & Objective with Segm. &  Object Comp.\\\\\n    \\hline\n    ControlNet & $I_p\\leftarrow\\mathcal{G}(I_p,M_p)$ & $M_p\\leftarrow\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}(I_p,M_p)$ & \\textcolor{red}{\\XSolidBrush}\\\\\n    CompNet & $I_c\\leftarrow\\mathcal{G}(I_p,M_p)$ & $M_c\\leftarrow\\mathcal{S}\\circ\\mathcal{G}(I_p,M_p)$ & \\textcolor{mygreen}{\\Checkmark}\\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\end{tabular}}\n    \\caption{Objective difference with ControlNet.}\n    \\label{tab:form diff}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Mask condition.}\nAs illustrated on the left side of \\cref{fig:pipeline}, we begin with a complete object $I_c$ and its corresponding mask $M_c$. Our approach commences by occluding the complete object, retaining only the partially visible portion as $I_p$. Recall that the mask-denoising procedure initiates with the partial mask $M_p$ and culminates with the complete mask $M_c$. To facilitate this iterative denoising, the model must effectively handle any mask that falls within the interpolation between the initial partial mask and the target complete mask. Consequently, we introduce a mask $M$ with an occlusion rate positioned between the partial and complete masks as a conditioning factor for the generative model. The partial mask $M_p$ is achieved by considering the occluded areas in both occlusion processes. The interpolated mask $M$ is generated by using one of the occlusions. \n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Diffusion model.}\nDiffusion models have achieved notable progress in synthesizing unprecedented image quality and have been successfully applied to many text-based image generation works \\citep{rombach2022high,zhang2023adding}. For our object completion task, the complete object can be generated by leveraging the diffusion process.\n\nSpecifically, the diffusion model generates image latent $x$ by gradually reversing a Markov forward process. As shown in Figure~\\ref{fig:pipeline}, starting from $x_0=\\mathcal{E}(I_c)$, the forward process yields a sequence of increasing noisy tokens $\\{x_\\tau|\\tau\\in[1,T_{\\mathcal{G}}]\\}$, where $x_\\tau=\\sqrt{\\Bar{\\alpha_\\tau}}y_0+\\sqrt{1-\\Bar{\\alpha_\\tau}}\\epsilon$, $\\epsilon$ is the Gaussian noise, and $\\alpha_\\tau$ decreases with the timestep $\\tau$. For the denoising process, the diffusion model progressively denoises a noisy token from the last step given the conditions $c=(I_p,M,E)$ by minimizing the following loss function: $\\mathcal{L}=\\mathbb{E}_{\\tau,x_0,\\epsilon}\\|\\epsilon_\\theta(x_\\tau,c,\\tau)-\\epsilon\\|_2^2$. $I_p$, $M$, and $E$ are the partial object, conditioned mask, and text prompt respectively.\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering    \n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/mask.pdf}\n    \\caption{\n    We calculate the mask probability map by averaging and normalizing the masks of sampled images. We show a cross-section of the lower leg to better visualize (shown as \\textcolor{darkyellow}{yellow}). \n    }\n    \\label{fig:mask}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{CompNet architecture.}\nPrevious work \\citep{zhang2023adding} has demonstrated an effective way to add additional control to generative diffusion models. We follow this architecture and make necessary modifications to adapt the architecture to object completion. As shown in \\cref{fig:pipeline}, given the visible object $I_p$ and the conditioning mask $M$, we first concatenate them and extract the partial token $c_p$ with an object encoder. \nDifferent from ControlNet \\citep{zhang2023adding} assuming the condition is accurate, the object completion task relies on incomplete conditions. Specifically, in the early diffusion steps, the condition information is vital to complete the object. Nevertheless, in the later steps, inaccurate information in the condition can degrade the generated object. To tackle this problem, we introduce a time-variant gating operation to adjust the importance of conditions in the diffusion steps. We learn a linear transform $f: \\mathbb{R}^{C}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}^{1}$ upon the time embedding $e_t\\in\\mathbb{R}^{C}$ and then apply it to the partial token as $f(e_t)\\cdot c_p$ before feeding it to the ControlNet. In this way, the importance of visible features can be adjusted as the diffusion steps forward. The time embedding used for the gating operation is shared with the time embedding for encoding the diffusion step in the stable diffusion.\n\nTo encourage the object encoder to capture shape information, we introduce an auxiliary path to predict the complete object mask from the partial token $c_p$. Specifically, a feature pyramid network \\cite{lin2017feature} is leveraged as the mask decoder which takes $c_p$ and the multi-scale features from the object encoder as input and outputs a pre-diffusion mask $M_{pre}$. We encourage mask completion with supervision as\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\mathcal{L}_{mask}=\\mathcal{L}_{dice}(M_c,M_{pre})+\\lambda_{ce}\\mathcal{L}_{ce}(M_c,M_{pre})\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{dice}$ and $\\mathcal{L}{ce}$ are Dice loss \\cite{li2019dice} and BCE loss respectively. $\\lambda_{ce}$ is a constant.\n\n\\subsection{Segmentation Stage}\n\\label{sec:object segmentation}\nIn the segmentation stage, illustrated in \\cref{fig:mask} (a), our approach initiates by sampling $N$ images denoted as $\\{I_t^{(k)}\\}^N_{k=1}$ from the generative model, where $t$ is the IMD step. Subsequently, we employ an off-the-shelf object segmentation model denoted as $\\mathcal{S}(\\cdot)$ to obtain the shapes (object masks) $\\{M_t^{(k)}\\}$ from these sampled images.\n\nTo derive an improved mask for the subsequent IMD step, we seek a function $\\mathcal{V}(\\cdot)$ that can produce a high-quality mask prediction from the set of $N$ generated masks. Interestingly, though the distribution of sampled images is complex, we notice the distribution of masks has good properties.\nIn \\cref{fig:mask} (b), we provide a visualization of the probability map associated with a set of object masks with the same conditions, which is computed by taking the normalized average of the masks.\nTo enhance the visualization of this probability distribution, we focus on a specific cross-section of the fully occluded portion in image $I_p$ (the lower leg, represented as a \\textcolor{darkyellow}{yellow} section) and visualize the probability as a function of the horizontal coordinate which demonstrates an obvious unimodal and symmetric property. Leveraging this observation, we can find an improved mask by taking the high-probability region. \nThe updating can be achieved by conducting a voting process across the $N$ estimated masks, as defined by the following equation:\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\hat{M}_t[i,j] = \\begin{cases}\n                1, & \\text{if}\\quad \\frac{\\sum_{k=1}^NM_t^{(k)}[i,j]}{N} \\geq \\tau \\\\\n                0, & \\text{otherwise}\n        \\end{cases}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $[i,j]$ denotes the coordinate, and $\\tau$ is the threshold employed for the mask voting process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\centering   \n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/dist.pdf}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Mutual-benificial sampling.}}\n\\label{fig:mutual}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\begin{table*}[t]\n\\centering\n\\scalebox{0.9}{\n\\begin{tabular}{l|p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}|p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}p{1.4cm}<{\\centering}} \n\\hline\n\\multirow{2}*{Method} & \\multicolumn{4}{c|}{AHP \\citep{zhou2021human}} &\n\\multicolumn{4}{c}{DYCE \\citep{ehsani2018segan}}\\\\\n\\cline{2-9}\n~ & FID-G $\\downarrow$ & FID-S $\\downarrow$ & Rank $\\downarrow$ & Best $\\uparrow$ & FID-G $\\downarrow$ & FID-S $\\downarrow$ & Rank $\\downarrow$ & Best $\\uparrow$\\\\\n\\hline\nControlNet & 40.2 & 45.4 & 3.4 & 0.10 & 42.4 & 49.4 & 3.4 & 0.08 \\\\\nKandinsky 2.1 & 43.9 & 39.2 & 3.2 & 0.11 & 44.3 & 47.7 &  3.4 & 0.06 \\\\\nStable Diffusion 1.5 & 35.7 & 41.4 & 3.2 & 0.12 & 31.2 & 43.4 & 3.4 & 0.11 \\\\\nStable Diffusion 2.1 & 30.8 & 39.9 & 3.1 & 0.14 & 30.0 & 41.1 & 3.0 & 0.12 \\\\\n\\bf MaskComp (Ours) & \\bf16.9 & \\bf21.3 &\\bf2.1 & \\bf0.53 & \\bf 20.0 & \\bf25.4 & \\bf1.9 & \\bf0.63  \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}}\n\\caption{\\textbf{Quantitative evaluation on object completion task}.

Instead, it necessitates the more challenging joint modeling of objects and masks, denoted as $p(I,M)$, where the images and masks can range from partial to complete. Let us understand the joint distribution by exploring its marginals. Since the relation between mask and image is one-to-many (each object image only has one mask while the same mask can be segmented from multiple images), the $p(M|I)$ is actually a Dirac delta distribution $\\delta$ and only the $p(I|M)$ is a real distribution. This way, the joint distribution of mask and image is discrete and complex, making the modeling difficult. To address this issue, we introduce a slack condition to the joint distribution $p(I,M)$ that \\textit{the mask and image can follow a many-to-many relation}, which makes its marginal $p(M|I)$ a real distribution and permits $p(I|M)$ to predict image $I$ that has a different shape as the conditioned $M$ and vice versa. \n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/compare.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Qualitative comparison against ControlNet, Kandinsky and Stable Diffusion}. The background is filtered out for better visualization.}\n    \\label{fig:compare}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Mutual-beneficial sampling.}\nAfter discussing the joint distribution that we are targeting, we introduce the mathematical explanation of MaskComp. MaskComp introduces the alternating modeling of two marginal distributions $p(I|M)$ (generation stage) and $p(M|I)$ (segmentation stage), which is actually a Markov Chain Monte Carlo-like (MCMC-like) process and more specifically Gibbs sampling-like. It samples the joint distribution $p(I,M)$ by iterative sampling from the marginal distributions. Two core insights are incorporated in MaskComp: (1) providing a mask as a condition can effectively enhance object generation and (2) fusing the mask of generated object images can result in a more accurate and complete object mask. Based on these insights, we train CompNet to maximize $p(I|M)$ and leverage mask voting to maximize the $p(M|I)$. As shown in \\cref{fig:mutual}, MaskComp develops a mutual-beneficial sampling process from the joint distribution $p(I,M)$, where the object mask is provided to boost the image generation and, in return, the generated images can lead to a more accurate mask by fusing the segmentation of images. Through alternating sampling from the marginal distributions, we can effectively address the object completion task.\n\n\n\n\\section{Experiment}\n\n\\subsection{Experimental Settings}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Dataset.}\nWe evaluate MaskComp on two popular datasets: AHP \\citep{zhou2021human} and DYCE \\citep{ehsani2018segan}. \nAHP is an amodal human perception dataset with 56,302 images with annotations of integrated humans.\nDYCE is a synthetic dataset with photo-realistic images and the natural configuration of objects in indoor scenes.\nFor both datasets, the non-occluded object and its corresponding mask for each object are available. We train MaskComp on the AHP and a filtered subset of OpenImage v6 \\citep{kuznetsova2020open}. OpenImage is a large-scale dataset offering heterogeneous annotations. We select a subset of OpenImage that contains 429,358 objects as a training set of MaskComp.\n\\tableablation{t}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Evaluation metrics.}\nIn accordance with previous methods \\citep{zhou2021human}, we evaluate image generation quality Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID). The background is removed with object masks before evaluation. \nAs the FID score cannot reflect the object completeness, we further conduct a user study, leveraging human assessment to compare the quality and completeness of images. During the assessment, given a partial object, the participants are required to rank the generated object from different methods based on their completeness and quality.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Implementation details.}\nFor the generation stage, we train the CompNet with frozen Stable Diffusion \\citep{rombach2022high} on the AHP dataset for 50 epochs. The learning rate is set for 1e-5. We adopt $\\mathrm{batchsize}=8$ and an Adam \\citep{loshchilov2017adamw} optimizer. \nThe image is resized to $512\\times 512$ for both training and inference. \nThe object is cropped and resized to have the longest side 360 before sticking on the image. \nFor a more generalized setting, we train the CompNet on a subset of the OpenImage \\citep{kuznetsova2020open} dataset for 36 epochs. We generate text prompts using BLIP \\citep{li2022blip} for all experiments (prompts are necessary to train ControlNet). For the segmentation stage, we leverage SAM \\citep{kirillov2023segment} as $\\mathcal{S}(\\cdot)$. We vote mask with a threshold of $\\tau=0.5$. During inference, if no other specification, we conduct the IMD process for 5 steps with $N=5$ images for each step. We give the class label as the text prompt to facilitate the CompNet to effectively generate objects. All baseline methods are given the same text prompts during the experiments. The code will be made publicly available.\n\n\\subsection{Main Results}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Quantitative results.}\nWe compare the MaskComp with state-of-the-art methods, ControlNet \\citep{zhang2023adding}, Kandinsky 2.1 \\citep{kandinsky2}, Stable Diffusion 1.5 \\citep{rombach2022high} and Stable Diffusion 2.1 \\citep{rombach2022high} on AHP \\citep{zhou2021human} and DYCE \\citep{ehsani2018segan} dataset. The results in \\cref{tab:main results} indicate that MaskComp consistently outperforms other methods, as evidenced by its notably lower FID scores, signifying the superior quality of its generated content. We conducted a user study to evaluate object completeness in which participants ranked images generated by different approaches. MaskComp achieved an impressive average ranking of 2.1 and 1.9 on the AHP and DYCE datasets respectively. Furthermore, MaskComp also generates the highest number of images ranked as the most complete and realistic compared to previous methods. We consider the introduced mask condition and the proposed IMD process benefits the performance of MaskComp, where the additional conditioned mask provides robust shape guidance to the generation process and the proposed iterative mask denoising process refines the initial conditioned mask to a more complete shape, further enhancing the generated image quality.   \n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Qualitative results.}\nWe present visual comparisons among ControlNet, Kandinsky 2.1, Stable Diffusion 1.5, and Stable Diffusion 2.1, illustrated in \\cref{fig:compare}. Our visualizations showcase MaskComp's ability to produce realistic and complete object images given partial images as the condition, whereas previous approaches exhibit noticeable artifacts and struggle to achieve realistic object completion. In addition, without mask guidance, it is common for previous methods to generate images that fail to align with the partial object.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[t]\n    \\centering    \n    \\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{figs/vis_imd.pdf}\n    \\caption{\\textbf{Visualization of the IMD process.} For each step, we randomly demonstrate one generated image and the averaged mask for all generated images. We omit the input mask which has the same shape as the input occluded object.\n    }\n    \\label{fig:vis_imd}\n\\end{figure*}\n\n\\tabdesignchoice{t}\n\n\\subsection{Analysis}\n\\label{sec:analysis}\nIn this section, we provide an experimental analysis of MaskComp. All the results are evaluated with GT masks to filter out the background, \\ie, FID-G.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Performance with different mask conditions.}\nWe evaluated the quality of generated images when conditioned on the same partial images along with three distinct types of masks: (1) partial mask (mask of the partial image), (2) intermediate mask (less occlusion than partial), and (3) complete mask. As shown in \\cref{tab:conditioned mask}, the model achieves its highest performance when it is conditioned with complete object masks, whereas relying solely on partial masks yields less optimal results. These results provide strong evidence that the quality of the conditioned mask significantly influences the quality of the generated images.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Performance with different occlusion rates.}\nWe perform ablation studies to assess the resilience of MaskComp under varying occlusion levels. As presented in \\cref{tab:occ}, we evaluate MaskComp at different occlusion levels (proportion of the obscured area relative to the complete object) ranging from 20\\% to 80\\%, and the results indicate that its performance does not degrade significantly up to 60\\% occlusion.\n\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Inference time.} \\cref{tab:time} reports the inference time of each component in IMD (with a single NVIDIA V100 GPU). Although MaskComp's throughput is reduced due to the inclusion of multiple diffusion processes in each IMD step, it is capable of attaining a higher degree of accuracy in visual object completion. Based on our empirical experiments, reducing the number of diffusion steps during the first few IMD steps can increase model speed without sacrificing much performance. With this idea incorporated into MaskComp, the average running time could be reduced to 2/3 of the original time with FID slightly increasing by 0.50. While beyond the scope of this study, we expect more advanced techniques could be explored to optimize the tradeoff between model speed and performance.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Comparison to amodal segmentation baseline.}\nAmodal segmentation has a similar objective to the proposed IMD process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MaskComp, we construct an amodal baseline that generates amodal masks from the SOTA amodal segmentation method \\cite{tran2022aisformer} and then utilize ControlNet to generate images based on the amodal masks. s shown in \\cref{tab:amodal}, we notice that our method outperforms the amodal baseline by a considerable margin, which could be attributed to the strong mask completion capability of the proposed IMD process.\n\n\\begin{table}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\scalebox{0.95}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{c|ccccc}\n        Noise degree & Iter. 1 & Iter. 3 & Iter. 5 & Iter. 7 & Iter. 9 \\\\\n        \\toprule\n        15\\% area & 28.4 & 22.7 & 18.9 & 17.2 & 16.5 \\\\\n        10\\% area & 26.4 & 21.4 & 18.1 & 17.0 & 16.4 \\\\\n        5\\% area & 24.9 & 19.6 & 17.0 & 16.2 & 16.0 \\\\\n        No noise & 24.7 & 19.4 & 16.9 & 16.1 & 15.9 \n    \\end{tabular}}\n    \\caption{Performance against segmentation errors on AHP dataset.}\n    \\label{tab:robust}\n\\end{table}\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Impact of different segmentation networks.} \nWe adopt SAM to obtain object masks at the segmentation stage. To study the impacts of different segmenters, we replace SAM with two smaller segmentation networks, CLIPSeg \\cite{luddecke2022image} and SEEM \\cite{zou2023segment}. \\cref{tab:segm model} shows that the FID score with CLIPSeg (19.9) is slightly higher than with SAM (16.9), but remains competitive against other state-of-the-art methods, e.g., Stable Diffusion 2.1 (30.8 reported in \\cref{tab:main results}). MaskComp is an iterative mask denoising (IMD) process that progressively refines a partial object mask to boost image generation. The results support our hypothesis that the impact of the segmenter is modest.\n\n\\noindent\\textbf{Design choices in IMD.}\nWe conduct experiments to ablate the design choices in IMD and their impacts on the completion performance. We first study the effect of IMD step number. With a larger step number, IMD can better advance the partial mask to the complete mask. As shown in \\cref{tab:step number}, we notice that the image quality keeps increasing and slows down at a step number of 5. In this way, we choose 5 as our IMD step number. After that, we ablate the number of sampled images in the segmentation stage in \\cref{tab:image number}. We notice more sampled images generally leading to a better performance. We leverage an image number of 5 with the efficiency consideration. As we leverage the diffusion-based method for image generation, we ablate the iterations for the diffusion process. As shown in \\cref{tab:gating}, we notice the gating operation improves the generation quality by 1.3 FID, indicating the necessity of conditional gating.\n\\noindent\\textbf{Robustness to segmentation errors.} \nWe conduct experiments to manually add random errors to masks. As shown in \\cref{tab:robust}, we ablate on the number of iterations and the degree of segmentation error. We observe that segmentation errors will increase the convergence iteration number while not affecting the final performance significantly. As IMD is a reciprocal process intended to provide effective control for later-generated masks to be refined based on adaptive feedback, mask errors are mitigated and not propagated.\n\\noindent\\textbf{Visualization of iterative mask denoising.}\nTo provide a clearer depiction of the IMD process, as depicted in \\cref{fig:vis_imd}, we present visualizations of the generated image and the averaged mask for each step. In the initial step, we observe the emergence of artifacts alongside the object. As we progress through the steps, both the image and mask quality exhibit continuous improvement.\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Conclusion}\n\nIn this paper, we introduce MaskComp, a novel approach for object completion. MaskComp addresses the object completion task by seamlessly integrating conditional generation and segmentation, capitalizing on the crucial observation that the quality of generated objects is intricately tied to the quality of the conditioned masks. We augment the object completion process with an additional mask condition and propose an iterative mask denoising (IMD) process. This iterative approach gradually refines the partial object mask, ultimately leading to the generation of satisfactory objects by leveraging the complete mask as a guiding condition. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of MaskComp, particularly in challenging scenarios involving heavily occluded objects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will use Best Mode for comprehensive thinking.

Next, I will not stop my thinking, and I will conduct a detailed analysis of the entire paper:\n\n\\boxed_analysis{\nThis paper introduces MaskComp, a novel approach to object completion that iteratively refines the mask of a partially visible object through alternating generation and segmentation. The core idea is that by progressively improving the mask, the quality of the completed object will also improve. This is a compelling approach, especially given the recent advancements in generative models and segmentation techniques.\n\nThe problem of object completion, or amodal completion, has long been a challenge in computer vision. While early approaches relied on geometric reasoning or simple texture synthesis, the advent of deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks, brought significant progress. More recently, generative models like GANs and diffusion models have enabled more realistic and context-aware completion. However, a key limitation of these methods is the lack of explicit shape guidance, which can lead to unrealistic or inconsistent completions. This paper builds upon the success of conditional generation, recognizing the importance of mask information for guiding the completion process. The authors effectively position their work within this context, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the potential of their proposed approach.\n\nThe central challenge in object completion is inferring the complete shape and appearance of an object from its partial observation. This is inherently ambiguous, as multiple plausible completions might exist. The motivation for this work stems from the observation that the quality of the mask directly impacts the quality of the generated completion. This is a crucial insight, as it highlights a key limitation of current methods that primarily focus on generating content based on partial visibility. The real-world implications of robust object completion are significant, ranging from image editing and virtual reality to autonomous driving and robotic manipulation. The paper's focus on leveraging mask information to guide the generative process is a valuable contribution to this field.\n\nThe core concept of MaskComp is the Iterative Mask Denoising (IMD) process. The theoretical foundation lies in the idea that a partial mask can be viewed as a noisy version of the complete mask. The novelty lies in the iterative refinement of this mask through alternating generation and segmentation stages. The logical structure is sound: a better mask leads to a better generation, and the generated image can be used to improve the mask. The conceptual framework is coherent, with each stage playing a specific role in the overall process. A potential theoretical limitation could be the assumption that the segmentation model always provides a better mask than the previous iteration, especially in early stages or with highly occluded objects.\n\nThe methodology is well-defined, with two main stages: generation and segmentation. The generation stage uses CompNet, based on ControlNet, to generate complete objects conditioned on the partial object and its mask. The gating operation, which adjusts the importance of the condition based on the diffusion step, is a clever design choice to handle the evolving mask quality. The auxiliary path for predicting the complete mask from the partial token is a crucial component that encourages the encoder to learn shape information. The specific loss function, combining Dice and BCE loss, is a standard approach for mask prediction. The segmentation stage leverages an off-the-shelf segmentation model to refine the mask based on the generated images. The voting process to aggregate the masks is a simple yet effective way to obtain a more robust estimate. The threshold parameter is a critical hyperparameter that needs careful tuning. The iterative nature of the IMD process is the core of the method, with the number of steps and the number of sampled images being key hyperparameters. The assumption is that this iterative process will converge to a more accurate mask and a more realistic completion.\n\nThe experimental design is thorough, with several experiments designed to evaluate different aspects of MaskComp. The quantitative evaluation on AHP and DYCE datasets, using FID scores and user studies, is appropriate for evaluating the quality and realism of the generated images. The comparison with strong baselines like ControlNet and Stable Diffusion provides a good benchmark. The ablation studies on mask conditions and occlusion rates are crucial for understanding the robustness of the method. The comparison with an amodal segmentation baseline directly addresses the core idea of the paper. The experiments on the impact of different segmentation networks highlight the importance of the segmentation component. The inference time analysis provides practical insights into the computational cost. The robustness to segmentation errors is a critical evaluation of the method's resilience. The visualization of the IMD process offers qualitative insights into the iterative refinement. Overall, the experimental design is comprehensive and well-justified.\n\nThe results consistently demonstrate the superiority of MaskComp over the baselines in terms of both quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. The lower FID scores indicate that MaskComp generates more realistic and complete objects. The user study results further support this conclusion. The ablation studies provide strong evidence for the importance of the iterative mask denoising process and the effectiveness of the method under varying occlusion rates. The comparison with the amodal segmentation baseline highlights the advantage of the iterative refinement approach. The analysis of different segmentation networks suggests that while the choice of segmentation model matters, the overall framework is robust. The inference time analysis reveals a trade-off between accuracy and speed. The robustness to segmentation errors demonstrates the resilience of the IMD process. The visualization of the IMD process provides intuitive evidence of the progressive refinement. The generalizability of the results is supported by the evaluation on two different datasets. A potential limitation is the computational cost associated with the iterative process.\n\nThis paper effectively connects the theoretical idea of iterative mask refinement with a practical implementation. The research implications are significant, offering a novel approach to object completion that leverages the strengths of both generative and segmentation models. Future directions could explore more sophisticated mask refinement techniques, adaptive iteration strategies, and integration with other vision tasks. The practical applications are numerous, including advanced image editing tools, improved scene understanding in autonomous systems, and enhanced virtual and augmented reality experiences. The societal impact could be significant in areas like content creation and accessibility. The long-term implications involve a shift towards more interactive and iterative approaches to image generation and manipulation.\n\nWhile the paper presents a compelling approach, there are areas for further improvement. The assumption that segmentation always improves the mask needs further theoretical justification, especially in challenging scenarios. The convergence properties of the IMD process could be analyzed more formally. The choice of the voting mechanism and the threshold parameter could be explored further. The reliance on an off-the-shelf segmentation model means the performance is inherently limited by the capabilities of that model. The computational cost of the iterative process is a significant practical limitation. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of failure cases and scenarios where the method struggles. The evaluation could be expanded to include more diverse object categories and occlusion types. The need for paired training data is a significant practical hurdle. Exploring unsupervised or self-supervised approaches for mask refinement could be a valuable direction. Investigating the theoretical connections between diffusion models and iterative refinement processes could lead to more principled designs. Exploring adaptive gating mechanisms or more sophisticated mask fusion techniques could improve performance. Investigating the use of uncertainty estimates from the segmentation model to guide the refinement process could be beneficial. Conducting more extensive ablation studies on the number of iterations and sampled images would provide a more granular understanding of their impact. Including metrics that specifically measure the accuracy of the completed mask would be valuable. Comparing against a wider range of state-of-the-art object completion methods would strengthen the evaluation. Developing techniques to reduce the computational cost of the iterative process is crucial for practical applications. Exploring ways to make the method more robust to noisy or inaccurate initial masks would increase its applicability. Exploring the application of the IMD framework to other conditional generation tasks beyond object completion could be a promising direction. Optimizing the implementation of CompNet and the segmentation stage could improve inference speed. Exploring the use of MaskComp in robotics for object manipulation or in medical imaging for completing occluded anatomical structures could be interesting avenues. Investigating the integration of MaskComp with interactive image editing tools could enhance user experience. Exploring techniques like model distillation or knowledge pruning to reduce the model size and inference time could be beneficial. Investigating the scalability of the IMD process to higher-resolution images and more complex scenes is important for real-world applications.}\n\nNow, please tell me the answers to the three questions from the recent search."}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Question 1\n\nHow have traditional image segmentation methods evolved over the years, and what are the key technical advancements that have contributed to their improved performance in various tasks such as semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation?\n\n### Passage\n\n[0] Title: Mask-Transformer-Based Networks for Teeth Segmentation in Panoramic Radiographs **--**Text: Teeth segmentation plays a pivotal role in dentistry by facilitating accurate diagnoses and aiding the development of effective treatment plans. While traditional methods have primarily focused on teeth segmentation, they often fail to consider the broader oral tissue context. This paper proposes a panoptic-segmentation-based method that combines the results of instance segmentation with semantic segmentation of the background. Particularly, we introduce a novel architecture for instance teeth segmentation that leverages a dual-path transformer-based network, integrated with a panoptic quality (PQ) loss function. The model directly predicts masks and their corresponding classes, with the PQ loss function streamlining the training process. Our proposed architecture features a dual-path transformer block that facilitates bi-directional communication between the pixel path CNN and the memory path. It also contains a stacked decoder block that aggregates multi-scale features across different decoding resolutions. The transformer block integrates pixel-to-memory feedback attention, pixel-to-pixel self-attention, and memory-to-pixel and memory-to-memory self-attention mechanisms. The output heads process features to predict mask classes, while the final mask is obtained by multiplying memory path and pixel path features. When applied to the UFBA-UESC Dental Image dataset, our model exhibits a substantial improvement in segmentation performance, surpassing existing state-of-the-art techniques in terms of performance and robustness. Our research signifies an essential step forward in teeth segmentation and contributes to a deeper understanding of oral structures.\n[1] Title: OFFSED: Off-Road Semantic Segmentation Dataset **--**Text: : Over the last decade, improvements in neural networks have facilitated substantial advancements in automated driver assistance systems. In order to manage navigating its surroundings reliably and autonomously, self-driving vehicles need to be able to infer semantic information of the environment. Large parts of the research corpus focus on private passenger cars and cargo trucks, which share the common environment of paved roads, highways and cities. Industrial vehicles like tractors or excavators however make up a substantial share of the total number of motorized vehicles globally while operating in fundamentally different environments. In this paper, we present an extension to our previous Off-Road Pedestrian Detection Dataset (OPEDD) that extends the ground truth data of 203 images to full image semantic segmentation masks which assign one of 19 classes to every pixel. The selection of images was done in a way that captures the whole range of environments and human poses depicted in the original dataset. In addition to pixel labels, a few selected countable classes also come with instance identi\ufb01ers. This allows for the use of the dataset in instance and panoptic segmentation tasks.\n[2] Title: Panoptic Segmentation on Panoramic Radiographs: Deep Learning-Based Segmentation of Various Structures Including Maxillary Sinus and Mandibular Canal **--**Text: Panoramic radiographs, also known as orthopantomograms, are routinely used in most dental clinics. However, it has been difficult to develop an automated method that detects the various structures present in these radiographs. One of the main reasons for this is that structures of various sizes and shapes are collectively shown in the image. In order to solve this problem, the recently proposed concept of panoptic segmentation, which integrates instance segmentation and semantic segmentation, was applied to panoramic radiographs. A state-of-the-art deep neural network model designed for panoptic segmentation was trained to segment the maxillary sinus, maxilla, mandible, mandibular canal, normal teeth, treated teeth, and dental implants on panoramic radiographs. Unlike conventional semantic segmentation, each object in the tooth and implant classes was individually classified. For evaluation, the panoptic quality, segmentation quality, recognition quality, intersection over union (IoU), and instance-level IoU were calculated. The evaluation and visualization results showed that the deep learning-based artificial intelligence model can perform panoptic segmentation of images, including those of the maxillary sinus and mandibular canal, on panoramic radiographs. This automatic machine learning method might assist dental practitioners to set up treatment plans and diagnose oral and maxillofacial diseases.\n[3] Title: Find it if you can: end-to-end adversarial erasing for weakly-supervised semantic segmentation **--**Text: Semantic segmentation is a task that traditionally requires a large dataset of pixel-level ground truth labels, which is time-consuming and expensive to obtain. Recent advancements in the weakly-supervised setting show that reasonable performance can be obtained by using only image-level labels. Classification is often used as a proxy task to train a deep neural network from which attention maps are extracted. However, the classification task needs only the minimum evidence to make predictions, hence it focuses on the most discriminative object regions. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel formulation of adversarial erasing of the attention maps. In contrast to previous adversarial erasing methods, we optimize two networks with opposing loss functions, which eliminates the requirement of certain suboptimal strategies; for instance, having multiple training steps that complicate the training process or a weight sharing policy between networks operating on different distributions that might be suboptimal for performance. The proposed solution does not require saliency masks, instead it uses a regularization loss to prevent the attention maps from spreading to less discriminative object regions. Our experiments on the Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate that our adversarial approach increases segmentation performance by 2.1 mIoU compared to our baseline and by 1.0 mIoU compared to previous adversarial erasing approaches.\n[4] Title: High Quality Entity Segmentation **--**Text: Dense image segmentation tasks (e.g., semantic, panoptic) are useful for image editing, but existing methods can hardly generalize well in an in-the-wild setting where there are unrestricted image domains, classes, and image resolution & quality variations. Motivated by these observations, we construct a new entity segmentation dataset, with a strong focus on high-quality dense segmentation in the wild. The dataset contains images spanning diverse image domains and entities, along with plentiful high-resolution images and high-quality mask annotations for training and testing. Given the high-quality and -resolution nature of the dataset, we propose CropFormer which is designed to tackle the intractability of instance-level segmentation on high-resolution images. It improves mask prediction by fusing high-res image crops that provides more fine-grained image details and the full image. CropFormer is the first query-based Transformer architecture that can effectively fuse mask predictions from multiple image views, by learning queries that effectively associate the same entities across the full image and its crop. With CropFormer, we achieve a significant AP gain of 1.9 on the challenging entity segmentation task. Furthermore, CropFormer consistently improves the accuracy of traditional segmentation tasks and datasets. The dataset and code are released at http://luqi.info/entityv2.github.io/.\n[5] Title: Image Segmentation in Foundation Model Era: A Survey **--**Text: Image segmentation is a long-standing challenge in computer vision, studied continuously over several decades, as evidenced by seminal algorithms such as N-Cut, FCN, and MaskFormer. With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion of open issues and potential avenues for future research. We envisage that this fresh, comprehensive, and systematic survey catalyzes the evolution of advanced image segmentation systems. A public website is created to continuously track developments in this fast advancing field: \\url{https://github.com/stanley-313/ImageSegFM-Survey}.\n[6] Title: COCONut: Modernizing COCO Segmentation **--**Text: In recent decades, the vision community has witnessed remarkable progress in visual recognition, partially owing to advancements in dataset benchmarks. Notably, the established COCO benchmark has propelled the development of modern detection and segmentation systems. How-ever, the COCO segmentation benchmark has seen compar-atively slow improvement over the last decade. Originally equipped with coarse polygon annotations for \u2018thing\u2019 in-stances, it gradually incorporated coarse superpixel anno-tations for \u2018stuff\u2019 regions, which were subsequently heuris-tically amalgamated to yield panoptic segmentation anno-tations. These annotations, executed by different groups of raters, have resulted not only in coarse segmentation masks but also in inconsistencies between segmentation types. In this study, we undertake a comprehensive reeval-uation of the COCO segmentation annotations. By enhancing the annotation quality and expanding the dataset to encompass 383K images with more than 5.18M panoptic masks, we introduce COCONut, the COCO Next Universal segmenTation dataset. COCONut harmonizes segmentation annotations across semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation with meticulously crafted high-quality masks, and establishes a robust benchmark for all segmentation tasks. To our knowledge, COCONut stands as the inaugural large-scale universal segmentation dataset, verified by hu-man raters. We anticipate that the release of COCONut will significantly contribute to the community's ability to assess the progress of novel neural networks.\n[7] Title: Building Critical Testing Scenarios for Autonomous Driving from Real Accidents **--**Text: One of the aims of the development and spread of autonomous driving technology is to reduce traffic accidents caused by human factors. But recently reported data on fatal accidents involving autonomous driving system (ADS) shows that this important goal has not been achieved. So there is an emerge requirement on more comprehensive and targeted testing especially on safe driving. In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically building critical testing scenarios from real-world accident data. Firstly, we propose a new model called M-CPS (Multi-channel Panoptic Segmentation) to extract the effective information from the accident record (such as images or videos), and separate the independent individuals of different traffic participants for further scene recovery. Compared with the traditional panoramic segmentation models, M-CPS model is able to effectively handle segmentation challenges due to the shooting angle, image quality, pixel overlap and other problems existing in the accident record. Next, the extracted core information is then connected with the virtual testing platform to generate the original scene set. Besides, we also design a mutation testing solution on the basis of the original scene set, thus greatly enriching the scene library for testing. In our experiments, the M-CPS model reaches a result of 66.1% PQ on CityScapes test set, shows that our model has only slight fluctuations on performance compared with the best benchmark model on pure panoptic segmentation task. It also reaches a result of 84.5% IoU for semantic segmentation branch and 40.3% mAP for instance segmentation branch on SHIFT dataset. Then we use UCF-Crime, CADP and US-Accidents datasets to generate the original and mutated scene set. Those generated scene sets are connected to Apollo and Carla simulation platforms to test ADS prototypes. We find three types of scenarios that can lead to accidents of ADS prototypes, which indicates that the existing ADS prototype has defects. Our solution provides a new possible direction for the recovery of key scenarios in ADS testing, and can improve the efficiency in related fields.\n[8] Title: OMG-Seg: Is One Model Good Enough for all Segmentation? **--**Text: In this work, we address various segmentation tasks, each traditionally tackled by distinct or partially unified models. We propose OMG-Seg, One Model that is Good enough to efficiently and effectively handle all the segmentation tasks, including image semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation, as well as their video counterparts, open vocabulary settings, prompt-driven, interactive segmentation like SAM, and video object segmentation. To our knowledge, this is the first model to handle all these tasks in one model and achieve satisfactory performance. We show that OMG-Seg, a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture with task-specific queries and outputs, can support over ten distinct segmentation tasks and yet significantly reduce computational and parameter overhead across various tasks and datasets. We rigorously evaluate the inter-task influences and correlations during co-training. Code and models are available at https://github.com/lxtGH/OMG-Seg.\n[9] Title: Video Panoptic Segmentation **--**Text: Panoptic segmentation has become a new standard of visual recognition task by unifying previous semantic segmentation and instance segmentation tasks in concert. In this paper, we propose and explore a new video extension of this task, called video panoptic segmentation. The task requires generating consistent panoptic segmentation as well as an association of instance ids across video frames. To invigorate research on this new task, we present two types of video panoptic datasets. The first is a re-organization of the synthetic VIPER dataset into the video panoptic format to exploit its large-scale pixel annotations. The second is a temporal extension on the Cityscapes val. set, by providing new video panoptic annotations (Cityscapes-VPS). Moreover, we propose a novel video panoptic segmentation network (VPSNet) which jointly predicts object classes, bounding boxes, masks, instance id tracking, and semantic segmentation in video frames. To provide appropriate metrics for this task, we propose a video panoptic quality (VPQ) metric and evaluate our method and several other baselines. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented two datasets. We achieve state-of-the-art results in image PQ on Cityscapes and also in VPQ on Cityscapes-VPS and VIPER datasets.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nTraditional image segmentation methods have undergone significant evolution over the years, with advancements in various technical aspects contributing to improved performance in tasks such as semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation. \n\nOne key advancement has been the introduction of deep learning-based methods, which have led to substantial improvements in segmentation performance [5].

In contrast, Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation, aiming to generate realistic and complex scene images from user-specified layouts, has risen to prominence. However, existing methods transform layout information into tokens or RGB images for conditional control in the generative process, leading to insufficient spatial and semantic controllability of individual instances. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Spatial-Semantic Map Guided (SSMG) diffusion model that adopts the feature map, derived from the layout, as guidance. Owing to rich spatial and semantic information encapsulated in well-designed feature maps, SSMG achieves superior generation quality with sufficient spatial and semantic controllability compared to previous works. Additionally, we propose the Relation-Sensitive Attention (RSA) and Location-Sensitive Attention (LSA) mechanisms. The former aims to model the relationships among multiple objects within scenes while the latter is designed to heighten the model's sensitivity to the spatial information embedded in the guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SSMG achieves highly promising results, setting a new state-of-the-art across a range of metrics encompassing fidelity, diversity, and controllability.\n[1] Title: DiffuseVAE: Efficient, Controllable and High-Fidelity Generation from Low-Dimensional Latents **--**Text: Diffusion probabilistic models have been shown to generate state-of-the-art results on several competitive image synthesis benchmarks but lack a low-dimensional, interpretable latent space, and are slow at generation. On the other hand, standard Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) typically have access to a low-dimensional latent space but exhibit poor sample quality. We present DiffuseVAE, a novel generative framework that integrates VAE within a diffusion model framework, and leverage this to design novel conditional parameterizations for diffusion models. We show that the resulting model equips diffusion models with a low-dimensional VAE inferred latent code which can be used for downstream tasks like controllable synthesis. The proposed method also improves upon the speed vs quality tradeoff exhibited in standard unconditional DDPM/DDIM models (for instance, FID of 16.47 vs 34.36 using a standard DDIM on the CelebA-HQ-128 benchmark using T=10 reverse process steps) without having explicitly trained for such an objective. Furthermore, the proposed model exhibits synthesis quality comparable to state-of-the-art models on standard image synthesis benchmarks like CIFAR-10 and CelebA-64 while outperforming most existing VAE-based methods. Lastly, we show that the proposed method exhibits inherent generalization to different types of noise in the conditioning signal. For reproducibility, our source code is publicly available at https://github.com/kpandey008/DiffuseVAE.\n[2] Title: Cascaded Diffusion Models for High Fidelity Image Generation **--**Text: We show that cascaded diffusion models are capable of generating high fidelity images on the class-conditional ImageNet generation benchmark, without any assistance from auxiliary image classifiers to boost sample quality. A cascaded diffusion model comprises a pipeline of multiple diffusion models that generate images of increasing resolution, beginning with a standard diffusion model at the lowest resolution, followed by one or more super-resolution diffusion models that successively upsample the image and add higher resolution details. We find that the sample quality of a cascading pipeline relies crucially on conditioning augmentation, our proposed method of data augmentation of the lower resolution conditioning inputs to the super-resolution models. Our experiments show that conditioning augmentation prevents compounding error during sampling in a cascaded model, helping us to train cascading pipelines achieving FID scores of 1.48 at 64x64, 3.52 at 128x128 and 4.88 at 256x256 resolutions, outperforming BigGAN-deep, and classification accuracy scores of 63.02% (top-1) and 84.06% (top-5) at 256x256, outperforming VQ-VAE-2.\n[3] Title: Kaleido Diffusion: Improving Conditional Diffusion Models with Autoregressive Latent Modeling **--**Text: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for generating high-quality images from textual descriptions. Despite their successes, these models often exhibit limited diversity in the sampled images, particularly when sampling with a high classifier-free guidance weight. To address this issue, we present Kaleido, a novel approach that enhances the diversity of samples by incorporating autoregressive latent priors. Kaleido integrates an autoregressive language model that encodes the original caption and generates latent variables, serving as abstract and intermediary representations for guiding and facilitating the image generation process. In this paper, we explore a variety of discrete latent representations, including textual descriptions, detection bounding boxes, object blobs, and visual tokens. These representations diversify and enrich the input conditions to the diffusion models, enabling more diverse outputs. Our experimental results demonstrate that Kaleido effectively broadens the diversity of the generated image samples from a given textual description while maintaining high image quality. Furthermore, we show that Kaleido adheres closely to the guidance provided by the generated latent variables, demonstrating its capability to effectively control and direct the image generation process.\n[4] Title: Diverse Hyperspectral Remote Sensing Image Synthesis With Diffusion Models **--**Text: Hyperspectral image (HSI) synthesis overcomes the limitations of imaging sensors and enables low-cost acquisition of HSIs with high spatial resolution. Using RGB as a conditional input for hyperspectral generation is promising and valuable, as it can leverage abundant existing multispectral/RGB images without the intervention of hyperspectral sensors. However, most existing generation methods follow one-to-one mapping frameworks and ignore generation diversity. In addition, the current evaluation metrics of hyperspectral generation are based on the similarity with the reference image, which cannot reflect the diversity of the generated spectra. In this article, we propose a novel method for diverse hyperspectral remote sensing image generation based on the diffusion model. The diffusion model uses a denoising model to gradually remove noise from the normal distribution and generates the hyperspectral data step-by-step with the conditional RGB image as input. To address the high-dimensional noise prediction problem caused by a large number of bands in the HSI, we introduce a conditional vector quantized generative adversarial network (VQGAN) that maps the high-dimensional hyperspectral data into a low-dimensional latent space and conduct the diffusion process in the latent space. The latent-diffusion process makes the diffusion process faster and more stable. The conditional VQGAN decodes HSIs from the latent code generated by diffusion, with the conditional RGB image as the input, which restricts the diversity to a specific object distribution. We also designed two new metrics to evaluate the generation spectral diversity (SD). Experiments on the IEEE grss_dfc_2018 dataset demonstrate that our method can synthesize highly diverse hyperspectral data. In addition, the rationality of the proposed metrics is also verified.\n[5] Title: Conditioning Diffusion Models via Attributes and Semantic Masks for Face Generation **--**Text: Deep generative models have shown impressive results in generating realistic images of faces. GANs managed to generate high-quality, high-fidelity images when conditioned on semantic masks, but they still lack the ability to diversify their output. Diffusion models partially solve this problem and are able to generate diverse samples given the same condition. In this paper, we propose a multi-conditioning approach for diffusion models via cross-attention exploiting both attributes and semantic masks to generate high-quality and controllable face images. We also studied the impact of applying perceptual-focused loss weighting into the latent space instead of the pixel space. Our method extends the previous approaches by introducing conditioning on more than one set of features, guaranteeing a more fine-grained control over the generated face images. We evaluate our approach on the CelebA-HQ dataset, and we show that it can generate realistic and diverse samples while allowing for fine-grained control over multiple attributes and semantic regions. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to evaluate the impact of different conditioning strategies on the quality and diversity of the generated images.\n[6] Title: CADS: Unleashing the Diversity of Diffusion Models through Condition-Annealed Sampling **--**Text: While conditional diffusion models are known to have good coverage of the data distribution, they still face limitations in output diversity, particularly when sampled with a high classifier-free guidance scale for optimal image quality or when trained on small datasets. We attribute this problem to the role of the conditioning signal in inference and offer an improved sampling strategy for diffusion models that can increase generation diversity, especially at high guidance scales, with minimal loss of sample quality. Our sampling strategy anneals the conditioning signal by adding scheduled, monotonically decreasing Gaussian noise to the conditioning vector during inference to balance diversity and condition alignment. Our Condition-Annealed Diffusion Sampler (CADS) can be used with any pretrained model and sampling algorithm, and we show that it boosts the diversity of diffusion models in various conditional generation tasks. Further, using an existing pretrained diffusion model, CADS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.70 and 2.31 for class-conditional ImageNet generation at 256$\\times$256 and 512$\\times$512 respectively.\n[7] Title: Conditional Distribution Modelling for Few-Shot Image Synthesis with Diffusion Models **--**Text: Few-shot image synthesis entails generating diverse and realistic images of novel categories using only a few example images. While multiple recent efforts in this direction have achieved impressive results, the existing approaches are dependent only upon the few novel samples available at test time in order to generate new images, which restricts the diversity of the generated images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Conditional Distribution Modelling (CDM) -- a framework which effectively utilizes Diffusion models for few-shot image generation. By modelling the distribution of the latent space used to condition a Diffusion process, CDM leverages the learnt statistics of the training data to get a better approximation of the unseen class distribution, thereby removing the bias arising due to limited number of few shot samples. Simultaneously, we devise a novel inversion based optimization strategy that further improves the approximated unseen class distribution, and ensures the fidelity of the generated samples to the unseen class. The experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed CDM for few-shot generation.\n[8] Title: CoDi: Conditional Diffusion Distillation for Higher-Fidelity and Faster Image Generation **--**Text: Large generative diffusion models have revolution-ized text-to-image generation and offer immense po-tential for conditional generation tasks such as im-age enhancement, restoration, editing, and compositing. However, their widespread adoption is hindered by the high computational cost, which limits their real-time application. To address this challenge, we in-troduce a novel method dubbed CoDi, that adapts a pre-trained latent diffusion model to accept additional image conditioning inputs while significantly reducing the sampling steps required to achieve high-quality results. Our method can leverage architectures such as ControlNet to incorporate conditioning inputs with-out compromising the model's prior knowledge gained during large scale pre-training. Additionally, a con-ditional consistency loss enforces consistent predictions across diffusion steps, effectively compelling the model to generate high-quality images with conditions in a few steps. Our conditional-task learning and distil-lation approach outperforms previous distillation meth-ods, achieving a new state-of-the-art in producing high-quality images with very few steps (e.g., 1\u20134) across multiple tasks, including super-resolution, text-guided image editing, and depth-to-image generation.\n[9] Title: UNIMO-G: Unified Image Generation through Multimodal Conditional Diffusion **--**Text: Existing text-to-image diffusion models primarily generate images from text prompts. However, the inherent conciseness of textual descriptions poses challenges in faithfully synthesizing images with intricate details, such as specific entities or scenes. This paper presents UNIMO-G, a simple multimodal conditional diffusion framework that operates on multimodal prompts with interleaved textual and visual inputs, which demonstrates a unified ability for both text-driven and subject-driven image generation. UNIMO-G comprises two core components: a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for encoding multimodal prompts, and a conditional denoising diffusion network for generating images based on the encoded multimodal input. We leverage a two-stage training strategy to effectively train the framework: firstly pre-training on large-scale text-image pairs to develop conditional image generation capabilities, and then instruction tuning with multimodal prompts to achieve unified image generation proficiency. A well-designed data processing pipeline involving language grounding and image segmentation is employed to construct multi-modal prompts. UNIMO-G excels in both text-to-image generation and zero-shot subject-driven synthesis, and is notably effective in generating high-fidelity images from complex multimodal prompts involving multiple image entities.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nConditional image generation techniques, including those based on diffusion models, have made significant progress in generating high-quality images from various inputs, such as text descriptions, semantic masks, and attributes [0][3][5]. However, these models still face several challenges and limitations, particularly when it comes to achieving high fidelity and diversity in generated images [3][6][7].\n\nOne of the primary challenges is the limited ability to control the generation process, leading to a lack of diversity in the output images [3]. This is particularly evident when sampling with a high classifier-free guidance weight, resulting in limited diversity in the generated images [3]. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various techniques, such as incorporating autoregressive latent priors [3], using multiple conditioning signals [5], and annealing the conditioning signal [6].\n\nAnother challenge is the need for high-quality conditioning inputs, which can be difficult to obtain, especially in cases where the input data is limited or noisy [4][5]. For instance, in the case of hyperspectral image synthesis, the conditioning input is typically an RGB image, which may not fully capture the nuances of the hyperspectral data [4]. To address this, researchers have proposed using conditional vector quantized generative adversarial networks (VQGANs) to map high-dimensional hyperspectral data to a low-dimensional latent space [4].\n\nAdditionally, conditional image generation techniques can be computationally expensive, particularly when using large diffusion models [8]. To address this, researchers have proposed methods that adapt pre-trained latent diffusion models to accept additional image conditioning inputs while reducing the sampling steps required to achieve high-quality results [8].\n\nFurthermore, conditional image generation techniques can struggle to generalize to new, unseen classes or categories, particularly when trained on limited data [7]. To address this, researchers have proposed techniques such as conditional distribution modelling, which leverages the learnt statistics of the training data to approximate the unseen class distribution [7].\n\nIn summary, the primary challenges and limitations of conditional image generation techniques include limited control over the generation process, the need for high-quality conditioning inputs, computational expense, and difficulty in generalizing to new classes or categories. Addressing these challenges requires the development of new techniques and methods that can improve the fidelity, diversity, and generalization of generated images.\n\n**********\n\n## Question 3\n\nIn the context of object completion, how have previous methods addressed the issue of generating realistic and comprehensive object shapes, and what are the common strategies used to handle occlusions and partial visibility?\n\n### Passage\n\n[0] Title: P2C: Self-Supervised Point Cloud Completion from Single Partial Clouds **--**Text: Point cloud completion aims to recover the complete shape based on a partial observation. Existing methods require either complete point clouds or multiple partial observations of the same object for learning. In contrast to previous approaches, we present Partial2Complete (P2C), the first self-supervised framework that completes point cloud objects using training samples consisting of only a single incomplete point cloud per object. Specifically, our framework groups incomplete point clouds into local patches as input and predicts masked patches by learning prior information from different partial objects. We also propose Region-Aware Chamfer Distance to regularize shape mismatch without limiting completion capability, and devise the Normal Consistency Constraint to incorporate a local planarity assumption, encouraging the recovered shape surface to be continuous and complete. In this way, P2C no longer needs multiple observations or complete point clouds as ground truth. Instead, structural cues are learned from a category-specific dataset to complete partial point clouds of objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both synthetic ShapeNet data and real-world ScanNet data, showing that P2C produces comparable results to methods trained with complete shapes, and outperforms methods learned with multiple partial observations. Code is available at https://github.com/CuiRuikai/Partial2Complete.\n[1] Title: Object Completion using k\u2010Sparse Optimization **--**Text: We present a new method for the completion of partial globally\u2010symmetric 3D objects, based on the detection of partial and approximate symmetries in the incomplete input dataset. In our approach, symmetry detection is formulated as a constrained sparsity maximization problem, which is solved efficiently using a robust RANSAC\u2010based optimizer. The detected partial symmetries are then reused iteratively, in order to complete the missing parts of the object. A global error relaxation method minimizes the accumulated alignment errors and a non\u2010rigid registration approach applies local deformations in order to properly handle approximate symmetry. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not rely on the computation of features, it uniformly handles translational, rotational and reflectional symmetries and can provide plausible object completion results, even on challenging cases, where more than half of the target object is missing. We demonstrate our algorithm in the completion of 3D scans with varying levels of partiality and we show the applicability of our approach in the repair and completion of heavily eroded or incomplete cultural heritage objects.\n[2] Title: AnchorFormer: Point Cloud Completion from Discriminative Nodes **--**Text: Point cloud completion aims to recover the completed 3D shape of an object from its partial observation. A common strategy is to encode the observed points to a global feature vector and then predict the complete points through a generative process on this vector. Nevertheless, the results may suffer from the high-quality shape generation problem due to the fact that a global feature vector cannot sufficiently characterize diverse patterns in one object. In this paper, we present a new shape completion architecture, namely AnchorFormer, that innovatively leverages pattern-aware discriminative nodes, i.e., anchors, to dynamically capture regional information of objects. Technically, AnchorFormer models the regional discrimination by learning a set of anchors based on the point features of the input partial observation. Such anchors are scattered to both observed and unobserved locations through estimating particular offsets, and form sparse points together with the down-sampled points of the input observation. To reconstruct the finegrained object patterns, AnchorFormer further employs a modulation scheme to morph a canonical 2D grid at individual locations of the sparse points into a detailed 3D structure. Extensive experiments on the PCN, ShapeNet-55/34 and KITTI datasets quantitatively and qualitatively demonstrate the efficacy of AnchorFormer over the state-of-the-art point cloud completion approaches. Source code is available at https://github.com/chenzhik/AnchorFormer.\n[3] Title: Amodal Ground Truth and Completion in the Wild **--**Text: This paper studies amodal image segmentation: predicting entire object segmentation masks including both visible and invisible (occluded) parts. In previous work, the amodal segmentation ground truth on real images is usually pre-dicted by manual annotaton and thus is subjective. In contrast, we use 3D data to establish an automatic pipeline to determine authentic ground truth amodal masks for partially occluded objects in real images. This pipeline is used to construct an amodal completion evaluation benchmark, MP3D-Amodal, consisting of a variety of object categories and la-bels. To better handle the amodal completion task in the wild, we explore two architecture variants: a two-stage model that first infers the occluder, followed by amodal mask completion; and a one-stage model that exploits the representation power of Stable Diffusion for amodal segmentation across many categories. Without bells and whistles, our method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance on Amodal segmentation datasets that cover a large variety of objects, in-cluding COCOA and our new MP3D-Amodal dataset. The dataset, model, and code are available at https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/amodal/\n[4] Title: SeedFormer: Patch Seeds based Point Cloud Completion with Upsample Transformer **--**Text: Point cloud completion has become increasingly popular among generation tasks of 3D point clouds, as it is a challenging yet indispensable problem to recover the complete shape of a 3D object from its partial observation. In this paper, we propose a novel SeedFormer to improve the ability of detail preservation and recovery in point cloud completion. Unlike previous methods based on a global feature vector, we introduce a new shape representation, namely Patch Seeds, which not only captures general structures from partial inputs but also preserves regional information of local patterns. Then, by integrating seed features into the generation process, we can recover faithful details for complete point clouds in a coarse-to-fine manner. Moreover, we devise an Upsample Transformer by extending the transformer structure into basic operations of point generators, which effectively incorporates spatial and semantic relationships between neighboring points. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art completion networks on several benchmark datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/hrzhou2/seedformer.\n[5] Title: ShapeFormer: Transformer-based Shape Completion via Sparse Representation **--**Text: We present ShapeFormer, a transformer-based network that produces a distribution of object completions, conditioned on incomplete, and possibly noisy, point clouds. The resultant distribution can then be sampled to generate likely completions, each exhibiting plausible shape details while being faithful to the input. To facilitate the use of transformers for 3D, we introduce a compact 3D representation, vector quantized deep implicit function (VQDIF), that utilizes spatial sparsity to represent a close approximation of a 3D shape by a short sequence of discrete variables. Experiments demonstrate that ShapeFormer outperforms prior art for shape completion from ambiguous partial inputs in terms of both completion quality and diversity. We also show that our approach effectively handles a variety of shape types, incomplete patterns, and real-world scans.\n[6] Title: Amodal Completion via Progressive Mixed Context Diffusion **--**Text: Our brain can effortlessly recognize objects even when partially hidden from view. Seeing the visible of the hidden is called amodal completion; however, this task remains a challenge for generative AI despite rapid progress. We propose to sidestep many of the difficulties of existing approaches, which typically involve a two-step process of predicting amodal masks and then generating pixels. Our method involves thinking outside the box, literally! We go outside the object bounding box to use its context to guide a pretrained diffusion inpainting model, and then progressively grow the occluded object and trim the extra background. We overcome two technical challenges: 1) how to be free of unwanted co-occurrence bias, which tends to regenerate similar occluders, and 2) how to judge if an amodal completion has succeeded. Our amodal completion method exhibits improved photorealistic completion results compared to existing approaches in numerous successful completion cases. And the best part? It doesn't require any special training or fine-tuning of models.\n[7] Title: Active Visuo-Haptic Object Shape Completion **--**Text: Recent advancements in object shape completion have enabled impressive object reconstructions using only visual input. However, due to self-occlusion, the reconstructions have high uncertainty in the occluded object parts, which negatively impacts the performance of downstream robotic tasks such as grasping. In this work, we propose an active visuo-haptic shape completion method called Act-VH that actively computes where to touch the objects based on the reconstruction uncertainty. Act-VH reconstructs objects from point clouds and calculates the reconstruction uncertainty using IGR, a recent state-of-the-art implicit surface deep neural network. We experimentally evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of Act-VH against five baselines in simulation, for which we propose a new simulation environment, and in the real world. The results show that Act-VH outperforms all baselines and that an uncertainty-driven haptic exploration policy leads to higher reconstruction accuracy than a random policy and a policy driven by Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces. As a final experiment, we evaluate Act-VH and the best reconstruction baseline on grasping 10 novel objects. The results show that Act-VH reaches a significantly higher grasp success rate than the baseline on all objects. Together, this work opens up the door for using active visuo-haptic shape completion in more complex cluttered scenes.\n[8] Title: From Reassembly to Object Completion: A Complete Systems Pipeline **--**Text: The problem of the restoration of broken artifacts, where large parts could be missing, is of high importance in archaeology. The typical manual restoration can become a tedious and error-prone process, which also does not scale well. In recent years, many methods have been proposed for assisting the process, most of which target specialized object types or operate under very strict constraints. We propose a digital shape restoration pipeline consisting of proven, robust methods for automatic fragment reassembly and shape completion of generic three-dimensional objects of arbitrary type. In this pipeline, first we introduce a novel unified approach for handling the reassembly of objects from heavily damaged fragments by exploiting both fracture surfaces and salient features on the intact sides of fragments, when available. Second, we propose an object completion procedure based on generalized symmetries and a complementary part extraction process that is suitable for driving the fabrication of missing geometry. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using real-world fractured objects and software implemented as part of the European Union--funded PRESIOUS project, which is also available for download from the project site.\n[9] Title: 3DSGrasp: 3D Shape-Completion for Robotic Grasp **--**Text: Real-world robotic grasping can be done robustly if a complete 3D Point Cloud Data (PCD) of an object is available. However, in practice, PCDs are often incomplete when objects are viewed from few and sparse viewpoints before the grasping action, leading to the generation of wrong or inaccurate grasp poses. We propose a novel grasping strategy, named 3DSGrasp, that predicts the missing geometry from the partial PCD to produce reliable grasp poses. Our proposed PCD completion network is a Transformer-based encoder-decoder network with an Offset-Attention layer. Our network is inherently invariant to the object pose and point's permutation, which generates PCDs that are geometrically consistent and completed properly. Experiments on a wide range of partial PCD show that 3DSGrasp outperforms the best state-of-the-art method on PCD completion tasks and largely improves the grasping success rate in real-world scenarios. The code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/NunoDuarte/3DSGrasp.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nIn the context of object completion, previous methods have addressed the issue of generating realistic and comprehensive object shapes by employing various strategies to handle occlusions and partial visibility. One common approach is to use symmetry detection and symmetry-based completion [1]. For instance, [1] presents a method that detects partial and approximate symmetries in the incomplete input dataset and uses them to complete the missing parts of the object.\n\nAnother strategy is to use global feature vectors to encode the observed points and then predict the complete points through a generative process [2]. However, this approach may suffer from the high-quality shape generation problem due to the fact that a global feature vector cannot sufficiently characterize diverse patterns in one object. To address this issue, methods like AnchorFormer [2] and SeedFormer [4] have been proposed, which leverage pattern-aware discriminative nodes and patch seeds to capture regional information of objects and preserve local patterns.\n\nTo handle occlusions, some methods use amodal completion, which involves predicting entire object segmentation masks including both visible and invisible (occluded) parts [3][6]. Amodal completion can be achieved through various approaches, such as using a two-stage model that first infers the occluder, followed by amodal mask completion [3], or using a one-stage model that exploits the representation power of Stable Diffusion for amodal segmentation across many categories [3].\n\nTo handle partial visibility, methods like P2C [0] and ShapeFormer [5] use a self-supervised framework that completes point cloud objects using training samples consisting of only a single incomplete point cloud per object. P2C groups incomplete point clouds into local patches as input and predicts masked patches by learning prior information from different partial objects. ShapeFormer, on the other hand, produces a distribution of object completions, conditioned on incomplete, and possibly noisy, point clouds.\n\nIn addition, some methods use active visuo-haptic shape completion to actively compute where to touch the objects based on the reconstruction uncertainty [7]. This approach can improve the performance of downstream robotic tasks such as grasping.\n\nOverall, previous methods have employed various strategies to handle occlusions and partial visibility, including symmetry detection, global feature vectors, pattern-aware discriminative nodes, patch seeds, amodal completion, and active visuo-haptic shape completion. These approaches have shown promising results in generating realistic and comprehensive object shapes.\n\n**********\n\n"}], "output": "Thank you for your help!

The proposed method follows an iterative mask denoising (IMD) pipeline, which integrates the image generation and object segmentation tasks. Specifically, in each iteration, MaskComp first generates complete objects given the partially visible object and its corresponding mask. Then, MaskComp leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to obtain the mask of the whole object from the generated image. After that, by comparing the masks of the (partial) visible object from the original image and the generated image, MaskComp obtains a more complete object mask, which can be used in the next iteration. In the experiments, the authors show that MaskComp outperforms other methods, e.g., ControlNet, in object completion.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3 good\n\n### Presentation\n\n3 good\n\n### Contribution\n\n2 fair\n\n### Strengths\n\n**Originality**: The proposed MaskComp is a simple yet effective method for object completion. The idea of iteratively obtaining a more complete object mask is interesting.\n\n**Quality**: The experiments show that MaskComp can obtain better quantitative and qualitative results than ControlNet, Kandinsky 2.1, and Stable Diffusion.\n\n**Clarity**: The motivation and the proposed method are clearly explained.\n\n**Significance**: The proposed method could help advance the field of object completion, which is an important task in computer vision.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The proposed method needs a pre-trained object completion method, e.g., ControlNet. Thus, the comparison between MaskComp and other methods that are not based on ControlNet may not be fair. In particular, the performance of MaskComp relies on the quality of the base model, e.g., Stable Diffusion.\n\n2. The proposed method needs the ground-truth text prompt of the input image, which is not easy to obtain in real-world applications.\n\n3. In the experiments, the authors only compare MaskComp with ControlNet, Kandinsky 2.1, and Stable Diffusion, which are not specifically designed for object completion. More comparisons with recent object completion methods should be included.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper's reliance on a pre-trained object completion model like ControlNet raises concerns about the fairness of comparisons with methods that do not use such priors. While the authors use ControlNet as a base, it is not clear if the performance gains are solely due to the proposed iterative mask denoising (IMD) pipeline or if they are significantly influenced by the capabilities of ControlNet. A more rigorous evaluation would involve comparing MaskComp against methods that start from a similar baseline, or alternatively, providing a detailed ablation study that isolates the contribution of the IMD pipeline from the base model. Furthermore, the paper should explore the sensitivity of MaskComp to the choice of the base model. For example, how would MaskComp perform with different base models, and what are the trade-offs in terms of computational cost and performance? This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's robustness and generalizability.\n\nThe requirement for ground-truth text prompts is a significant limitation for real-world applications. The authors should acknowledge that obtaining such prompts is not always feasible and explore alternative approaches to address this issue. For instance, the authors could investigate the use of automatically generated text prompts or explore methods that do not rely on text prompts at all. The paper should also discuss the impact of inaccurate or misleading text prompts on the performance of MaskComp. How does the method behave when the provided text prompt does not accurately describe the object in the image? This analysis would provide a more realistic assessment of the method's applicability in practical scenarios. Additionally, the authors could consider incorporating techniques for prompt refinement or correction to mitigate the impact of noisy prompts.\n\nFinally, the experimental evaluation should be expanded to include comparisons with more recent and specialized object completion methods. While the comparison with ControlNet, Kandinsky 2.1, and Stable Diffusion is useful, these methods are not specifically designed for object completion. The authors should include comparisons with methods that explicitly address the object completion task, such as those based on amodal perception or iterative refinement. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of MaskComp's performance and demonstrate its advantages over state-of-the-art object completion techniques. The authors should also consider using a wider range of evaluation metrics that are specifically designed for object completion, such as metrics that measure the accuracy of the completed object's shape and appearance. This would provide a more detailed and nuanced assessment of the method's performance.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. In the experiments, the authors only show the results of completing the occluded objects in natural images. I wonder if MaskComp could also handle the simple 3D rotations.\n\n2. In the experiments, the authors only show the results of completing a single object in an image. I wonder how MaskComp would handle the objects in complex scenes with multiple objects.\n\n### Rating\n\n5: marginally below the acceptance threshold\n\n### Confidence\n\n4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper introduces a new approach to object completion, which aims to reconstruct a complete object from its partially visible components. The proposed method, named MaskComp, iteratively refines the object mask through alternating stages of generation and segmentation. The generation stage conditions on the current mask to produce a complete object image, while the segmentation stage refines the mask based on the generated image. This iterative process effectively denoises the object mask, leading to progressively better object completion results. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of MaskComp on two datasets, AHP and DYCE, showing superior performance compared to existing methods like ControlNet and Stable Diffusion.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3 good\n\n### Presentation\n\n3 good\n\n### Contribution\n\n2 fair\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The proposed MaskComp is a novel approach to object completion that combines image generation and segmentation in an iterative manner. The idea of using the generated image to refine the object mask is innovative and effective.\n\n2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors provide a clear explanation of the proposed method and its underlying principles.\n\n3. The authors conduct extensive experiments on two datasets, AHP and DYCE, and demonstrate the superiority of MaskComp over existing methods. The results are convincing and support the claims made in the paper.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The proposed method requires paired data for training, which may limit its applicability in real-world scenarios where paired data is not readily available. The reliance on paired partial and complete object images, along with their corresponding masks, poses a significant challenge for datasets lacking such explicit annotations. This requirement could hinder the method's generalization to more diverse and uncurated datasets.\n\n2. The proposed method is rather incremental, and the technical contribution is kind of limited. The core idea of iterative refinement through generation and segmentation, while effective, builds upon existing techniques. The novelty lies primarily in the specific combination and application of these techniques rather than a fundamental breakthrough in either generation or segmentation.\n\n3. The proposed method seems to be only evaluated on human and simple objects. It would be better to evaluate on more complex objects and scenes. The current evaluation, focused on human-related datasets and relatively simple objects, does not fully demonstrate the method's robustness and scalability. Testing on more intricate objects with varying shapes, textures, and occlusion patterns is necessary to validate its broader applicability.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe authors should explore methods to reduce the reliance on paired training data. Techniques such as unsupervised or self-supervised learning could be investigated to pre-train the model, potentially using large-scale unlabeled image datasets. This would allow the model to learn general object representations and reduce the need for explicit paired examples. Furthermore, exploring data augmentation strategies that simulate partial object views could also help in improving the model's generalization capabilities with limited paired data. The use of synthetic data generation could also be considered to create a larger training set with paired data, which could then be used to fine-tune the model for real-world scenarios.\n\nTo address the limited technical contribution, the authors should focus on highlighting the specific aspects of their method that are novel and demonstrate their impact. For example, a detailed analysis of the iterative refinement process, showing how the mask quality improves with each iteration and how this improvement translates to better object completion, would be beneficial. A comparison with alternative iterative refinement strategies, or an ablation study that isolates the contribution of each component (generation and segmentation), would further strengthen the technical contribution. Furthermore, exploring the theoretical underpinnings of the proposed method, such as convergence properties or the conditions under which it performs optimally, could also enhance the technical depth of the paper.\n\nFinally, the evaluation should be expanded to include more complex objects and scenes. This could involve using datasets with a wider variety of object categories, including those with intricate shapes, textures, and occlusion patterns. The authors should also consider evaluating the method's performance on scenes with multiple objects and varying levels of occlusion. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's robustness and scalability. Additionally, the authors should analyze the failure cases of the method and discuss the limitations of the current approach. This would help in identifying areas for future improvement and provide a more balanced view of the method's capabilities.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. How does the proposed method handle cases where the partial object is heavily occluded or has significant variations in appearance compared to the complete object? Are there any limitations in terms of the types of objects or scenes that the method can handle effectively?\n\n2. The proposed method seems to be computationally expensive due to the iterative nature of the process. How does the computational cost of the proposed method compare to existing methods? Are there any potential optimizations that could be made to improve its efficiency?\n\n3. The paper mentions that the proposed method can be used for other editing tasks such as object layer switching. Can the authors provide more details on how this can be achieved and show some examples of such applications?\n\n### Rating\n\n5: marginally below the acceptance threshold\n\n### Confidence\n\n4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain. It is unlikely, but not impossible, that you did not understand some parts of the submission or that you are unfamiliar with some pieces of related work.\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 3\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper proposes a new approach to object completion, which aims to reconstruct a complete object from its partially visible components. The proposed method, named MaskComp, delineates the completion process through iterative stages of generation and segmentation. In each iteration, the object mask is provided as an additional condition to boost image generation, and, in return, the generated images can lead to a more accurate mask by fusing the segmentation of images. The combination of one generation and one segmentation stage effectively functions as a mask denoiser. Through alternation between the generation and segmentation stages, the partial object mask is progressively refined, providing precise shape guidance and yielding superior object completion results. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of MaskComp over existing approaches, e.g., ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, establishing it as an effective solution for object completion.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3 good\n\n### Presentation\n\n3 good\n\n### Contribution\n\n3 good\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The proposed method is novel and effective. It bridges the generation and segmentation, and achieves better performance than the previous methods.\n2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.\n3. The experiments are sufficient to support the claims in the paper.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The proposed method is not very efficient. It requires multiple steps of generation and segmentation to obtain the final result. \n2. The proposed method requires the paired data of partial objects and complete objects for training, which may limit its applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper introduces an iterative approach to object completion, which alternates between generation and segmentation. While this iterative refinement is effective, the computational cost is a significant concern. The method requires multiple passes of both a generative model and a segmentation model, which can be time-consuming, especially for high-resolution images or complex scenes. Future work could explore techniques to reduce the number of iterations needed, such as more efficient mask refinement strategies or adaptive stopping criteria. For example, instead of a fixed number of iterations, the process could terminate when the change in mask quality between iterations falls below a certain threshold. Additionally, exploring parallelization of the generation and segmentation steps could also improve efficiency. The current approach processes each stage sequentially, which may not be optimal. Investigating methods to perform these steps concurrently or with minimal dependencies could lead to significant speedups.\n\nAnother area for improvement is the reliance on paired data for training. While the authors argue that paired data is necessary for their approach, this requirement limits the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios where such data is often unavailable. The method's dependence on paired partial and complete object images makes it difficult to generalize to unseen object categories or datasets without extensive paired data collection. Future work should explore methods to reduce this dependency, such as using unpaired or weakly paired data. Techniques like cycle-consistency or adversarial training could be explored to learn the mapping between partial and complete objects without requiring explicit paired examples. Furthermore, investigating the use of synthetic data or data augmentation techniques could also help to mitigate the need for large amounts of real-world paired data. The authors should also consider exploring the use of pre-trained models or transfer learning to reduce the need for large datasets.\n\nFinally, the paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of the failure cases of the proposed method. While the experiments demonstrate the superiority of MaskComp over existing approaches, it is important to understand the limitations of the method. For example, under what conditions does the iterative refinement process fail to converge to a good solution? Are there specific types of objects or occlusions that are particularly challenging for the method? A more thorough analysis of these failure cases would provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach and guide future research directions. The authors should also consider including a qualitative analysis of the generated masks and completed objects to better understand the visual quality of the results.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

The process of alternating between generation and segmentation steps, even with a small number of iterations, can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with high-resolution images or complex scenes. This inefficiency could limit the practical application of the method in real-time scenarios or when processing large datasets. Future work should explore methods to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence, perhaps by incorporating more sophisticated mask refinement techniques or by using more efficient generative and segmentation models.

The method's performance on unpaired or weakly paired data is not explored, which raises concerns about its generalizability. Future research should focus on developing techniques that can reduce or eliminate the need for paired data.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces MaskComp, a novel approach to object completion that iteratively refines object masks through alternating stages of image generation and segmentation. The core idea is to leverage the synergy between these two processes, where the generation stage, conditioned on a partial object and its mask, produces a completed object, and the segmentation stage, applied to the generated image, provides a more accurate mask. This iterative process, termed Iterative Mask Denoising (IMD), progressively improves the mask quality, leading to more precise object completion. The method builds upon ControlNet, a conditional image generation model, and utilizes a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model for the generative component. For the segmentation stage, MaskComp employs the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of MaskComp on two datasets, AHP and DYCE, showing superior performance compared to existing methods like ControlNet and Stable Diffusion. The method's key contribution lies in its iterative refinement strategy, which effectively combines generation and segmentation to achieve high-quality object completion. The paper presents a clear methodology, supported by experimental results, and highlights the potential of iterative approaches for addressing complex image editing tasks. However, the paper also acknowledges certain limitations, such as the computational cost of the iterative process and the reliance on paired data for training. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the field of object completion, offering a novel and effective approach that combines generation and segmentation in a synergistic manner. The results are compelling, but the paper also identifies areas for future research, such as improving the efficiency of the method and reducing its dependence on paired training data. The authors also suggest that the method could be used for other editing tasks such as object layer switching, which could be a promising direction for future work.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nI find the core strength of this paper to be the innovative approach of combining image generation and segmentation in an iterative manner for object completion. The proposed Iterative Mask Denoising (IMD) process is a novel and effective way to progressively refine object masks, leading to superior completion results. The idea of using the generated image to improve the mask, and then using the improved mask to generate a better image, is a clever way to leverage the strengths of both generative and segmentation models. The paper clearly articulates this methodology, making it easy to understand the core contribution. The experimental results, which demonstrate the superiority of MaskComp over existing methods like ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, provide strong empirical support for the proposed approach. The authors have conducted sufficient experiments on two datasets, AHP and DYCE, to validate their claims. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow, which enhances its accessibility and impact. The authors have clearly explained the motivation behind their work, the details of their method, and the results of their experiments. The use of ControlNet as a base model, while also a weakness, is also a strength in that it provides a strong foundation for the proposed method. The authors have made fundamental modifications to ControlNet to enable object completion, which demonstrates their understanding of the underlying techniques. The use of Stable Diffusion as the generative model also contributes to the strength of the method, as it is a powerful and widely used model. The authors have also clearly stated the limitations of their method, which is a sign of good scientific practice. Overall, I believe the paper presents a significant contribution to the field of object completion, offering a novel and effective approach that combines generation and segmentation in a synergistic manner. The results are compelling, and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The authors have clearly articulated their contribution and have provided strong empirical support for their claims.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nAfter a thorough examination of the paper, I have identified several key weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the proposed method's efficiency is a significant concern. The iterative nature of the IMD process, which involves alternating between generation and segmentation stages, introduces a substantial computational overhead. As the paper states, \"The IMD process is repeated for a fixed number of steps (T), with each step involving the generation and segmentation stages.\" (Method -> Iterative Mask Denoising (IMD) Process). The experimental section further reveals that, during inference, the IMD process is conducted for 5 steps, with 5 images generated for each step. The inference time for each component per IMD step is 14.3 seconds for generation and 1.2 seconds for segmentation, resulting in a total of 15.5 seconds per step. This means that the total inference time for the entire process is 77.5 seconds per image. This computational cost is substantial and could limit the practical application of the method in real-time scenarios or when processing large datasets. This is a valid concern, and I have high confidence in this assessment, based on the explicit description of the iterative process and the provided inference times. Second, the method's reliance on paired data for training is a significant limitation. While the paper does not explicitly state that paired data is required, the problem formulation and the training process strongly suggest that paired or near-paired data is used. The paper states, \"We address the object completion task, wherein the objective is to predict the image of a complete object $I_c$ based on its visible (non-occluded) part $I_p$.\" (Method -> Problem Definition and Key Insight). This implies a mapping from partial to complete objects, which typically requires paired data. Furthermore, the training is conducted on the AHP dataset and a filtered subset of OpenImage, both of which likely contain paired or near-paired information. This reliance on paired data restricts the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios where such data is often unavailable. This is a partially valid concern, and I have medium confidence in this assessment, based on the problem formulation and the training datasets used. Third, the method's dependence on a pre-trained object completion method, specifically ControlNet, raises concerns about the fairness of comparisons with methods that do not use such priors. The paper states, \"We introduce \\textbf{\\textsl{CompNet}} as the generative model $\\mathcal{G}$ which aims to recover complete objects based on partial conditions. We build CompNet based on popular ControlNet \\cite{zhang2023adding} while making fundamental modifications to enable object completion.\" (Method -> Generation Stage). The performance of MaskComp is therefore influenced by the quality of the base model, Stable Diffusion, which is used in a frozen state. The comparison with methods that are not based on ControlNet, such as Kandinsky 2.1 and Stable Diffusion, may not be entirely fair, as MaskComp benefits from the pre-training of ControlNet. This is a valid concern, and I have high confidence in this assessment, based on the explicit statement about building CompNet on ControlNet. Fourth, the method's requirement for ground-truth text prompts is a significant limitation for real-world applications. The paper mentions using BLIP to generate text prompts for training ControlNet, stating, \"For a more generalized setting, we train the CompNet on a subset of the OpenImage \\citep{kuznetsova2020open} dataset for 36 epochs. We generate text prompts using BLIP \\citep{li2022blip} for all experiments (prompts are necessary to train ControlNet).\" (Experiments -> Implementation details). The fact that all baseline methods are given the same text prompts during experiments further supports the claim that the method relies on these prompts. While the method description itself doesn't explicitly mention text prompts as input to the generation stage, the reliance on ControlNet and Stable Diffusion, which are text-conditional, makes this a valid concern. Obtaining such prompts is not always feasible in real-world scenarios, limiting the method's applicability. This is a valid concern, and I have high confidence in this assessment, based on the mention of using BLIP for prompt generation and the statement about prompts being necessary for training ControlNet. Finally, the experimental evaluation is limited by the choice of baselines. The paper compares MaskComp with ControlNet, Kandinsky 2.1, and Stable Diffusion, which are not specifically designed for object completion. The lack of comparisons with recent object completion methods is a significant weakness, as it does not fully demonstrate the method's superiority over state-of-the-art techniques in this specific domain. This is a valid concern, and I have high confidence in this assessment, based on the list of baselines in the experimental section and the absence of comparisons with dedicated object completion methods. Additionally, the evaluation is primarily focused on human-related datasets and relatively simple objects, which does not fully demonstrate the method's robustness and scalability. Testing on more intricate objects with varying shapes, textures, and occlusion patterns is necessary to validate its broader applicability. This is a partially valid concern, and I have medium confidence in this assessment, based on the description of the datasets used and the visual examples provided in the paper.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nBased on the identified weaknesses, I propose several concrete and actionable improvements. First, to address the efficiency issue, future work should explore techniques to reduce the number of iterations required for convergence. This could involve incorporating more sophisticated mask refinement strategies or using more efficient generative and segmentation models. For example, instead of a fixed number of iterations, the process could terminate when the change in mask quality between iterations falls below a certain threshold. Additionally, investigating the possibility of parallelizing the generation and segmentation steps could also lead to significant speedups. The current approach processes each stage sequentially, which may not be optimal. Exploring methods to perform these steps concurrently or with minimal dependencies could lead to significant speedups. Second, to mitigate the reliance on paired data, future research should explore methods to reduce or eliminate this requirement. This could involve exploring self-supervised learning methods or leveraging existing large-scale datasets with unpaired data. Techniques like cycle-consistency or adversarial training could be explored to learn the mapping between partial and complete objects without requiring explicit paired examples. Furthermore, investigating the use of synthetic data or data augmentation techniques could also help to mitigate the need for large amounts of real-world paired data. The authors should also consider exploring the use of pre-trained models or transfer learning to reduce the need for large datasets. Third, to address the dependence on ControlNet, future work should explore methods to reduce the reliance on this specific pre-trained model. This could involve exploring alternative base models or developing a method that is less dependent on a specific pre-trained architecture. A more rigorous evaluation would involve comparing MaskComp against methods that start from a similar baseline, or alternatively, providing a detailed ablation study that isolates the contribution of the IMD pipeline from the base model. Furthermore, the paper should explore the sensitivity of MaskComp to the choice of the base model. For example, how would MaskComp perform with different base models, and what are the trade-offs in terms of computational cost and performance? This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method's robustness and generalizability. Fourth, to address the requirement for ground-truth text prompts, the authors should acknowledge that obtaining such prompts is not always feasible and explore alternative approaches to address this issue. For instance, the authors could investigate the use of automatically generated text prompts or explore methods that do not rely on text prompts at all. The paper should also discuss the impact of inaccurate or misleading text prompts on the performance of MaskComp. How does the method behave when the provided text prompt does not accurately describe the object in the image? This analysis would provide a more realistic assessment of the method's applicability in practical scenarios. Additionally, the authors could consider incorporating techniques for prompt refinement or correction to mitigate the impact of noisy prompts. Finally, to improve the evaluation, the authors should include comparisons with more recent and specialized object completion methods. This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of MaskComp's performance and demonstrate its advantages over state-of-the-art object completion techniques. The authors should also consider using a wider range of evaluation metrics that are specifically designed for object completion, such as metrics that measure the accuracy of the completed object's shape and appearance. This would provide a more detailed and nuanced assessment of the method's performance. The evaluation should also be expanded to include more complex objects and scenes. This could involve using datasets with a wider variety of object categories, including those with intricate shapes, textures, and occlusion patterns. The authors should also consider evaluating the method's performance on scenes with multiple objects and varying levels of occlusion. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the method's robustness and scalability. Additionally, the authors should analyze the failure cases of the method and discuss the limitations of the current approach. This would help in identifying areas for future improvement and provide a more balanced view of the method's capabilities.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the method. First, what is the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of processing time per image, and how does this compare to existing methods? While the paper provides the inference time per IMD step, a more direct comparison with other methods would be beneficial. Second, how does the proposed method perform on other datasets, such as the dataset used in ControlNet, or other datasets specifically designed for object completion? This would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's generalizability. Third, how does the proposed method handle cases where the partial object is heavily occluded or has significant variations in appearance compared to the complete object? Are there any limitations in terms of the types of objects or scenes that the method can handle effectively? Fourth, what are the specific conditions under which the iterative refinement process fails to converge to a good solution? Are there specific types of objects or occlusions that are particularly challenging for the method? A more thorough analysis of these failure cases would provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach. Fifth, the paper mentions that the proposed method can be used for other editing tasks such as object layer switching. Can the authors provide more details on how this can be achieved and show some examples of such applications? This would demonstrate the versatility of the method and its potential for broader impact. Finally, how does the computational cost of the proposed method compare to existing methods? Are there any potential optimizations that could be made to improve its efficiency? This is a critical question, given the iterative nature of the method. These questions target key uncertainties and methodological choices, seeking clarification of critical assumptions and limitations.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n5.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}"}}, {"id": "syoLhUJmth", "title": "From CLIP to DINO: Visual Encoders Shout in Multi-modal Large Language Models", "paper_context": "\\title{From CLIP to DINO: Visual Encoders Shout in Multi-modal Large Language Models}\n\n\\begin{abstract}\n  Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in expanding the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the incorporation of visual perception interfaces. Despite the emergence of exciting applications and the availability of diverse instruction tuning data, existing approaches often rely on CLIP or its variants as the visual branch, and merely extract features from the deep layers. However, these methods lack a comprehensive analysis of the visual encoders in MLLMs. In this paper, we conduct an extensive investigation into the effectiveness of different vision encoders within MLLMs. Our findings reveal that the shallow layer features of CLIP offer particular advantages for fine-grained tasks such as grounding and region understanding. Surprisingly, the vision-only model DINO, which is not pretrained with text-image alignment, demonstrates promising performance as a visual branch within MLLMs. By simply equipping it with an MLP layer for alignment, DINO surpasses CLIP in fine-grained related perception tasks. Building upon these observations, we propose a simple yet effective feature merging strategy, named \\textbf{COMM}, that integrates \\textbf{C}LIP and DIN\\textbf{O} with \\textbf{M}ulti-level features \\textbf{M}erging, to enhance the visual capabilities of MLLMs. We evaluate \\textbf{COMM} through comprehensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including image captioning, visual question answering, visual grounding, and object hallucination. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of \\textbf{COMM} compared to existing methods, showcasing its enhanced visual capabilities within MLLMs.\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\n\n\\label{sec:intro}\nLarge Language Models (LLMs)~\\cite{chatgpt, openai2023gpt4, touvron2023llama, llama2, taori2023stanford, chiangvicuna} have made significant strides in the domains of language understanding and generation, achieving remarkable progress recently. Through instruction tuning~\\cite{wei2021finetuned,wang2022self}, existing LLMs demonstrate their versatility as general-purpose models capable of handling a wide range of tasks. This capability unlocks their potential zero-shot learning ability, enabling seamless task switching guided by instructions. Building upon the promising performance of LLMs, researchers are now motivated to enhance their capabilities by incorporating visual signals as inputs. This extension allows the generation of textual outputs that are closely related to visual content, opening up exciting possibilities in the realm of vision-language understanding.\n\nTo this end, Flamingo~\\cite{alayrac2022flamingo} and BLIP2~\\cite{li2023blip2} align the powerful LLMs with a frozen visual encoder to understand visual inputs and perform various vision-language tasks. A series of following works, LLaVA~\\cite{liu2023llava}, InstructBLIP~\\cite{dai2023instructblip}, MiniGPT-4~\\cite{zhu2023minigpt} and mPLUG-OWL~\\cite{ye2023mplug} further improve the ability to follow human instructions by constructing multi-modal instruction-following datasets for training. However, these methods are built on image-level alignments, which suffer from the limited fine-grained understanding (such as region description~\\cite{liu2017referring} and reasoning~\\cite{zellers2019recognition}) and severe object hallucination problem~\\cite{li2023obj_Hallucination}. To this end, GPT4ROI~\\cite{zhang2023gpt4roi} proposes instruction tuning on region-of-interest and unlocks the region-level multimodal capacities. Kosmos-2~\\cite{peng2023kosmos} and Shikra~\\cite{chen2023shikra} further integrate the grounding abilities into LLMs and unlock the referential ability in dialogue, \\emph{i.e.}, enable the user to point to the object or region as input and the model responds with spatial coordinates of bounding boxes. Such grounding capacity can fulfill numerous vision-language tasks, which is a great progress in MLLMs.  \n\nDespite a wide variety of exciting methods and applications, most of existing multi-modal LLMs employ CLIP~\\cite{radford2021learning} or its variants ~\\cite{sun2023eva} as the visual branch, where the features output from the deep layers (\\emph{e.g.}, the penultimate layer) are usually employed as inputs to the language decoders. However, it still lacks analysis that: \\emph{Whether using the Vanilla CLIP features as visual encoder is the best way for MLLMs?} Though the visual encoder of CLIP is apparently well aligned with the word embedding space by image-text contrastive learning, it fails to learn more detailed pixel-level information such as color and positioning due to the global supervision of image captions, which might hinder the fine-grained perception ability in MLLMs. Besides, existing MLLMs have quite unbalanced visual and language encoders (\\emph{e.g.}, ViT-Large-300M vs. Vicuna-7B/13B). Since the language models have succeeded in scaling up the model size with progressively powerful language abilities, the short plate of the Buckets Effect for MLLMs lies in the visual models, which fails to demonstrate emerging capabilities, and suffer from domain gap and limited zero-shot ability. Consequently, it is critical to enhance the visual capabilities for boosting MLLMs. \n\nThis paper presents an extensive investigation into different visual encoders for MLLMs. Four typical visual foundation models are considered, \\emph{i.e.}, image-text contrastive learning CLIP, image-only contrastive learning DINOv2~\\cite{oquab2023dinov2}, masked image modeling MAE~\\cite{he2022masked} and supervised learning DeiT~\\cite{touvron2021training}. We evaluate the performance on commonly-used vision-language tasks including visual grounding, object hallucination, visual question answering, image captioning and MME benchmark. \nOur analysis reveals that different layers of features exhibit varying biases towards local and global patterns. Shallow layer features containing low-level detailed information prove beneficial for fine-grained perception tasks such as grounding and positioning ability, while deep layer features are superior at global understanding. To enhance representation, we propose a multi-level feature merging strategy that incorporates both low-level and high-level features. Surprisingly, when equipped with an MLP layer for alignment, the vision-only model DINOv2 shows promise as a visual branch for MLLMs. We attribute this to the fine-grained localization information captured by DINOv2. Conversely, MAE and DeiT perform inferiorly as visual branches for MLLMs. MAE learns limited semantic information, while DeiT's strong supervised training makes the alignment with the textual space challenging. Based on the above observations, we propose a fusion strategy that integrates \\textbf{C}LIP and DIN\\textbf{O} with \\textbf{M}ulti-level features \\textbf{M}erging), dubbed as \\textbf{COMM}, for boosting the visual branches of MLLMs.\nExperimental results demonstrate clear advantages of the proposed model over existing approaches and highlight the enhanced visual capabilities brought by \\textbf{COMM}. In a nutshell, the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We are the first to extensively investigate the effectiveness of different visual encoders for MLLMs. Based on the analysis that shallow layer features contain low-level detailed information which is helpful for fine-grained tasks, we propose a multi-level feature fusion strategy to incorporate low-level and high-level features for improving representation.\n    \\item Our analysis indicates that vision-only DINOv2 achieves promising results in MLLMs with only an MLP layer for alignment. Considering fine-grained pixel information in DINOv2 and global semantic information in CLIP, we propose \\textbf{COMM} to fuse the visual embeddings of these two models to enhance visual capabilities for boosting MLLMs.\n    \\item Extensive experiments on a wide range of tasks including visual grounding, referring expression generation, object hallucination, visual question answering and image captioning demonstrate the superiority of \\textbf{COMM} over existing works.\n\\end{itemize}\n\n\n\\section{Related Work}\n\n\\textbf{Multi-modal Large Language Model.} LLMs~\\cite{dai2019transformer,brown2020language} have garnered significant attention in both academia and industry due to their remarkable understanding and generative abilities. The success of LLMs has motivated researchers to explore the integration of vision into these models, leading to the development of powerful multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs). Flamingo~\\cite{alayrac2022flamingo} employs a cross-attention module to extract visual contexts, which are concatenated with text token as input for LLMs. LLaVA~\\cite{liu2023visual} and FROMAGe~\\cite{koh2023grounding} leverage the vision encoder of CLIP to extract visual features, which is aligned to text features using a single linear layer and then input to LLMs. Models such as BLIP-2~\\cite{li2023blip}, mPLUG-OWL~\\cite{ye2023mplug}, MiniGPT-4~\\cite{zhu2023minigpt} and InstructBLIP~\\cite{dai2023instructblip} employ Q-former to extract text-aligned visual features for LLMs. Recently, some interesting works extend LLMs to image retrieval~\\cite{koh2023grounding}, video understanding~\\cite{zhang2023video}, audio~\\cite{su2023pandagpt}, biomedical analysis~\\cite{li2023llava}, control systems~\\cite{driess2023palme}. \n\nIn recent studies, there has been a growing interest in extending MLLMs to improve their fine-grained understanding abilities through region-level image-text alignment. Kosmos-2~\\cite{peng2023kosmos} addresses this by constructing a large-scale dataset of grounded region-text pairs, enabling the integration of grounding abilities into LLMs. GPT4RoI~\\cite{zhang2023gpt4roi} reformulates the bounding box as a spatial instruction format and extracts visual features based on region-of-interest, facilitating region-level multi-modal understanding. Shikra~\\cite{chen2023shikra} proposes a unified model that handles spatial coordinates to possess referential abilities in dialogue contexts. Ferret~\\cite{you2023ferret} and ViP-LLaVA~\\cite{cai2023making} further extends with a broader range of free-form shapes for referring, including points, boxes, sketches and scribbles.\nAdditionally, Qwen~\\cite{Qwen-VL} presents a set of MLLMs that demonstrate remarkable performance across various tasks. However, previous works have predominantly focused on extracting visual features solely from the last few layers of the CLIP model, resulting in an emphasis on global image properties. In this study, we draw attention to the fact that features extracted from shallower layers exhibit a stronger focus on localized properties, which we argue can be more potent in comprehending object locations and image details. Additionally, while CLIP primarily learns globally aligned features, advanced vision-alone models such as DINOv2 excel in capturing more fine-grained vision features. We posit that leveraging these fine-grained vision features can effectively enhance the capabilities of MLLMs, as demonstrated in our analysis. To further advance this line of research, we introduce a novel fusion module that expands and enhances the visual branches, thereby aiming to significantly improve the performance of MLLMs.\n\n\\textbf{Large Vision Foundation Model.} Recent progresses in training vision foundation models with large-scale image data focus on contrastive learning, masked image modeling and supervised training. For one thing, contrastive learning can be conducted in an image-only or image-text manner. DINOv2~\\cite{oquab2023dinov2} pretrains the image encoder on large curated image data, which shows a superior understanding of object parts and scene geometry across image domains. Image-text contrastive learning as CLIP~\\cite{radford2021learning} and EVA-CLIP~\\cite{sun2023eva} employs the natural language as weak supervision to guide the learning of visual features. \nFor another, BEiT~\\cite{HangboBao2021BEiT} predicts discrete tokens based on a pre-trained image tokenizer while iBOT~\\cite{zhou2021ibot} proposes an online image tokenizer. MAE~\\cite{he2022masked} proposes a masked autoencoder for reconstructing image pixels. Besides, DeiT III~\\cite{Touvron2022DeiTIR} proposes a training recipe to achieve promising performance.\nRecent MLLMs employ the vision encoder of CLIP/EVA-CLIP without considering the properties of specific visual models. \nIn this paper, we are the first to re-examine the effectiveness of existing visual models in MLLMs and propose a simple yet effective fusion strategy for boosting visual capabilities.\n\n\n\\section{Analysis of the Visual Branch in MLLMs}\n\nPrevious MLLMs~\\cite{liu2023llava,liu2023improvedllava,zhu2023minigpt,dai2023instructblip,ye2023mplug,peng2023kosmos,chen2023shikra,Qwen-VL,you2023ferret} usually utilize the vision encoder of CLIP as their visual branch. Typically, these models extract features from the last few layers, such as the penultimate layer, which are then fed into an alignment network. Subsequently, the aligned features are concatenated with text tokens to serve as input for the LLMs. While the image-text pretraining of CLIP aligns well with the language model, it primarily learns image-level features but overlooks the richer pixel-level features due to the constraint of limited fine-grained information in the guided captions. Moreover, the deep-layer features primarily focus on global image properties and inadequately explore the intricate details of local object parts. As depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:feature}, the visual features extracted from the shallow layers of CLIP and the deep visual features obtained from the visual-only model DINOv2 contain more detailed information regarding local objects, such as shape or texture. Leveraging these detailed features may enhance the MLLMs' fine-grained perception abilities. \n\n\\textbf{Evaluation Settings.} For further analysis, we conduct a series of quantitative experiments using different kinds of visual models, \\emph{i.e.}, image-text contrastive learning CLIP, image-only contrastive learning DINOv2, masked image modeling MAE and supervised learning DeiT. In specific, the visual features extracted from different layers of visual models (based on ViT-Large) are aligned using a linear projection layer and then concatenated with text tokens as the input for LLMs (here we use Vicuna-7B~\\cite{chiangvicuna}). The overall architecture and training process follow Shikra~\\cite{chen2023shikra} but with fewer iterations (9400 iterations, batch size 16 on 4 A800) to save the computation cost. Then, we measure the capability of the trained MLLMs on referring expression comprehension (REC)~\\cite{chen2023shikra}, referring expression generation (REG)~\\cite{peng2023kosmos} and object hallucination benchmark (POPE)~\\cite{li2023obj_Hallucination}. \nDetailed descriptions of these tasks can be referred to Sec.~\\ref{sec:experiments}.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\renewcommand{\\baselinestretch}{1.0}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\textwidth]{feature.png}\n\\caption{Feature correspondence visualization by computing the cosine similarity of different visual tokens extracted from the shallow and deep layers of CLIP and DINOv2. }\\label{fig:feature}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\textbf{CLIP as the Visual Branch of MLLMs.} As depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:rec}, we observe that different layers of features exhibit varying biases towards grounding and understanding abilities. For instance, the shallow features demonstrate relatively higher accuracy in terms of REC and reach their optimal value at layer 12. Conversely, the deep features achieve higher accuracy in terms of POPE, indicating superior understanding ability. Notably, the relatively deep features (layer 16) display the best REG CIDEr score, showcasing promising region understanding capabilities. Consequently, instead of solely relying on deep features as done in previous works, we argue that integrating both shallow and deep features is crucial for MLLMs with improved overall performance.\n\nWe further explore various merging modes of low-level and high-level features. Denoting the output features from each transformer layer of ViT with a depth of $N$ as $\\mathbf{z}=[ z_1,..,z_i,...,z_N ]$, we discuss several multi-level feature merging (MFM) strategies for combining shallow and deep features, namely: \n\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{Mean(half)}: averaging output patch token features in the second half of the backbone as $z=(z_{N/2}+\\cdots+z_{N})/(N/2)$. \n\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{Mean(all)}: averaging features output by all layers as $z=(z_{1}+\\cdots+z_{N})/N$. \n\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{Layerscale(all)}: learning a scale parameter as the weight to sum features output by all layers as $z=w_1z_{1}+\\cdots+w_Nz_{N}$, where $w_i$ refers to the weight assigned to the $i$-th layer feature and all these weights are dynamically updated and summed up to 1. \n\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{LLN-Layerscale(all)}: using a linear-layernorm module to align the feature space between different layers\u2019 features and then summed by \\emph{Layerscale} as $z=w_1\\mathrm{LLN}(z_{1})+\\cdots+w_N\\mathrm{LLN}(z_{N})$.\n\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{Conv-Layerscale(all)}: using a convolution and bn module to align the feature space between different layers\u2019 features and then summed by \\emph{Layerscale} as $z=w_1\\mathrm{Conv}(z_{1})+\\cdots+w_N\\mathrm{Conv}(z_{N})$. \n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:clipanddino} (a) and (b) shows that simply averaging all shallow and deep features of CLIP can \\emph{de facto} achieve a satisfactory accuracy and \\emph{LLN-Layerscale} strategy further improves performance. With \\emph{LLN-Layerscale} as MFM module, the performance of CLIP can be evidently improved on commonly-used vision-language tasks as shown in Table~\\ref{tab:fusion}. \n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\renewcommand{\\baselinestretch}{1.0}\n\\centering\n \\subfloat[Average REC accuracy.]{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.33\\columnwidth]{analysis_rec2.png}}\n\\subfloat[Average POPE accuracy.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.33\\columnwidth]{analysis_pope2.png}}\n\\subfloat[Average REG CIDEr.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.33\\columnwidth]{analysis_reg2.png}}\n\\caption{Average REC, POPE accuracy and REG CIDEr for using different layers of features extracted from various vision models (CLIP, DINOv2 and MAE), as input to MLLMs. Shikra uses the 23rd layer features of CLIP and we reproduce its results with fewer iterations (denoted as Shikra$^*$).}\n\\label{fig:rec}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\renewcommand{\\baselinestretch}{1.0}\n\\centering\n \\subfloat[ REC acc for CLIP.]{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.26\\columnwidth]{recclip.png}}\n\\subfloat[ POPE acc for CLIP.]{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.248\\columnwidth]{popeclip.png}}\n\\subfloat[REC acc for DINO.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.247\\columnwidth,height=0.222\\columnwidth]{recdino.png}}\n\\subfloat[POPE acc for DINO.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.248\\columnwidth,height=0.222\\columnwidth]{popedino.png}}\n\\caption{Average REC and POPE accuracy for merging different layers of features with mutli-feature merging (MFM) strategies as input to MLLMs for visual backbones of CLIP and DINOv2. }\n\\label{fig:clipanddino}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\textbf{DINOv2 as the Visual Branch of MLLMs.} \nTo leverage the rich fine-grained visual information present in DINOv2, but not inherently aligned with text, we employ a non-linear Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) module to align the image features with the word embedding space. Fig.~\\ref{fig:rec}  demonstrates that the deep-layer features of DINOv2 exhibit superior grounding abilities, as evidenced by higher REC accuracy, and display satisfactory understanding abilities, as indicated by favorable POPE and REG results. Additionally, we explore the efficacy of multi-level feature merging to enhance performance. In contrast to CLIP, the merging of shallow features from DINOv2 leads to a significant performance degradation. Specifically, in Fig.~\\ref{fig:clipanddino}(c) and (d), it is evident that \\emph{Mean(all)} performs notably worse than \\emph{Mean(19-24)} in terms of both REC and POPE accuracy, indicating that the shallow representations lack sufficient semantic information. Building upon the \\emph{LLN-Layerscale} approach, the incorporation of the MLP module for a more potent connection between the visual and text spaces demonstrates a clear improvement in performance. Table~\\ref{tab:fusion} showcases the substantial performance gains achieved by employing \\emph{LLN-Layerscale-MLP} as Multi-Level Feature Merging (MFM) module across various vision language tasks. Further detailed ablation studies on the MLP module are in Section~\\ref{sec:mae}. \n\\begin{table}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{2.8pt}\n\\caption{Comparison of the visual model using CLIP, DINOv2 with Multi-level Feature Merging (MFM) and \\textbf{COMM} to incorporate visual embeddings of both models on VL tasks.

This is because MAE features lack sufficient semantic information for global or regional understanding. Therefore, MAE is not suitable as the visual branch for MLLMs. DeiT performs even worse than MAE (details in Section~\\ref{sec:mae}). We speculate that this is because supervised training is too strong, which learns a specialized visual space that is difficult to align with the word embedding space.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\renewcommand{\\baselinestretch}{1.0}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{overall2.pdf}\n\\caption{Overview of our \\textbf{COMM}.

Then the fused features are concatenated with text tokens as input to LLMs.}\n\\label{fig:overall}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\section{\\textbf{COMM}\n\n\\textbf{Architecture Overview.} In this section, we introduce the proposed \\textbf{COMM}, that integrates CLIP and DINO with Multi-level features Merging to enhance the visual capabilities of MLLMs. The overall framework is illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:overall}, \\textbf{COMM} is incorporated into a vision-language instruction following model built upon the\nrecent advanced language and vision-language foundation models. Following the input instructions, our model takes vision and language as inputs to generate text responses following the input instructions.\nSpecifically, we adopt the visual encoder of CLIP and DINOv2 (based on ViT-Large) with our proposed fusion strategy as the visual branch, and Vicuna~\\cite{chiangvicuna} (7B/13B) as language decoder. The visual encoder is downsampled with rate 14, meaning that an image with resolution $H\\times W$ will be represented by a sequence of $\\frac{H}{14}\\times \\frac{W}{14}$ tokens.\nThe fused token features are projected using a linear layer and then concatenated with the instruction tokens as inputs to the language decoder, which is a generic interface to unify various vision-language tasks as text generation task.\n\nSpecifically, denote the visual encoder of CLIP and DINOv2 (ViT Large used) as $f_1$ and $f_2$, respectively. Given an input image $x$, we extract the patch token features output by all layers of CLIP as $f_1(x)=[v_1^{1},...,v_1^{i},...,v_1^{24}]$, where $v_1^i \\in \\mathbf{R}^{N\\times D}$, $N$ is the number of patch tokens and $D$ is the embedding dimension. The features output by the deep layers of DINOv2 are $f_2(x)=[v_2^{19},...,v_2^{i},...,v_2^{24}]$. Then we concatenate the features output by these two models as $\\mathbf{v}=[v_1^{1},...,v_1^{24},v_2^{19},...,v_2^{24}]$. A linear-layernorm module is employed to align the feature space between different layers\u2019 features and layerscale is used to merge multiple layer features as\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\overline{v}_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{24} \\alpha_i \\cdot \\mathrm{Linear}(\\mathrm{LN}(v_1^{i})), \\qquad \\overline{v}_2 = \\sum_{j=19}^{24} \\beta_j \\cdot \\mathrm{Linear}(\\mathrm{LN}(v_2^{j}))\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the learnable scaling parameter. Then, we employ an MLP layer to project the features of DINOv2 and concatenate the output features with that of CLIP as $\\mathbf{\\overline{v}}=[\\overline{v}_1,\\mathrm{MLP}(\\overline{v}_2)]$. Then, a linear layer is employed to match the dimension of visual features to that of text features as $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}=\\mathrm{Linear}(\\mathbf{\\overline{v}})$. Finally, fused visual features $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}$ are concatenated with text tokens as input to LLMs.\n\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\n\\label{sec:experiments}\nIn this section, we conduct extensive evaluation on four kinds of vision-language tasks to comprehensively evaluate the visual understanding ability of our model, namely, Referring Expression Comprehension, Referring Expression Generation, Object Hallucination Benchmark, and Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning.\n\n\\textbf{Training Details.} Similar to previous MLLM methods, \\textbf{COMM} is trained in two stages. In the first pretraining stage, we train the model on the reorganized vision-language dataset as~\\cite{chen2023shikra}, including public VQA, Image Captioning datset and several datasets containing positional annotation RefCOCO, visual gemone~\\cite{krishna2017visualgenome} and Visual-7W~\\cite{mani2020pointqa}. The first pretraining stage is conducted for 100K steps. In the second instruction tuning stage, we set the sampling ratio to 50\\% on LLaVA-Instruct-150K~\\cite{liu2023llava} and Shikra-RD~\\cite{chen2023shikra}. Instead of 224 \u00d7 224 resolution currently used by existing MLLMs, we use 336 \u00d7 336 resolution to reduce the information loss caused by image down-sampling and promote the fine-grained perception ability. In both stages, we freeze the visual encoder and tune all parameters in LLMs, alignment layer and multi-level feature fusion module. We adopt AdamW~\\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/LoshchilovH19adamw} as the optimizer and cosine annealing\nscheduler~\\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/LoshchilovH17cos} as learning rate scheduler with an initial learning rate of\n2e-5 and global batch size of 64. All training runs on 8 NVIDIA A800 GPUs. It takes around 100h for stage one training and 20h for stage two.\n\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Results on standard referring expression comprehension (REC) task.

As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:rec}, compared with generalist VL models and previous SOTA MLLMs, \\textbf{COMM} achieves significant performance gain on all benchmarks, \\emph{i.e.}, \\textbf{COMM}-7B outperforms Shikra-13B and Qwen-VL-7B-Chat by 4.87\\% and 3.10\\% accuracy on average, respectively. With more powerful visual capabilities of our proposed fusion model, we can evidently surpass recent SOTA MLLMs in a more efficient way, \\emph{e.g.}, using a smaller LLM than Shikra (7B vs. 13B) and less training data than Qwen (3.6M vs. 1.4B). Besides, our generalist model even achieves comparable results with specialist SOTA methods, showing the superior grounding ability of our MLLMs.\n\n\\subsection{Referring Expression Generation}\nMoreover, we evaluate the ability to understand image regions or objects referred via inputting bounding boxes. Instead of referring image regions or objects via detailed text descriptions, directly referring to image regions via its bounding boxes is more effective and can reduce the ambiguity.\nThe experiments are conducted on the referring expression generation task with RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg, aiming to generate text descriptions of specific regions in the bounding box.

For VQA task, our model also shows significant advantages compared to other MLLMs. On VQAv2 val, dev and std, our model achieves 79.05, 81.04 and 81.17 accuracy respectively, which surpasses recent proposed Shikra with the same training data and procedure by a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of merging visual embeddings of DINOv2 and CLIP for enhancing visual capabilities. Besides, our \\textbf{COMM} model outperforms Qwen with 1.54 and 0.58 accuracy gain on VQAv2 dev and OK-VQA respectively with less VQA training data, \\emph{i.e.}, we use 0.6M and Qwen with 3.6M. Training with more VQA data might further improve performance and we leave it as future work.\n\\subsection{Ablation Study}\n\\label{sec:mae}\n\\textbf{Ablation on the MLP of DINOv2.} We conduct ablation study on the design of the MLP module in DINOv2 for aligning visual and text embedding space. \nWe ablate on the number and the expanding ratio of MLP module.\nTable~\\ref{tab:mlp} shows that increasing the number of MLP to 2 can evidently improve performance, demonstrate the effectiveness of using a more powerful network to align the vision only model DINOv2 to the word embedding space. However, increasing the number beyond 2 suffers the degraded performance. For the expanding ratio, increasing to 8 can improve performance, while increasing to 16 does not achieve significant performance gain. Moreover, we experiment with one linear layer, which suffers severe performance degradation. Thus, non-linear MLP is necessary for aligning the features of vision-only DINOv2 to the word embedding space.\n\n\\textbf{Ablation on the visual model of MAE and DeiT.} As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:deit}, MAE and DeiT suffers from evident performance degradation. For one thing, the visual features of MAE lack sufficient semantic information for global or regional understanding. For another, the supervised training of DeiT is so strong that it learns specialized visual space, making it difficult to align with the word embedding space. \n\\begin{table}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{2pt}\n\\caption{Ablation study on the number and expanding ratio of MLP module.

Furthermore, we recognize the potential of the vision-only model DINOv2, which leverages its inherent fine-grained pixel-level information for enhanced fine-grained perception in MLLMs when combined with an MLP layer for alignment purposes. Motivated by our analysis, we introduce a fusion approach to combine the visual features obtained from CLIP and DINOv2, thereby further augmenting the visual capabilities and performance of MLLMs. Through qualitative analysis and extensive quantitative experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the performance of existing MLLM models across diverse benchmark datasets. Looking ahead, we encourage future research to explore the integration of more powerful vision models to enhance the capabilities of visual branches in MLLMs. We believe that this avenue of investigation holds the key to unlocking the potential of the next generation of MLLMs.\n\n\n\n\n", "decision": "Reject", "review": [{"id": "2rsWAwpi1d", "rating": 6, "content": {"summary": "In this paper, authors try to use multi-level vision features and two vision backbones (CLIP and DINO) too boost the performance of current large multimodal models.

The core idea is to combine CLIP's image-text alignment capabilities with DINOv2's fine-grained visual representations. The authors propose a multi-level feature merging (MFM) strategy to integrate features from different layers of both encoders, aiming to enhance the model's performance on various vision-language tasks. Specifically, COMM employs a linear projection layer with layer normalization (LLN) and layer scaling to align and merge features from CLIP and DINOv2. For DINOv2, which lacks inherent text alignment, a non-linear multi-layer perceptron (MLP) module is used to align its features with the text embedding space. The authors conduct extensive experiments on a range of tasks, including visual question answering (VQA), image captioning, visual grounding, and object hallucination. The empirical results demonstrate that COMM generally outperforms existing MLLMs, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained visual understanding. The paper also includes ablation studies to analyze the impact of different feature merging strategies and the contribution of each visual encoder. The authors emphasize the importance of combining both low-level and high-level features for improved representation learning. Overall, the paper presents a compelling approach to integrating diverse visual encoders into MLLMs, showcasing the potential of combining contrastive and self-supervised learning for enhanced vision-language understanding. The findings suggest that leveraging the complementary strengths of different visual models can lead to significant performance gains in multimodal tasks. However, the paper also has some limitations, particularly in terms of the novelty of the approach and the scope of the experimental evaluation, which I will discuss in detail in the following sections.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nI found several aspects of this paper to be commendable. First, the core idea of combining CLIP and DINOv2 visual encoders is well-motivated. The authors correctly identify the strengths of each model: CLIP's strong image-text alignment and DINOv2's fine-grained visual representations. The proposed multi-level feature merging (MFM) strategy, while not entirely novel in its individual components, is a reasonable approach to integrate features from different layers of both encoders. The use of a non-linear MLP to align DINOv2's features with the text embedding space is a necessary step, given DINOv2's lack of inherent text alignment. The empirical results presented in the paper are generally strong, demonstrating that COMM outperforms existing MLLMs on a variety of tasks, including VQA, image captioning, visual grounding, and object hallucination. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the impact of different feature merging strategies and the contribution of each visual encoder. The authors also highlight the importance of combining both low-level and high-level features for improved representation learning, which is a well-established concept in computer vision. The paper is generally well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the proposed method and experimental setup. The authors also provide a detailed analysis of the performance of COMM on different tasks, which helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach. The inclusion of experiments on visual grounding and object hallucination is particularly valuable, as these tasks are often challenging for MLLMs. The paper also includes a detailed analysis of the performance of COMM on different tasks, which helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed approach. The inclusion of experiments on visual grounding and object hallucination is particularly valuable, as these tasks are often challenging for MLLMs. Finally, the paper's focus on fine-grained visual understanding is timely and relevant, given the increasing importance of this capability in many real-world applications.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the novelty of the proposed method is somewhat limited. While the authors combine CLIP and DINOv2, the core idea of merging multiple features from different encoders is not entirely new, as similar approaches have been explored in models like Qwen-VL. The paper acknowledges Qwen-VL but doesn't provide a direct comparison of the feature merging strategies, which would have been beneficial. The use of a simple MLP for aligning DINOv2 features, while effective, is also not a groundbreaking contribution. The paper's claim of being the 'first to extensively investigate the effectiveness of different visual encoders' is also debatable, as other works like Qwen-VL have also explored this area. This lack of clear novelty is a significant concern, as it diminishes the overall contribution of the paper. My confidence in this assessment is high, as the paper itself acknowledges the existence of similar approaches, and the lack of a direct comparison makes it difficult to ascertain the unique contribution of COMM's feature merging strategy. Second, the paper lacks a comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art MLLMs. While the authors compare COMM with several models, the selection is not always consistent across different tasks, and some recent models, such as MiniCPM-V, are missing. This makes it difficult to assess the true performance of COMM relative to the current state-of-the-art. Furthermore, the paper does not include comparisons with models that use the same ViT-Large backbone, which would have provided a more controlled comparison. This is a significant limitation, as it makes it difficult to isolate the impact of the proposed feature merging strategy from the impact of the backbone architecture. My confidence in this assessment is high, as the absence of key models and consistent comparisons is evident from the paper's tables. Third, the paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational cost of COMM. The authors do not provide information on the number of parameters, FLOPs, or inference time for COMM or the compared models. This is a critical omission, as the computational cost is a crucial factor in the practical applicability of any model. Without this information, it is difficult to assess the trade-off between performance and computational cost for COMM. My confidence in this assessment is high, as the absence of computational cost information is clear from the paper. Fourth, the paper does not adequately address the potential for redundancy when combining two powerful visual encoders. While the authors highlight the complementary strengths of CLIP and DINOv2, they do not provide a detailed analysis of the feature space to demonstrate that the combined features are indeed capturing distinct aspects of the visual input. This is a concern, as simply concatenating features from two models can lead to redundancy and increased computational cost without a corresponding increase in performance. My confidence in this assessment is medium, as the paper does provide some justification for the combination, but lacks a detailed analysis of feature redundancy. Fifth, the paper's claim that DINOv2 is not inherently aligned with text is not fully supported by the evidence. While DINOv2 is not trained with text-image pairs, it has been shown to possess emergent localization capabilities that could be leveraged for alignment. The paper does not explore the possibility of fine-tuning the MLP alignment layer with text-image pairs to leverage DINOv2's localization capabilities for better text alignment. This is a missed opportunity, as it could have led to improved performance. My confidence in this assessment is high, as the paper itself acknowledges DINOv2's localization capabilities, but does not explore their potential for text alignment. Finally, the paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of the COMM method. This is a significant omission, as it is important to understand the potential drawbacks and challenges of any proposed approach. My confidence in this assessment is high, as the absence of a dedicated limitations section is clear from the paper.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nBased on the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements for this paper. First, the authors should conduct a more thorough comparison with state-of-the-art MLLMs, including models like MiniCPM-V. The comparison should be consistent across all tasks, and the authors should try to control for the backbone architecture when comparing different feature merging strategies. This would provide a more accurate assessment of the performance of COMM relative to the current state-of-the-art. Second, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of COMM, including the number of parameters, FLOPs, and inference time. This information is crucial for assessing the practical applicability of the model. The authors should also compare the computational cost of COMM with other MLLMs. Third, the authors should conduct a more detailed analysis of the feature space to demonstrate that the combined features from CLIP and DINOv2 are indeed capturing distinct aspects of the visual input. This could involve visualizing the feature maps or using other techniques to analyze the feature representations. This would help to address the concern about potential redundancy. Fourth, the authors should explore the possibility of fine-tuning the MLP alignment layer with text-image pairs to leverage DINOv2's emergent localization capabilities for better text alignment. This could potentially lead to improved performance. The authors should also compare the performance of COMM with a version that uses a CLIP backbone with an expanded MLP module. Fifth, the authors should include a dedicated section discussing the limitations of the COMM method. This would provide a more balanced and realistic assessment of the proposed approach. Sixth, the authors should consider exploring more sophisticated feature fusion techniques beyond simple concatenation and linear projection. This could involve exploring attention-based fusion mechanisms or other non-linear methods. This could potentially lead to further performance improvements. Seventh, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the differences between COMM and other multi-branch MLLMs, such as Qwen-VL. This would help to clarify the unique contribution of COMM. Finally, the authors should consider conducting experiments on additional tasks, such as long-text captioning and multi-modal in-context learning, to further demonstrate the capabilities of COMM. These improvements would address the identified weaknesses and strengthen the overall contribution of the paper.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nI have several questions that arise from my analysis of this paper. First, what is the specific rationale for choosing the particular layers of CLIP and DINOv2 for feature merging? The paper mentions that shallow layers of CLIP are beneficial for grounding and positioning tasks, but a more detailed explanation of the layer selection process would be helpful. Second, how sensitive is the performance of COMM to the choice of the MLP architecture used for aligning DINOv2 features? The paper includes some ablation studies on the number and expanding ratio of the MLP layers, but a more thorough analysis of the MLP architecture would be beneficial. Third, what is the impact of the proposed feature merging strategy on the interpretability of the model? Does the combination of features from different encoders make it more difficult to understand how the model is making its predictions? Fourth, how does the performance of COMM scale with the size of the training data? Does the model benefit from larger training datasets, and how does this compare to other MLLMs? Fifth, what is the impact of the image resolution on the performance of COMM? Does the model benefit from higher resolution images, and how does this affect the computational cost? Sixth, how does the performance of COMM compare to other methods on more challenging visual reasoning tasks? Does the model exhibit any limitations in its ability to perform complex visual reasoning? Finally, what are the potential ethical implications of using a model like COMM, which combines multiple powerful visual encoders? Are there any potential biases or risks associated with the use of such a model? These questions target key uncertainties in the paper's methodology and seek clarification of critical assumptions, which would help to further understand the proposed approach.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n5.25\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n4.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}", "pred_standard_mode": "I will use Standard Mode for comprehensive thinking.

It presents an empirical study on the effectiveness of features at different layers of CLIP and DINOv2. A simple feature merging strategy is proposed to fuse CLIP and DINOv2 for better performance. Experiments are conducted on a wide range of benchmarks, including image captioning, visual question answering, visual grounding, and object hallucination.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n3\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The empirical study on the effectiveness of features at different layers of CLIP and DINOv2 is interesting.\n\n2. The proposed COMM has strong performance across a wide range of benchmarks.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n[1] EVA-CLIP: Improved Training Techniques for CLIP at Scale.\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The main contribution of this paper is rather limited. The proposed COMM for merging multi-level features from CLIP and DINO is rather straightforward. There are more advanced techniques for merging multi-level features, such as the one used in EVA-CLIP [r1].\n\n2. The analysis of different vision encoders is limited to CLIP and DINO. More recent and stronger vision encoders should be included for a comprehensive study, such as EVA-CLIP [r1].\n\n3. For the COMM merging design, why using shallow layer features of CLIP while using deep layer features of DINOv2? Have you tried other combinations, such as using deep layer features of CLIP and shallow layer features of DINOv2? Or using shallow and deep layer features of DINOv2 while keeping other settings the same?\n\n4. The COMM merging strategy is only applied to CLIP and DINOv2. It seems that it can be applied to other vision encoders. Have you tried other vision encoders?\n\n5. COMM is based on CLIP and DINOv2 which are pre-trained. Have you tried to train a new vision encoder from scratch using the COMM merging strategy, instead of using pre-trained CLIP and DINOv2?\n\n6. In Table 4, COMM achieves SOTA performance on VQAv2 and OK-VQA. However, this is not a fair comparison since the model is trained on a total of 4.6M VQA data (LLaVA-Instruct-600K + Shikra-RD-4M). Previous works, such as LLaVA, usually train the model on 600K VQA data. Have you tried to reduce the training data to 600K? How much VQA data is needed to achieve a good performance?\n\n7. In Table 4, the performance on image captioning lags behind recent works, such as LLaVA-1.5, which is based on BLIP-2. Why is that? The COMM merging design seems to be more suitable for visual question answering than image captioning.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper's core contribution, the COMM merging strategy, appears incremental given existing methods for fusing multi-level features. While the empirical study of different feature layers in CLIP and DINOv2 is valuable, the proposed merging technique lacks novelty and sophistication compared to methods like those found in EVA-CLIP. The paper should explore more advanced fusion techniques, such as attention-based mechanisms or learnable fusion weights, to demonstrate a more significant advancement over the current approach. Furthermore, the current approach of using shallow layers of CLIP and deep layers of DINOv2 is not thoroughly justified. A more comprehensive exploration of different layer combinations, including using deep layers of CLIP and shallow layers of DINOv2, or even using only DINOv2 features, is needed to understand the optimal configuration and the specific contributions of each feature type. The lack of ablation studies on these combinations makes it difficult to assess the true value of the proposed merging strategy.\n\nThe study's scope is limited by its focus on CLIP and DINOv2. To provide a more comprehensive analysis, the paper should include more recent and powerful vision encoders, such as EVA-CLIP, which have demonstrated superior performance in various vision tasks. The current analysis does not sufficiently justify why these other encoders were not considered, especially given their reported improvements over CLIP. The paper should also investigate the applicability of the COMM merging strategy to these other encoders to demonstrate its generalizability and potential for broader impact. The lack of such analysis limits the conclusions that can be drawn about the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to other state-of-the-art vision encoders and merging techniques.\n\nFinally, the experimental setup raises concerns about the fairness of the comparisons. The model is trained on a significantly larger VQA dataset (4.6M) compared to previous works (600K), which makes it difficult to isolate the impact of the proposed COMM merging strategy. The paper should include experiments where the training data is reduced to 600K to allow for a more direct comparison with existing methods. Additionally, the performance on image captioning is noticeably lower than recent works, suggesting that the COMM merging strategy might be more suited for VQA than captioning. The paper should investigate this discrepancy and explore potential reasons why the proposed approach does not perform as well on captioning tasks. This could involve analyzing the types of features that are most relevant for each task and adjusting the merging strategy accordingly.\n\n### Questions\n\nSee above.\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n5\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper investigates the effectiveness of different visual encoders within MLLMs. The authors find that the shallow layer features of CLIP offer particular advantages for fine-grained tasks such as grounding and region understanding. Surprisingly, the vision-only model DINO demonstrates promising performance as a visual branch within MLLMs. By simply equipping it with an MLP layer for alignment, DINO surpasses CLIP in fine-grained related perception tasks. The authors propose a simple yet effective feature merging strategy, named COMM, that integrates CLIP and DINO with Multi-level features Merging, to enhance the visual capabilities of MLLMs. The COMM is evaluated on a wide range of benchmarks, including image captioning, visual question answering, visual grounding, and object hallucination.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\n1.

The motivation is clear and reasonable.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n[1] Improved baselines with visual instruction tuning.\n[2] Making large language models better multi-modal learners, instructors and evaluators.\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The COMM is based on CLIP and DINO, which are pre-trained. Have you tried to train a new vision encoder from scratch using the COMM merging strategy, instead of using pre-trained CLIP and DINO? This could provide insights into the effectiveness of the COMM architecture itself, independent of the pre-training of CLIP and DINO. It would be beneficial to see experiments that explore this, perhaps by training a joint model with a similar architecture to COMM but with randomly initialized weights, and comparing its performance to the pre-trained version.\n\n2. In Table 4, COMM achieves SOTA performance on VQAv2 and OK-VQA. However, this is not a fair comparison since the model is trained on a total of 4.6M VQA data (LLaVA-Instruct-600K + Shikra-RD-4M). Previous works, such as LLaVA, usually train the model on 600K VQA data. Have you tried to reduce the training data to 600K? How much VQA data is needed to achieve a good performance? The impact of the increased training data on the performance gains should be quantified. It would be helpful to see a learning curve that shows the performance of COMM with varying amounts of training data, to understand the data efficiency of the proposed method.\n\n3. In Table 4, the performance on image captioning lags behind recent works, such as LLaVA-1.5, which is based on BLIP-2. Why is that? The COMM merging design seems to be more suitable for visual question answering than image captioning. The paper should provide a more detailed analysis of why the COMM architecture might be less effective for image captioning tasks compared to VQA. Are there specific characteristics of the captioning task that make it harder for the COMM model? For example, does the multi-level feature merging strategy introduce noise or irrelevant information for caption generation?\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper presents a compelling approach to multi-modal learning by combining CLIP and DINO features. However, several aspects could be strengthened to provide a more complete picture of the method's effectiveness and limitations. First, the reliance on pre-trained models raises questions about the true contribution of the COMM architecture. While using pre-trained models is common, it is crucial to understand how much of the performance gain is due to the pre-training itself versus the proposed merging strategy. To address this, the authors should consider conducting experiments where the COMM architecture is trained from scratch with randomly initialized weights. This would involve training a model with the same architecture as COMM, but without using pre-trained CLIP and DINO weights. This would provide a clearer understanding of the effectiveness of the COMM architecture itself. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to compare the performance of this randomly initialized COMM model with the pre-trained version to quantify the contribution of pre-training. Such an analysis would provide a more robust evaluation of the proposed method.\n\nSecond, the paper needs a more thorough investigation into the impact of training data size on the performance of COMM, especially for VQA tasks. The current results show that COMM achieves state-of-the-art performance on VQAv2 and OK-VQA, but this is potentially confounded by the larger training dataset used. To address this, the authors should conduct experiments where the training data is varied, including a condition where the training data is reduced to 600K, which is the amount used in previous works like LLaVA. This would allow for a more direct comparison with existing methods and help to understand the data efficiency of COMM. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a learning curve that shows the performance of COMM with varying amounts of training data. This would provide insights into how much data is needed to achieve good performance and whether the COMM architecture is more or less data-efficient than other methods. Such an analysis would help to determine if the performance gains are due to the architecture or simply due to the increased training data.\n\nFinally, the paper should provide a more detailed analysis of why the COMM architecture might be less effective for image captioning tasks compared to VQA. The current results show that COMM lags behind recent works like LLaVA-1.5 on image captioning, and the paper suggests that the COMM merging design might be more suitable for VQA. However, this explanation is not sufficient. The authors should investigate the specific characteristics of the captioning task that make it harder for the COMM model. For example, does the multi-level feature merging strategy introduce noise or irrelevant information for caption generation? Are there specific types of images or captions where COMM performs poorly? A more detailed analysis of these questions would provide a better understanding of the limitations of the COMM architecture and suggest potential avenues for improvement. This could involve analyzing the attention maps or feature representations to understand what information is being used by the model for caption generation.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease see the weaknesses.\n\n### Rating\n\n6\n\n### Confidence\n\n4\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 3\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper presents a comprehensive investigation into the effectiveness of different visual encoders within MLLMs. The authors find that shallow layer features of CLIP offer advantages for fine-grained tasks, while the vision-only model DINO demonstrates promising performance when equipped with an MLP layer for alignment.

Evidence Collection:\nb) Experiment-related Evidence (if applicable):\n   - The paper explicitly states in the \"Training Details\" section: \"Similar to previous MLLM methods, \\textbf{COMM} is trained in two stages. In the first pretraining stage, we train the model on the reorganized vision-language dataset as~\\cite{chen2023shikra}, including public VQA, Image Captioning datset and several datasets containing positional annotation RefCOCO, visual gemone~\\cite{krishna2017visualgenome} and Visual-7W~\\cite{mani2020pointqa}. The first pretraining stage is conducted for 100K steps. In the second instruction tuning stage, we set the sampling ratio to 50\\% on LLaVA-Instruct-150K~\\cite{liu2023llava} and Shikra-RD~\\cite{chen2023shikra}. Instead of 224 \u00d7 224 resolution currently used by existing MLLMs, we use 336 \u00d7 336 resolution to reduce the information loss caused by image down-sampling and promote the fine-grained perception ability. In both stages, we freeze the visual encoder and tune all parameters in LLMs, alignment layer and multi-level feature fusion module.\"\n   - The \"Architecture Overview\" section describes the COMM framework: \"Specifically, we adopt the visual encoder of CLIP and DINOv2 (based on ViT-Large) with our proposed fusion strategy as the visual branch, and Vicuna~\\cite{chiangvicuna} (7B/13B) as language decoder. The visual encoder is downsampled with rate 14, meaning that an image with resolution $H\\times W$ will be represented by a sequence of $\\frac{H}{14}\\times \\frac{W}{14}$ tokens.\" This clearly indicates the use of pre-trained CLIP and DINOv2.\n\n3. Literature Gap Analysis:\n   - The paper does not discuss or cite works that explore training multi-modal models with jointly trained vision encoders from scratch.\n\n4. Validation Analysis:\n   - The reviewer correctly points out that the COMM model relies on pre-trained CLIP and DINOv2. The paper explicitly states that the visual encoders are frozen during training. There are no experiments reported where a new vision encoder is trained from scratch using the COMM merging strategy. This limits the understanding of the COMM architecture's effectiveness independent of the pre-training.\n\n5.

Validation Analysis:\n   - The reviewer is correct that the paper doesn't explicitly state the total VQA training data size but implies it's larger than the 600K used in some previous works due to the use of LLaVA-Instruct-150K and Shikra-RD. The paper lacks experiments with reduced training data to assess the impact of data size on performance and doesn't provide a learning curve to show performance with varying data amounts.\n\n5.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces COMM, a novel multi-modal large language model (MLLM) architecture that leverages a multi-level feature merging strategy to integrate the strengths of CLIP and DINOv2 visual encoders. The authors' core contribution lies in their empirical investigation of different visual encoders within MLLMs, revealing that shallow layer features of CLIP are particularly effective for fine-grained tasks like visual grounding, while DINOv2, when equipped with an MLP alignment layer, excels in fine-grained perception tasks. The proposed COMM architecture addresses this by merging multi-level features from both CLIP and DINOv2, aiming to enhance the visual capabilities of MLLMs. Specifically, COMM extracts features from all 24 layers of CLIP, aligns them using a linear-layernorm module, and merges them using a layerscale approach. For DINOv2, features from layers 19 to 24 are aligned using an MLP layer and then concatenated with the CLIP features. The final fused features are projected using a linear layer to match the dimension of text features. The authors evaluate COMM on a wide range of benchmarks, including image captioning, visual question answering, visual grounding, and object hallucination. The results demonstrate that COMM achieves strong performance across these tasks, particularly in visual question answering, where it achieves state-of-the-art results on VQAv2 and OK-VQA. The paper also includes an analysis of different visual encoders, showing that MAE and DeiT perform worse than CLIP and DINOv2 in the context of MLLMs. The authors further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-level feature merging strategy. Overall, this paper presents a well-motivated and empirically supported approach to improving the visual capabilities of MLLMs by combining the strengths of different visual encoders through a multi-level feature merging strategy. The findings suggest that carefully combining features from different layers of complementary visual models can lead to significant performance gains in various vision-language tasks.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.5\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nThis paper presents a compelling approach to multi-modal learning by combining CLIP and DINOv2 features, demonstrating a clear understanding of the strengths of each model. The empirical study on the effectiveness of features at different layers of CLIP and DINOv2 is a significant strength, providing valuable insights into how different layers contribute to various vision-language tasks. The finding that shallow layer features of CLIP are beneficial for fine-grained tasks, while DINOv2 excels in perception tasks when aligned with an MLP, is particularly noteworthy. The proposed COMM architecture effectively leverages these insights by merging multi-level features from both models, leading to strong performance across a wide range of benchmarks. The paper's experimental results are impressive, with COMM achieving state-of-the-art performance on VQAv2 and OK-VQA, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed feature merging strategy. The inclusion of ablation studies further strengthens the paper by validating the design choices and the contribution of the multi-level feature merging strategy. The paper is also well-written and easy to follow, making the methodology and findings accessible to a broad audience. The motivation for the work is clear and reasonable, addressing a critical need for improved visual capabilities in MLLMs. The authors have successfully demonstrated that combining the strengths of different visual encoders through a multi-level feature merging strategy can lead to significant performance gains in various vision-language tasks. The paper's focus on empirical analysis and thorough evaluation of the proposed method makes it a valuable contribution to the field of multi-modal learning.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nWhile the paper presents a strong empirical study and achieves impressive results, several limitations warrant careful consideration. First, the COMM architecture relies heavily on pre-trained CLIP and DINOv2 models, which are kept frozen during training. This reliance on pre-trained models, while practical, limits the exploration of the COMM merging strategy's potential when applied to vision encoders trained from scratch. As the paper states in the 'Training Details' section, 'In both stages, we freeze the visual encoder and tune all parameters in LLMs, alignment layer and multi-level feature fusion module.' This approach makes it difficult to isolate the impact of the merging strategy itself from the pre-existing knowledge embedded in CLIP and DINOv2. The paper lacks any experiments where a new vision encoder is trained from scratch using the COMM merging strategy, which would provide a clearer understanding of the architecture's effectiveness independent of the pre-training. This is a significant limitation, as it prevents a full assessment of the COMM architecture's generalizability and its potential when applied to different vision encoder architectures. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper explicitly states the use of pre-trained and frozen encoders and lacks any experiments to address this concern. Second, the paper's VQA results, while achieving state-of-the-art performance, are potentially confounded by the use of a significantly larger training dataset compared to previous works. The 'Training Details' section mentions the use of LLaVA-Instruct-150K and Shikra-RD for instruction tuning, which implies a larger training dataset than the 600K VQA data used in works like LLaVA. The paper does not explicitly state the total amount of VQA data used, but the inclusion of these datasets suggests a substantial increase. This makes it difficult to determine whether the performance gains are due to the proposed method or simply a result of the increased training data. The paper lacks experiments where the training data is reduced to 600K, which would allow for a more direct comparison with existing methods. Furthermore, the paper does not include a learning curve to show the performance of COMM with varying amounts of training data, which would be valuable in understanding the data efficiency of the proposed approach. This lack of control over the training data size makes it difficult to isolate the contribution of the COMM merging strategy. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not provide a direct comparison with previous works using the same training data size and lacks experiments with varying training data amounts. Third, the paper's performance on image captioning lags behind recent works, such as LLaVA-1.5, which is based on BLIP-2. As shown in Table 4, COMM achieves good performance on image captioning tasks, but it does not surpass all recent works. The paper lacks a detailed analysis of why the COMM architecture might be less effective for image captioning tasks compared to VQA. The paper suggests that the COMM merging design might be more suitable for VQA, but this explanation is not sufficient. There is no investigation into whether the multi-level feature merging strategy introduces noise or irrelevant information for caption generation, or whether there are specific characteristics of the captioning task that make it harder for the COMM model. This lack of analysis limits the understanding of the COMM architecture's limitations and its applicability to different vision-language tasks. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper's results in Table 4 show a clear performance gap in image captioning, and the paper lacks a detailed analysis to explain this discrepancy. Finally, the paper's analysis of different vision encoders is limited to CLIP, DINOv2, MAE, and DeiT. The paper does not include an analysis of more recent and potentially stronger vision encoders, such as EVA-CLIP, which have demonstrated superior performance in various vision tasks. This limits the comprehensiveness of the study and raises questions about whether the proposed COMM architecture would be as effective with other state-of-the-art vision encoders. The paper also lacks experiments exploring different combinations of layers from CLIP and DINOv2, focusing instead on different merging methods. This limits the understanding of the optimal layer combinations for different tasks. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper explicitly states the encoders analyzed and lacks experiments with other state-of-the-art encoders or different layer combinations.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should conduct experiments where the COMM architecture is trained from scratch with a randomly initialized vision encoder. This would involve training a model with the same architecture as COMM, but without using pre-trained CLIP and DINOv2 weights. This would provide a clearer understanding of the effectiveness of the COMM architecture itself, independent of the pre-training. Furthermore, exploring different pre-training strategies for the vision encoder, such as contrastive learning or masked image modeling, could provide insights into the optimal conditions for COMM's effectiveness. This analysis would strengthen the paper's claims about the generalizability of the COMM approach and its applicability to various vision encoder architectures. Second, the authors should conduct experiments with a reduced training dataset for VQA tasks, comparable to that used in prior works like LLaVA (600K VQA data). This would allow for a more direct comparison and provide a clearer understanding of the actual contribution of the COMM merging strategy. Additionally, a detailed analysis of the learning curves and performance trends with varying amounts of training data would be valuable in determining the data efficiency of the proposed approach. This analysis should also explore the impact of different data augmentation techniques on the performance of COMM with reduced training data. The authors should also consider reporting results with a training dataset size of 600K to allow for a more direct comparison with existing methods. Third, the authors should investigate the reasons behind the observed performance gap in image captioning compared to models like LLaVA-1.5. This could involve analyzing the feature representations learned by COMM and comparing them to those of models that perform well on image captioning. This analysis could reveal whether the multi-level feature merging strategy is introducing noise or irrelevant information for caption generation. Furthermore, exploring alternative merging strategies or modifications to the COMM architecture specifically for image captioning could potentially improve its performance on this task. This could involve incorporating attention mechanisms or other techniques that are known to be effective for sequence generation tasks. Fourth, the authors should include an analysis of more recent and stronger vision encoders, such as EVA-CLIP, to provide a more comprehensive study. This would help to determine whether the proposed COMM architecture would be as effective with other state-of-the-art vision encoders. The authors should also explore different combinations of layers from CLIP and DINOv2, including using deep layers of CLIP and shallow layers of DINOv2, or using only DINOv2 features. This would help to understand the optimal layer combinations for different tasks. Finally, the authors should consider applying the COMM merging strategy to other vision encoders to demonstrate its generalizability and potential for broader impact. This would help to show that the COMM merging strategy is not limited to CLIP and DINOv2 and can be applied to other vision encoders to improve their performance in MLLMs. These changes would strengthen the paper's claims and provide a more complete understanding of the proposed method's effectiveness and limitations.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nSeveral key questions arise from my analysis of this paper. First, given the reliance on pre-trained CLIP and DINOv2 models, what is the true contribution of the COMM merging strategy independent of the pre-existing knowledge embedded in these models? How would the performance of COMM change if the vision encoders were trained from scratch using the same architecture and training procedure? Second, how does the increased training data size for VQA tasks impact the performance gains achieved by COMM? What is the data efficiency of the proposed approach, and how much VQA data is needed to achieve a good performance? Would the performance of COMM be comparable to other methods if trained on a smaller dataset? Third, why does the COMM architecture lag behind recent works on image captioning, and what specific characteristics of the captioning task make it harder for the COMM model? Does the multi-level feature merging strategy introduce noise or irrelevant information for caption generation? Fourth, how would the performance of COMM change if more recent and stronger vision encoders, such as EVA-CLIP, were used? Would the proposed merging strategy be as effective with other state-of-the-art vision encoders? Fifth, what is the optimal combination of layers from CLIP and DINOv2 for different vision-language tasks? Have the authors explored other combinations of layers, such as using deep layers of CLIP and shallow layers of DINOv2, or using only DINOv2 features? Finally, how does the COMM merging strategy compare to more advanced feature merging techniques, such as those used in EVA-CLIP? Would incorporating attention-based mechanisms or learnable fusion weights improve the performance of COMM? These questions highlight key uncertainties and areas for further investigation that would strengthen the paper's conclusions and provide a more complete understanding of the proposed method.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n5.25\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n4.25\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}", "pred_best_mode": {"step1_output": "I will use Best Mode for comprehensive thinking.

Next, I will not stop my thinking, and I will conduct a detailed analysis of the entire paper:\n\n\\boxed_analysis{\nThis paper presents a compelling investigation into the role of visual encoders within Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a field that has seen rapid advancements. The authors rightly point out that while LLMs have achieved remarkable success in language tasks, their integration with visual information has largely relied on CLIP-like models, often without a deep exploration of alternative visual encoders or the specific contributions of different feature layers. This work addresses this gap by systematically analyzing various visual encoders and their feature representations, challenging the implicit assumption that CLIP is the optimal choice. The motivation is clear: to enhance the fine-grained visual understanding and reduce object hallucination in MLLMs, which are crucial for tasks requiring detailed visual perception. The core idea revolves around the observation that different layers of visual encoders capture distinct types of information, with shallow layers encoding low-level details and deep layers encoding high-level semantics. The authors propose that combining these complementary features can lead to improved performance, a concept that is intuitively sound. They introduce COMM, a method that fuses features from CLIP and DINOv2, leveraging CLIP's semantic understanding and DINOv2's fine-grained visual information. This fusion strategy, which includes a linear-layernorm module and a learnable scaling parameter, is designed to align the feature spaces of the two models. The inclusion of an MLP layer for DINOv2's features is a crucial step for aligning its visual features with the textual embedding space. The authors' approach is comprehensive, covering the analysis of visual encoders, the design of a feature merging strategy, and the empirical evaluation of the proposed method. \n\nThe methodology is well-structured, beginning with an analysis of visual encoders, where the authors evaluate CLIP, DINOv2, MAE, and DeiT on vision-language tasks. The finding that shallow layers of CLIP are beneficial for fine-grained tasks while deep layers excel in global understanding is insightful. The observation that DINOv2, a vision-only model, performs surprisingly well with alignment is a key contribution. The multi-level feature merging (MFM) strategy is central to COMM, and the use of linear-layernorm and learnable scaling parameters for feature alignment and merging is a reasonable approach. The MLP layer for DINOv2 alignment is a practical solution for bridging the modality gap. The COMM architecture integrates CLIP and DINOv2 with the MFM strategy, and the two-stage training process is standard practice in MLLMs. The workflow description provides a clear overview of the model's operation. The experimental design is thorough, with evaluations on Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), Referring Expression Generation (REG), Object Hallucination Benchmark (POPE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Image Captioning. The choice of datasets and metrics is appropriate for each task, and the results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of COMM compared to baselines. The ablation study on the MLP module provides valuable insights into its design choices, and the ablation study on MAE and DeiT further supports the authors' claim about the suitability of CLIP and DINOv2. The results are compelling, showing that COMM achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, particularly in fine-grained tasks and in reducing object hallucination. The ablation studies provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed MFM strategy and the choice of visual encoders. The practical implication is a clear pathway for improving the visual capabilities of MLLMs. The generalizability of the findings is supported by the consistent improvements across different tasks and datasets. \n\nWhile the paper makes significant contributions, there are areas for further exploration. The theoretical understanding of why DINOv2, a vision-only model, performs so well in a multi-modal context could be further investigated. The MFM strategy, while effective, is relatively simple, and exploring more sophisticated fusion techniques could lead to further improvements. The reliance on ViT-Large models raises questions about computational cost and scalability. The comparison with baselines could be more rigorous, ensuring that all models are trained and evaluated under comparable conditions. The ablation studies could be expanded to investigate the impact of different layer combinations from CLIP and DINOv2. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of failure cases to understand the limitations of the proposed approach. Future work could explore the theoretical connections between self-supervised learning in DINOv2 and its effectiveness in MLLMs, develop more adaptive feature merging strategies, investigate different pre-training objectives, and explore techniques to reduce the computational cost of COMM.  Additionally, applying COMM to other multi-modal tasks, integrating it with other types of foundation models, and optimizing the implementation for efficiency are all promising directions. Despite these potential improvements, the paper makes a significant contribution by highlighting the importance of carefully selecting and combining visual encoders in MLLMs and providing a practical and effective method for doing so.}\n\nNow, please tell me the answers to the three questions from the recent search.", "questions": ["What are the key technical approaches used in previous multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for integrating visual and textual information, and how do these approaches differ in terms of their architectural design and training methodologies?", "How have existing solutions to the object hallucination problem in MLLMs evolved over time, and what are the current limitations and challenges in mitigating this issue?", "What are the primary limitations of using image-text contrastive learning models like CLIP as the visual branch in MLLMs, and how do these limitations affect the model's performance on fine-grained vision-language tasks?"], "retrieval": [{"final_passages": "[0] Title: Textual Knowledge Matters: Cross-Modality Co-Teaching for Generalized Visual Class Discovery Text: In this paper, we study the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), which aims to cluster unlabeled data from both known and unknown categories using the knowledge of labeled data from known categories. Current GCD methods rely on only visual cues, which however neglect the multi-modality perceptive nature of human cognitive processes in discovering novel visual categories. To address this, we propose a two-phase TextGCD framework to accomplish multi-modality GCD by exploiting powerful Visual-Language Models. TextGCD mainly includes a retrieval-based text generation (RTG) phase and a cross-modality co-teaching (CCT) phase. First, RTG constructs a visual lexicon using category tags from diverse datasets and attributes from Large Language Models, generating descriptive texts for images in a retrieval manner. Second, CCT leverages disparities between textual and visual modalities to foster mutual learning, thereby enhancing visual GCD. In addition, we design an adaptive class aligning strategy to ensure the alignment of category perceptions between modalities as well as a soft-voting mechanism to integrate multi-modality cues. Experiments on eight datasets show the large superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach outperforms the best competitor, by 7.7% and 10.8% in All accuracy on ImageNet-1k and CUB, respectively.\n[1] Title: VITA-1.5: Towards GPT-4o Level Real-Time Vision and Speech Interaction Text: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have typically focused on integrating visual and textual modalities, with less emphasis placed on the role of speech in enhancing interaction. However, speech plays a crucial role in multimodal dialogue systems, and implementing high-performance in both vision and speech tasks remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental modality differences. In this paper, we propose a carefully designed multi-stage training methodology that progressively trains LLM to understand both visual and speech information, ultimately enabling fluent vision and speech interaction. Our approach not only preserves strong vision-language capacity, but also enables efficient speech-to-speech dialogue capabilities without separate ASR and TTS modules, significantly accelerating multimodal end-to-end response speed. By comparing our method against state-of-the-art counterparts across benchmarks for image, video, and speech tasks, we demonstrate that our model is equipped with both strong visual and speech capabilities, making near real-time vision and speech interaction.\n[2] Title: Retrieval-based Knowledge Augmented Vision Language Pre-training Text: With the recent progress in large-scale vision and language representation learning, Vision Language Pre-training (VLP) models have achieved promising improvements on various multi-modal downstream tasks. Albeit powerful, these models have not fully leveraged world knowledge to their advantage. A key challenge of knowledge-augmented VLP is the lack of clear connections between knowledge and multi-modal data. Moreover, not all knowledge present in images/texts is useful, therefore prior approaches often struggle to effectively integrate knowledge, visual, and textual information. In this study, we propose REtrieval-based knowledge Augmented Vision Language (REAVL), a novel knowledge-augmented pre-training framework to address the above issues. For the first time, we introduce a knowledge-aware self-supervised learning scheme that efficiently establishes the correspondence between knowledge and multi-modal data and identifies informative knowledge to improve the modeling of alignment and interactions between visual and textual modalities. By adaptively integrating informative knowledge with visual and textual information, REAVL achieves new state-of-the-art performance uniformly on knowledge-based vision-language understanding and multi-modal entity linking tasks, as well as competitive results on general vision-language tasks while only using 0.2% pre-training data of the best models. Our model shows strong sample efficiency and effective knowledge utilization.\n[3] Title: GPT-4 Enhanced Multimodal Grounding for Autonomous Driving: Leveraging Cross-Modal Attention with Large Language Models Text: In the field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), accurately discerning commander intent and executing linguistic commands within a visual context presents a significant challenge. This paper introduces a sophisticated encoder-decoder framework, developed to address visual grounding in AVs.Our Context-Aware Visual Grounding (CAVG) model is an advanced system that integrates five core encoders-Text, Image, Context, and Cross-Modal-with a Multimodal decoder. This integration enables the CAVG model to adeptly capture contextual semantics and to learn human emotional features, augmented by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-4. The architecture of CAVG is reinforced by the implementation of multi-head cross-modal attention mechanisms and a Region-Specific Dynamic (RSD) layer for attention modulation. This architectural design enables the model to efficiently process and interpret a range of cross-modal inputs, yielding a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between verbal commands and corresponding visual scenes. Empirical evaluations on the Talk2Car dataset, a real-world benchmark, demonstrate that CAVG establishes new standards in prediction accuracy and operational efficiency. Notably, the model exhibits exceptional performance even with limited training data, ranging from 50% to 75% of the full dataset. This feature highlights its effectiveness and potential for deployment in practical AV applications. Moreover, CAVG has shown remarkable robustness and adaptability in challenging scenarios, including long-text command interpretation, low-light conditions, ambiguous command contexts, inclement weather conditions, and densely populated urban environments. The code for the proposed model is available at our Github.\n[4] Title: SPHINX: The Joint Mixing of Weights, Tasks, and Visual Embeddings for Multi-modal Large Language Models Text: We present SPHINX, a versatile multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with a joint mixing of model weights, tuning tasks, and visual embeddings. First, for stronger vision-language alignment, we unfreeze the large language model (LLM) during pre-training, and introduce a weight mix strategy between LLMs trained by real-world and synthetic data. By directly integrating the weights from two domains, the mixed LLM can efficiently incorporate diverse semantics with favorable robustness. Then, to enable multi-purpose capabilities, we mix a variety of tasks for joint visual instruction tuning, and design task-specific instructions to avoid inter-task conflict. In addition to the basic visual question answering, we include more challenging tasks such as region-level understanding, caption grounding, document layout detection, and human pose estimation, contributing to mutual enhancement over different scenarios. Additionally, we propose to extract comprehensive visual embeddings from various network architectures, pre-training paradigms, and information granularity, providing language models with more robust image representations. Based on our proposed joint mixing, SPHINX exhibits superior multi-modal understanding capabilities on a wide range of applications. On top of this, we further propose an efficient strategy aiming to better capture fine-grained appearances of high-resolution images. With a mixing of different scales and high-resolution sub-images, SPHINX attains exceptional visual parsing and reasoning performance on existing evaluation benchmarks. We hope our work may cast a light on the exploration of joint mixing in future MLLM research. Code is released at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/LLaMA2-Accessory.\n[5] Title: Video description with integrated visual and textual information Text: Video Description aims to automatically generate descriptive natural language for videos. Due to the large volume of multi-modal data and successful implementations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a wide range of models have been proposed. However, previous models learn insufficient linguistic information or correlation between visual and textual modalities. In order to address those problems, this paper proposes an integrated model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). This proposed model consists of triple channels in parallel: a primary video description channel, a sentence-to-sentence channel for language learning, and a channel to integrate visual and textual information. Additionally, the parallel three channels are connected by LSTM weight matrices during training. The VD-ivt model is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, i.e. Youtube2Text and LS-MDC. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model outperforms those benchmarks.\n[6] Title: HiVLP: Hierarchical Interactive Video-Language Pre-Training Text: Video-Language Pre-training (VLP) has become one of the most popular research topics in deep learning. However, compared to image-language pre-training, VLP has lagged far behind due to the lack of large amounts of video-text pairs. In this work, we train a VLP model with a hybrid of image-text and video-text pairs, which significantly outperforms pre-training with only the video-text pairs. Besides, existing methods usually model the cross-modal interaction using cross-attention between single-scale visual tokens and textual tokens. These visual features are either of low resolutions lacking fine-grained information, or of high resolutions without high-level semantics. To address the issue, we propose Hierarchical interactive Video-Language Pre-training (HiVLP) that efficiently uses a hierarchical visual feature group for multi-modal cross-attention during pre-training. In the hierarchical framework, low-resolution features are learned with focus on more global high-level semantic information, while high-resolution features carry fine-grained details. As a result, HiVLP has the ability to effectively learn both the global and fine-grained representations to achieve better alignment between video and text inputs. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical multi-scale vision contrastive loss for self-supervised learning to boost the interaction between them. Experimental results show that HiVLP establishes new state-of-the-art results in three downstream tasks, text-video retrieval, video-text retrieval, and video captioning.\n[7] Title: EMMA: Efficient Visual Alignment in Multi-Modal LLMs Text: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently exhibited impressive general-purpose capabilities by leveraging vision foundation models to encode the core concepts of images into representations. These are then combined with instructions and processed by the language model to generate high-quality responses. Despite significant progress in enhancing the language component, challenges persist in optimally fusing visual encodings within the language model for task-specific adaptability. Recent research has focused on improving this fusion through modality adaptation modules but at the cost of significantly increased model complexity and training data needs. In this paper, we propose EMMA (Efficient Multi-Modal Adaptation), a lightweight cross-modality module designed to efficiently fuse visual and textual encodings, generating instruction-aware visual representations for the language model. Our key contributions include: (1) an efficient early fusion mechanism that integrates vision and language representations with minimal added parameters (less than 0.2% increase in model size), (2) an in-depth interpretability analysis that sheds light on the internal mechanisms of the proposed method; (3) comprehensive experiments that demonstrate notable improvements on both specialized and general benchmarks for MLLMs. Empirical results show that EMMA boosts performance across multiple tasks by up to 9.3% while significantly improving robustness against hallucinations. Our code is available at https://github.com/SaraGhazanfari/EMMA\n[8] Title: SimVG: A Simple Framework for Visual Grounding with Decoupled Multi-modal Fusion Text: Visual grounding is a common vision task that involves grounding descriptive sentences to the corresponding regions of an image. Most existing methods use independent image-text encoding and apply complex hand-crafted modules or encoder-decoder architectures for modal interaction and query reasoning. However, their performance significantly drops when dealing with complex textual expressions. This is because the former paradigm only utilizes limited downstream data to fit the multi-modal feature fusion. Therefore, it is only effective when the textual expressions are relatively simple. In contrast, given the wide diversity of textual expressions and the uniqueness of downstream training data, the existing fusion module, which extracts multimodal content from a visual-linguistic context, has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust transformer-based framework, SimVG, for visual grounding. Specifically, we decouple visual-linguistic feature fusion from downstream tasks by leveraging existing multimodal pre-trained models and incorporating additional object tokens to facilitate deep integration of downstream and pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we design a dynamic weight-balance distillation method in the multi-branch synchronous learning process to enhance the representation capability of the simpler branch. This branch only consists of a lightweight MLP, which simplifies the structure and improves reasoning speed. Experiments on six widely used VG datasets, i.e., RefCOCO/+/g, ReferIt, Flickr30K, and GRefCOCO, demonstrate the superiority of SimVG. Finally, the proposed method not only achieves improvements in efficiency and convergence speed but also attains new state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks.

Driven by the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), two prominent methods have emerged: (1) the hybrid integration between LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where visual inputs are firstly converted into language descriptions by VLMs, serving as inputs for LLMs to generate final answer(s); (2) visual feature alignment in language space, where visual inputs are encoded as embeddings and projected to LLMs' language space via further supervised fine-tuning. The first approach provides light training costs and interpretability but is hard to be optimized in an end-to-end fashion. The second approach presents decent performance, but feature alignment usually requires large amounts of training data and lacks interpretability. \nTo tackle this dilemma, we propose a novel approach, Inner Monologue Multi-Modal Optimization (IMMO), to solve complex vision language problems by simulating Inner Monologue, a cognitive process in which an individual engages in silent verbal communication with themselves. More specifically, we enable LLMs and VLMs to interact through natural language conversation (i.e., Inner Monologue) and propose to use a two-stage training process to learn how to do Inner Monologue (self-asking questions and answering questions). IMMO is evaluated on two popular tasks and achieves competitive performance with less training data when compared with state-of-the-art models while concurrently keeping the interpretability. The results suggest that by emulating the cognitive phenomenon of internal dialogue, our approach can enhance reasoning and explanation abilities, contributing to the more effective fusion of vision and language models. More importantly, instead of using predefined human-crafted monologues, IMMO learns this process within the deep learning models, broadening its potential applications across various AI challenges beyond vision and language tasks.\n", "keywords": " multi-modal large language models, visual-textual integration, architectural design differences, training methodologies multi-modal learning", "output": "Previous multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have employed various technical approaches to integrate visual and textual information.

Dynamic Correction Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation Text: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, but the underlying reasons remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and find that, although MLLMs incorrectly generate the objects in the final output, they are actually able to recognize visual objects in the preceding layers. We speculate that this may be due to the strong knowledge priors of the language model suppressing the visual information, leading to hallucinations. Motivated by this, we propose a novel dynamic correction decoding method for MLLMs (DeCo), which adaptively selects the appropriate preceding layers and proportionally integrates knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits. Note that DeCo is model agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated with various classic decoding strategies and applied to different MLLMs. We evaluate DeCo on widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating that it can reduce hallucination rates by a large margin compared to baselines, highlighting its potential to mitigate hallucinations.

To eliminate hallucinations, existing methods manually annotate paired responses with and without hallucinations, and then employ various alignment algorithms to improve the alignment capability between images and text. However, they not only demand considerable computation resources during the finetuning stage but also require expensive human annotation to construct paired data needed by the alignment algorithms. To address these issues, we propose an efficient fine-grained unlearning framework (EFUF), which performs gradient ascent utilizing three tailored losses to eliminate hallucinations without paired data. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently reduces hallucinations while preserving the generation quality with modest computational overhead. Our code and datasets will be publicly available.\n[2] Title: VideoHallucer: Evaluating Intrinsic and Extrinsic Hallucinations in Large Video-Language Models Text: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have extended their capabilities to video understanding. Yet, these models are often plagued by\"hallucinations\", where irrelevant or nonsensical content is generated, deviating from the actual video context. This work introduces VideoHallucer, the first comprehensive benchmark for hallucination detection in large video-language models (LVLMs). VideoHallucer categorizes hallucinations into two main types: intrinsic and extrinsic, offering further subcategories for detailed analysis, including object-relation, temporal, semantic detail, extrinsic factual, and extrinsic non-factual hallucinations. We adopt an adversarial binary VideoQA method for comprehensive evaluation, where pairs of basic and hallucinated questions are crafted strategically. By evaluating eleven LVLMs on VideoHallucer, we reveal that i) the majority of current models exhibit significant issues with hallucinations; ii) while scaling datasets and parameters improves models' ability to detect basic visual cues and counterfactuals, it provides limited benefit for detecting extrinsic factual hallucinations; iii) existing models are more adept at detecting facts than identifying hallucinations. As a byproduct, these analyses further instruct the development of our self-PEP framework, achieving an average of 5.38% improvement in hallucination resistance across all model architectures.\n[3] Title: Data-augmented phrase-level alignment for mitigating object hallucination Text: Despite their significant advancements, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often generate factually inaccurate information, referred to as hallucination. In this work, we address object hallucinations in MLLMs, where information is generated about an object not present in the input image. We introduce Data-augmented Phrase-level Alignment (DPA), a novel loss which can be applied to instruction-tuned off-the-shelf MLLMs to mitigate hallucinations, while preserving their general vision-language capabilities. To fine-tune MLLMs with DPA, we first generate a set of `hallucinated' and `correct' response pairs through generative data augmentation by selectively altering the ground-truth information of the correct responses at a phrase level. The DPA loss is then used to train MLLMs to reduce the likelihood of hallucinated phrases compared to the correct ones. Our thorough evaluation on various benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of DPA in mitigating hallucination while retaining the out-of-the-box performance of the MLLMs on general tasks. For instance, MLLMs finetuned with DPA, which we refer to as Hallucination Attenuated Language and Vision Assistant (HALVA), improve F1 by up to 13.4% on hallucination visual question-answering and reduce the hallucination rate by up to 4.2% on image description tasks.\n[4] Title: HalluciDoctor: Mitigating Hallucinatory Toxicity in Visual Instruction Data Text: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tuned on machine-generated instruction-following data have demonstrated remarkable performance in various multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. However, the hallucinations inherent in machine-generated data, which could lead to hallucinatory outputs in MLLMs, remain under-explored. This work aims to investigate various hallucinations (i.e., object, relation, attribute hallucinations) and mitigate those hallucinatory toxicities in large-scale machine-generated visual instruction datasets. Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors, we present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework, HalluciDoctor, based on the cross-checking paradigm. We use our framework to identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically. Interestingly, HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising from long-tail object cooccurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on that, we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data distribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our method successfully mitigates 44.6% hallucinations relatively and maintains competitive performance compared to LLaVA. The data and code for this paper are publicly available.11https://github.com/Yuqifan1117/HalluciDoctor\n[5] Title: SERPENT-VLM : Self-Refining Radiology Report Generation Using Vision Language Models Text: Radiology Report Generation (R2Gen) demonstrates how Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can automate the creation of accurate and coherent radiological reports. Existing methods often hallucinate details in text-based reports that don\u2019t accurately reflect the image content. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel strategy, SERPENT-VLM (SElf Refining Radiology RePort GENeraTion using Vision Language Models), which improves the R2Gen task by integrating a self-refining mechanism into the MLLM framework. We employ a unique self-supervised loss that leverages similarity between pooled image representations and the contextual representations of the generated radiological text, alongside the standard Causal Language Modeling objective, to refine image-text representations. This allows the model to scrutinize and align the generated text through dynamic interaction between a given image and the generated text, therefore reducing hallucination and continuously enhancing nuanced report generation. SERPENT-VLM outperforms existing baselines such as LlaVA-Med, BiomedGPT, etc., achieving SoTA performance on the IU X-ray and Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) datasets, and also proves to be robust against noisy images. A qualitative case study emphasizes the significant advancements towards more sophisticated MLLM frameworks for R2Gen, opening paths for further research into self-supervised refinement in the medical imaging domain.\n[6] Title: Modality-Fair Preference Optimization for Trustworthy MLLM Alignment Text: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is effective for aligning large language models (LLMs), but when applied to multimodal models (MLLMs), it often favors text over image information, leading to unreliable outputs and visual hallucinations. To address this, we propose Modality-Fair Preference Optimization (MFPO) to balance text and image preferences. First, we found that the lack of image-related rewards in preference data biases optimization toward text, so we created automated, fine-grained image preference data to correct this. Then, we designed a learning objective to ensure the model captures both text and image preferences while maintaining high-quality outputs. Finally, we use a multi-stage alignment approach to stabilize training and improve learning across both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFPO significantly enhances MLLM trustworthiness. On models like LLaVA-v1.5 (7B, 13B), our approach reduces hallucinations substantially. On the 7B model, MFPO outperforms GPT-4V and achieves a nearly 40\\% improvement over previous methods on Object HalBench, as well as achieving state-of-the-art performance on both Object HalBench and AMBER when combined with the latest LLaVA-v1.6. Code will be released.\n[7] Title: Hallu-PI: Evaluating Hallucination in Multi-modal Large Language Models within Perturbed Inputs Text: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various visual-language understanding and generation tasks. However, MLLMs occasionally generate content inconsistent with the given images, which is known as\"hallucination\". Prior works primarily center on evaluating hallucination using standard, unperturbed benchmarks, which overlook the prevalent occurrence of perturbed inputs in real-world scenarios-such as image cropping or blurring-that are critical for a comprehensive assessment of MLLMs' hallucination. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose Hallu-PI, the first benchmark designed to evaluate Hallucination in MLLMs within Perturbed Inputs. Specifically, Hallu-PI consists of seven perturbed scenarios, containing 1,260 perturbed images from 11 object types. Each image is accompanied by detailed annotations, which include fine-grained hallucination types, such as existence, attribute, and relation. We equip these annotations with a rich set of questions, making Hallu-PI suitable for both discriminative and generative tasks. Extensive experiments on 12 mainstream MLLMs, such as GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro Vision, demonstrate that these models exhibit significant hallucinations on Hallu-PI, which is not observed in unperturbed scenarios. Furthermore, our research reveals a severe bias in MLLMs' ability to handle different types of hallucinations. We also design two baselines specifically for perturbed scenarios, namely Perturbed-Reminder and Perturbed-ICL. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to the limitations of MLLMs when dealing with perturbed inputs, and spur further investigations to address this issue. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/Hallu-PI.\n[8] Title: Reefknot: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Relation Hallucination Evaluation, Analysis and Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models Text: Hallucination issues continue to affect multimodal large language models (MLLMs), with existing research mainly addressing object-level or attribute-level hallucinations, neglecting the more complex relation hallucinations that require advanced reasoning. Current benchmarks for relation hallucinations lack detailed evaluation and effective mitigation, and their datasets often suffer from biases due to systematic annotation processes. To address these challenges, we introduce Reefknot, a comprehensive benchmark targeting relation hallucinations, comprising over 20,000 real-world samples. We provide a systematic definition of relation hallucinations, integrating perceptive and cognitive perspectives, and construct a relation-based corpus using the Visual Genome scene graph dataset. Our comparative evaluation reveals significant limitations in current MLLMs' ability to handle relation hallucinations. Additionally, we propose a novel confidence-based mitigation strategy, which reduces the hallucination rate by an average of 9.75% across three datasets, including Reefknot. Our work offers valuable insights for achieving trustworthy multimodal intelligence.\n[9] Title: Leveraging Hallucinations to Reduce Manual Prompt Dependency in Promptable Segmentation Text: Promptable segmentation typically requires instance-specific manual prompts to guide the segmentation of each desired object. To minimize such a need, task-generic promptable segmentation has been introduced, which employs a single task-generic prompt to segment various images of different objects in the same task. Current methods use Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to reason detailed instance-specific prompts from a task-generic prompt for improving segmentation accuracy. The effectiveness of this segmentation heavily depends on the precision of these derived prompts. However, MLLMs often suffer hallucinations during reasoning, resulting in inaccurate prompting. While existing methods focus on eliminating hallucinations to improve a model, we argue that MLLM hallucinations can reveal valuable contextual insights when leveraged correctly, as they represent pre-trained large-scale knowledge beyond individual images. In this paper, we utilize hallucinations to mine task-related information from images and verify its accuracy for enhancing precision of the generated prompts. Specifically, we introduce an iterative Prompt-Mask Cycle generation framework (ProMaC) with a prompt generator and a mask generator.The prompt generator uses a multi-scale chain of thought prompting, initially exploring hallucinations for extracting extended contextual knowledge on a test image.These hallucinations are then reduced to formulate precise instance-specific prompts, directing the mask generator to produce masks that are consistent with task semantics by mask semantic alignment. The generated masks iteratively induce the prompt generator to focus more on task-relevant image areas and reduce irrelevant hallucinations, resulting jointly in better prompts and masks. Experiments on 5 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ProMaC.

However, there are still challenges and limitations, including the need for comprehensive benchmarks, effective and efficient methods, and addressing the limitations of MLLMs when dealing with perturbed inputs.", "total_cost": 0}, {"final_passages": "[0] Title: Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-Training Text: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been a celebrated method for training vision encoders to generate image/text representations facilitating various applications. Recently, CLIP has been widely adopted as the vision backbone of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to connect image inputs for language interactions. The success of CLIP as a vision-language foundation model relies on aligning web-crawled noisy text annotations at image levels. Nevertheless, such criteria may become insufficient for downstream tasks in need of fine-grained vision representations, especially when region-level understanding is demanding for MLLMs. In this paper, we improve the localization capability of CLIP with several advances. We propose a pre-training method called Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-training (CLOC) by complementing CLIP with region-text contrastive loss and modules. We formulate a new concept, promptable embeddings, of which the encoder produces image embeddings easy to transform into region representations given spatial hints. To support large-scale pre-training, we design a visually-enriched and spatially-localized captioning framework to effectively generate region-text pseudo-labels at scale. By scaling up to billions of annotated images, CLOC enables high-quality regional embeddings for image region recognition and retrieval tasks, and can be a drop-in replacement of CLIP to enhance MLLMs, especially on referring and grounding tasks.\n[1] Title: Bootstrap Fine-Grained Vision-Language Alignment for Unified Zero-Shot Anomaly Localization Text: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have shown promising performance on zero-shot visual recognition tasks by learning visual representations under natural language supervision. Recent studies attempt the use of CLIP to tackle zero-shot anomaly detection by matching images with normal and abnormal state prompts. However, since CLIP focuses on building correspondence between paired text prompts and global image-level representations, the lack of fine-grained patch-level vision to text alignment limits its capability on precise visual anomaly localization. In this work, we propose AnoCLIP for zero-shot anomaly localization. In the visual encoder, we introduce a training-free value-wise attention mechanism to extract intrinsic local tokens of CLIP for patch-level local description. From the perspective of text supervision, we particularly design a unified domain-aware contrastive state prompting template for fine-grained vision-language matching. On top of the proposed AnoCLIP, we further introduce a test-time adaptation (TTA) mechanism to refine visual anomaly localization results, where we optimize a lightweight adapter in the visual encoder using AnoCLIP's pseudo-labels and noise-corrupted tokens. With both AnoCLIP and TTA, we significantly exploit the potential of CLIP for zero-shot anomaly localization and demonstrate the effectiveness of AnoCLIP on various datasets.\n[2] Title: From CLIP to DINO: Visual Encoders Shout in Multi-modal Large Language Models Text: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in expanding the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the incorporation of visual perception interfaces. Despite the emergence of exciting applications and the availability of diverse instruction tuning data, existing approaches often rely on CLIP or its variants as the visual branch, and merely extract features from the deep layers. However, these methods lack a comprehensive analysis of the visual encoders in MLLMs. In this paper, we conduct an extensive investigation into the effectiveness of different vision encoders within MLLMs. Our findings reveal that the shallow layer features of CLIP offer particular advantages for fine-grained tasks such as grounding and region understanding. Surprisingly, the vision-only model DINO, which is not pretrained with text-image alignment, demonstrates promising performance as a visual branch within MLLMs. By simply equipping it with an MLP layer for alignment, DINO surpasses CLIP in fine-grained related perception tasks. Building upon these observations, we propose a simple yet effective feature merging strategy, named COMM, that integrates CLIP and DINO with Multi-level features Merging, to enhance the visual capabilities of MLLMs. We evaluate COMM through comprehensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including image captioning, visual question answering, visual grounding, and object hallucination. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of COMM compared to existing methods, showcasing its enhanced visual capabilities within MLLMs.\n[3] Title: RAR: Retrieving And Ranking Augmented MLLMs for Visual Recognition Text: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) uses contrastive learning from noise image-text pairs to excel at recognizing a wide array of candidates, yet its focus on broad associations hinders the precision in distinguishing subtle differences among fine-grained items. Conversely, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at classifying fine-grained categories, thanks to their substantial knowledge from pre-training on web-level corpora. However, the performance of MLLMs declines with an increase in category numbers, primarily due to growing complexity and constraints of limited context window size. To synergize the strengths of both approaches and enhance the few-shot/zero-shot recognition abilities for datasets characterized by extensive and fine-grained vocabularies, this paper introduces RAR, a Retrieving And Ranking augmented method for MLLMs. We initially establish a multi-modal retriever based on CLIP to create and store explicit memory for different categories beyond the immediate context window. During inference, RAR retrieves the top-k similar results from the memory and uses MLLMs to rank and make the final predictions. Our proposed approach not only addresses the inherent limitations in fine-grained recognition but also preserves the model's comprehensive knowledge base, significantly boosting accuracy across a range of vision-language recognition tasks. Notably, our approach demonstrates a significant improvement in performance on 5 fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks, 11 few-shot image recognition datasets, and the 2 object detection datasets under the zero-shot recognition setting.\n[4] Title: DetailCLIP: Detail-Oriented CLIP for Fine-Grained Tasks Text: In this paper, we introduce DetailCLIP: A Detail-Oriented CLIP to address the limitations of contrastive learning-based vision-language models, particularly CLIP, in handling detail-oriented and fine-grained tasks like segmentation. While CLIP and its variants excel in the global alignment of image and text representations, they often struggle to capture the fine-grained details necessary for precise segmentation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that employs patch-level comparison of self-distillation and pixel-level reconstruction losses, enhanced with an attention-based token removal mechanism. This approach selectively retains semantically relevant tokens, enabling the model to focus on the image's critical regions aligned with the specific functions of our model, including textual information processing, patch comparison, and image reconstruction, ensuring that the model learns high-level semantics and detailed visual features. Our experiments demonstrate that DetailCLIP surpasses existing CLIP-based and traditional self-supervised learning (SSL) models in segmentation accuracy and exhibits superior generalization across diverse datasets. DetailCLIP represents a significant advancement in vision-language modeling, offering a robust solution for tasks that demand high-level semantic understanding and detailed feature extraction. https://github.com/KishoreP1/DetailCLIP.\n[5] Title: CLIP-ReID: Exploiting Vision-Language Model for Image Re-Identification without Concrete Text Labels Text: Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have recently shown superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification and segmentation. However, in fine-grained image re-identification (ReID), the labels are indexes, lacking concrete text descriptions. Therefore, it remains to be determined how such models could be applied to these tasks. This paper first finds out that simply fine-tuning the visual model initialized by the image encoder in CLIP, has already obtained competitive performances in various ReID tasks. Then we propose a two-stage strategy to facilitate a better visual representation. The key idea is to fully exploit the cross-modal description ability in CLIP through a set of learnable text tokens for each ID and give them to the text encoder to form ambiguous descriptions. In the first training stage, image and text encoders from CLIP keep fixed, and only the text tokens are optimized from scratch by the contrastive loss computed within a batch. In the second stage, the ID-specific text tokens and their encoder become static, providing constraints for fine-tuning the image encoder. With the help of the designed loss in the downstream task, the image encoder is able to represent data as vectors in the feature embedding accurately. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated on several datasets for the person or vehicle ReID tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Syliz517/CLIP-ReID.\n[6] Title: RegionCLIP: Region-based Language-Image Pretraining Text: Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) using image-text pairs has achieved impressive results on image classification in both zero-shot and transfer learning set-tings. However, we show that directly applying such mod-els to recognize image regions for object detection leads to unsatisfactory performance due to a major domain shift: CLIP was trained to match an image as a whole to a text de-scription, without capturing the fine-grained alignment be-tween image regions and text spans. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new method called RegionCLIP that signifi-cantly extends CLIP to learn region-level visual representations, thus enabling fine-grained alignment between image regions and textual concepts. Our method leverages a CLIP model to match image regions with template captions, and then pretrains our model to align these region-text pairs in the feature space. When transferring our pretrained model to the open-vocabulary object detection task, our method outperforms the state of the art by 3.8 AP50 and 2.2 AP for novel categories on COCO and LVIS datasets, respectively. Further, the learned region representations support zero-shot inference for object detection, showing promising results on both COCO and LVIS datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/RegionCLIP.\n[7] Title: LightCLIP: Learning Multi-Level Interaction for Lightweight Vision-Language Models Text: Vision-language pre-training like CLIP has shown promising performance on various downstream tasks such as zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval. Most of the existing CLIP-alike works usually adopt relatively large image encoders like ResNet50 and ViT, while the lightweight counterparts are rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a multi-level interaction paradigm for training lightweight CLIP models. Firstly, to mitigate the problem that some image-text pairs are not strictly one-to-one correspondence, we improve the conventional global instance-level alignment objective by softening the label of negative samples progressively. Secondly, a relaxed bipartite matching based token-level alignment objective is introduced for finer-grained alignment between image patches and textual words. Moreover, based on the observation that the accuracy of CLIP model does not increase correspondingly as the parameters of text encoder increase, an extra objective of masked language modeling (MLM) is leveraged for maximizing the potential of the shortened text encoder. In practice, an auxiliary fusion module injecting unmasked image embedding into masked text embedding at different network stages is proposed for enhancing the MLM. Extensive experiments show that without introducing additional computational cost during inference, the proposed method achieves a higher performance on multiple downstream tasks.\n[8] Title: Contrasting Intra-Modal and Ranking Cross-Modal Hard Negatives to Enhance Visio-Linguistic Fine-grained Understanding Text: Current Vision and Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong performance across various vision-language tasks, yet they struggle with \ufb01ne-grained understanding. This issue stems from weak image-caption alignment in pretraining datasets and a simpli\ufb01ed contrastive objective that fails to distinguish nuanced grounding elements such as relations, actions, and attributes. As a result, the models tend to learn bag-of-words representations. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce an intra-modal contrastive loss and a unique cross-modal rank loss with an adaptive threshold that serves as curriculum learning, utilizing our automatically generated hard negatives to augment the model\u2019s capacity. Our strategy, which does not necessitate additional annotations or parameters, can be incorporated into any VLM trained with an image-text contrastive loss. Upon application to CLIP, our method leads to signi\ufb01cant improvements on three \ufb01ne-grained benchmarks, and it also enhances the performance of X-VLM, which is the state-of-art moodel on \ufb01ne-grained reasoning. 1\n[9] Title: Machine Vision Therapy: Multimodal Large Language Models Can Enhance Visual Robustness via Denoising In-Context Learning Text: Although vision models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) show impressive generalization performance, their zero-shot robustness is still limited under Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios without fine-tuning. Instead of undesirably providing human supervision as commonly done, it is possible to take advantage of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that hold powerful visual understanding abilities. However, MLLMs are shown to struggle with vision problems due to the incompatibility of tasks, thus hindering their utilization. In this paper, we propose to effectively leverage MLLMs to conduct Machine Vision Therapy which aims to rectify the noisy predictions from vision models. By fine-tuning with the denoised labels, the learning model performance can be boosted in an unsupervised manner. To solve the incompatibility issue, we propose a novel Denoising In-Context Learning (DICL) strategy to align vision tasks with MLLMs. Concretely, by estimating a transition matrix that captures the probability of one class being confused with another, an instruction containing a correct exemplar and an erroneous one from the most probable noisy class can be constructed. Such an instruction can help any MLLMs with ICL ability to detect and rectify incorrect predictions of vision models. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet, WILDS, DomainBed, and other OOD datasets, we carefully validate the quantitative and qualitative effectiveness of our method.

Through instruction tuning~\\cite{wei2021finetuned,wang2022self}, existing LLMs demonstrate their versatility as general-purpose models capable of handling a wide range of tasks. This capability unlocks their potential zero-shot learning ability, enabling seamless task switching guided by instructions. Building upon the promising performance of LLMs, researchers are now motivated to enhance their capabilities by incorporating visual signals as inputs. This extension allows the generation of textual outputs that are closely related to visual content, opening up exciting possibilities in the realm of vision-language understanding.\n\nTo this end, Flamingo~\\cite{alayrac2022flamingo} and BLIP2~\\cite{li2023blip2} align the powerful LLMs with a frozen visual encoder to understand visual inputs and perform various vision-language tasks. A series of following works, LLaVA~\\cite{liu2023llava}, InstructBLIP~\\cite{dai2023instructblip}, MiniGPT-4~\\cite{zhu2023minigpt} and mPLUG-OWL~\\cite{ye2023mplug} further improve the ability to follow human instructions by constructing multi-modal instruction-following datasets for training. However, these methods are built on image-level alignments, which suffer from the limited fine-grained understanding (such as region description~\\cite{liu2017referring} and reasoning~\\cite{zellers2019recognition}) and severe object hallucination problem~\\cite{li2023obj_Hallucination}. To this end, GPT4ROI~\\cite{zhang2023gpt4roi} proposes instruction tuning on region-of-interest and unlocks the region-level multimodal capacities. Kosmos-2~\\cite{peng2023kosmos} and Shikra~\\cite{chen2023shikra} further integrate the grounding abilities into LLMs and unlock the referential ability in dialogue, \\emph{i.e.}, enable the user to point to the object or region as input and the model responds with spatial coordinates of bounding boxes. Such grounding capacity can fulfill numerous vision-language tasks, which is a great progress in MLLMs.  \n\nDespite a wide variety of exciting methods and applications, most of existing multi-modal LLMs employ CLIP~\\cite{radford2021learning} or its variants ~\\cite{sun2023eva} as the visual branch, where the features output from the deep layers (\\emph{e.g.}, the penultimate layer) are usually employed as inputs to the language decoders. However, it still lacks analysis that: \\emph{Whether using the Vanilla CLIP features as visual encoder is the best way for MLLMs?} Though the visual encoder of CLIP is apparently well aligned with the word embedding space by image-text contrastive learning, it fails to learn more detailed pixel-level information such as color and positioning due to the global supervision of image captions, which might hinder the fine-grained perception ability in MLLMs. Besides, existing MLLMs have quite unbalanced visual and language encoders (\\emph{e.g.}, ViT-Large-300M vs. Vicuna-7B/13B). Since the language models have succeeded in scaling up the model size with progressively powerful language abilities, the short plate of the Buckets Effect for MLLMs lies in the visual models, which fails to demonstrate emerging capabilities, and suffer from domain gap and limited zero-shot ability. Consequently, it is critical to enhance the visual capabilities for boosting MLLMs. \n\nThis paper presents an extensive investigation into different visual encoders for MLLMs. Four typical visual foundation models are considered, \\emph{i.e.}, image-text contrastive learning CLIP, image-only contrastive learning DINOv2~\\cite{oquab2023dinov2}, masked image modeling MAE~\\cite{he2022masked} and supervised learning DeiT~\\cite{touvron2021training}. We evaluate the performance on commonly-used vision-language tasks including visual grounding, object hallucination, visual question answering, image captioning and MME benchmark. \nOur analysis reveals that different layers of features exhibit varying biases towards local and global patterns. Shallow layer features containing low-level detailed information prove beneficial for fine-grained perception tasks such as grounding and positioning ability, while deep layer features are superior at global understanding. To enhance representation, we propose a multi-level feature merging strategy that incorporates both low-level and high-level features. Surprisingly, when equipped with an MLP layer for alignment, the vision-only model DINOv2 shows promise as a visual branch for MLLMs. We attribute this to the fine-grained localization information captured by DINOv2. Conversely, MAE and DeiT perform inferiorly as visual branches for MLLMs. MAE learns limited semantic information, while DeiT's strong supervised training makes the alignment with the textual space challenging. Based on the above observations, we propose a fusion strategy that integrates \\textbf{C}LIP and DIN\\textbf{O} with \\textbf{M}ulti-level features \\textbf{M}erging), dubbed as \\textbf{COMM}, for boosting the visual branches of MLLMs.\nExperimental results demonstrate clear advantages of the proposed model over existing approaches and highlight the enhanced visual capabilities brought by \\textbf{COMM}. In a nutshell, the contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\\begin{itemize}\n    \\item We are the first to extensively investigate the effectiveness of different visual encoders for MLLMs. Based on the analysis that shallow layer features contain low-level detailed information which is helpful for fine-grained tasks, we propose a multi-level feature fusion strategy to incorporate low-level and high-level features for improving representation.\n    \\item Our analysis indicates that vision-only DINOv2 achieves promising results in MLLMs with only an MLP layer for alignment.

The success of LLMs has motivated researchers to explore the integration of vision into these models, leading to the development of powerful multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs). Flamingo~\\cite{alayrac2022flamingo} employs a cross-attention module to extract visual contexts, which are concatenated with text token as input for LLMs. LLaVA~\\cite{liu2023visual} and FROMAGe~\\cite{koh2023grounding} leverage the vision encoder of CLIP to extract visual features, which is aligned to text features using a single linear layer and then input to LLMs. Models such as BLIP-2~\\cite{li2023blip}, mPLUG-OWL~\\cite{ye2023mplug}, MiniGPT-4~\\cite{zhu2023minigpt} and InstructBLIP~\\cite{dai2023instructblip} employ Q-former to extract text-aligned visual features for LLMs. Recently, some interesting works extend LLMs to image retrieval~\\cite{koh2023grounding}, video understanding~\\cite{zhang2023video}, audio~\\cite{su2023pandagpt}, biomedical analysis~\\cite{li2023llava}, control systems~\\cite{driess2023palme}. \n\nIn recent studies, there has been a growing interest in extending MLLMs to improve their fine-grained understanding abilities through region-level image-text alignment. Kosmos-2~\\cite{peng2023kosmos} addresses this by constructing a large-scale dataset of grounded region-text pairs, enabling the integration of grounding abilities into LLMs. GPT4RoI~\\cite{zhang2023gpt4roi} reformulates the bounding box as a spatial instruction format and extracts visual features based on region-of-interest, facilitating region-level multi-modal understanding. Shikra~\\cite{chen2023shikra} proposes a unified model that handles spatial coordinates to possess referential abilities in dialogue contexts. Ferret~\\cite{you2023ferret} and ViP-LLaVA~\\cite{cai2023making} further extends with a broader range of free-form shapes for referring, including points, boxes, sketches and scribbles.\nAdditionally, Qwen~\\cite{Qwen-VL} presents a set of MLLMs that demonstrate remarkable performance across various tasks. However, previous works have predominantly focused on extracting visual features solely from the last few layers of the CLIP model, resulting in an emphasis on global image properties. In this study, we draw attention to the fact that features extracted from shallower layers exhibit a stronger focus on localized properties, which we argue can be more potent in comprehending object locations and image details. Additionally, while CLIP primarily learns globally aligned features, advanced vision-alone models such as DINOv2 excel in capturing more fine-grained vision features. We posit that leveraging these fine-grained vision features can effectively enhance the capabilities of MLLMs, as demonstrated in our analysis. To further advance this line of research, we introduce a novel fusion module that expands and enhances the visual branches, thereby aiming to significantly improve the performance of MLLMs.\n\n\\textbf{Large Vision Foundation Model.} Recent progresses in training vision foundation models with large-scale image data focus on contrastive learning, masked image modeling and supervised training. For one thing, contrastive learning can be conducted in an image-only or image-text manner. DINOv2~\\cite{oquab2023dinov2} pretrains the image encoder on large curated image data, which shows a superior understanding of object parts and scene geometry across image domains. Image-text contrastive learning as CLIP~\\cite{radford2021learning} and EVA-CLIP~\\cite{sun2023eva} employs the natural language as weak supervision to guide the learning of visual features. \nFor another, BEiT~\\cite{HangboBao2021BEiT} predicts discrete tokens based on a pre-trained image tokenizer while iBOT~\\cite{zhou2021ibot} proposes an online image tokenizer. MAE~\\cite{he2022masked} proposes a masked autoencoder for reconstructing image pixels. Besides, DeiT III~\\cite{Touvron2022DeiTIR} proposes a training recipe to achieve promising performance.\nRecent MLLMs employ the vision encoder of CLIP/EVA-CLIP without considering the properties of specific visual models. \nIn this paper, we are the first to re-examine the effectiveness of existing visual models in MLLMs and propose a simple yet effective fusion strategy for boosting visual capabilities.\n\n\n\\section{Analysis of the Visual Branch in MLLMs}\n\nPrevious MLLMs~\\cite{liu2023llava,liu2023improvedllava,zhu2023minigpt,dai2023instructblip,ye2023mplug,peng2023kosmos,chen2023shikra,Qwen-VL,you2023ferret} usually utilize the vision encoder of CLIP as their visual branch. Typically, these models extract features from the last few layers, such as the penultimate layer, which are then fed into an alignment network. Subsequently, the aligned features are concatenated with text tokens to serve as input for the LLMs. While the image-text pretraining of CLIP aligns well with the language model, it primarily learns image-level features but overlooks the richer pixel-level features due to the constraint of limited fine-grained information in the guided captions. Moreover, the deep-layer features primarily focus on global image properties and inadequately explore the intricate details of local object parts. As depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:feature}, the visual features extracted from the shallow layers of CLIP and the deep visual features obtained from the visual-only model DINOv2 contain more detailed information regarding local objects, such as shape or texture. Leveraging these detailed features may enhance the MLLMs' fine-grained perception abilities. \n\n\\textbf{Evaluation Settings.} For further analysis, we conduct a series of quantitative experiments using different kinds of visual models, \\emph{i.e.}, image-text contrastive learning CLIP, image-only contrastive learning DINOv2, masked image modeling MAE and supervised learning DeiT. In specific, the visual features extracted from different layers of visual models (based on ViT-Large) are aligned using a linear projection layer and then concatenated with text tokens as the input for LLMs (here we use Vicuna-7B~\\cite{chiangvicuna}). The overall architecture and training process follow Shikra~\\cite{chen2023shikra} but with fewer iterations (9400 iterations, batch size 16 on 4 A800) to save the computation cost. Then, we measure the capability of the trained MLLMs on referring expression comprehension (REC)~\\cite{chen2023shikra}, referring expression generation (REG)~\\cite{peng2023kosmos} and object hallucination benchmark (POPE)~\\cite{li2023obj_Hallucination}. \nDetailed descriptions of these tasks can be referred to Sec.~\\ref{sec:experiments}.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\renewcommand{\\baselinestretch}{1.0}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\textwidth]{feature.png}\n\\caption{Feature correspondence visualization by computing the cosine similarity of different visual tokens extracted from the shallow and deep layers of CLIP and DINOv2. }\\label{fig:feature}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\textbf{CLIP as the Visual Branch of MLLMs.} As depicted in Fig.~\\ref{fig:rec}, we observe that different layers of features exhibit varying biases towards grounding and understanding abilities. For instance, the shallow features demonstrate relatively higher accuracy in terms of REC and reach their optimal value at layer 12. Conversely, the deep features achieve higher accuracy in terms of POPE, indicating superior understanding ability. Notably, the relatively deep features (layer 16) display the best REG CIDEr score, showcasing promising region understanding capabilities. Consequently, instead of solely relying on deep features as done in previous works, we argue that integrating both shallow and deep features is crucial for MLLMs with improved overall performance.\n\nWe further explore various merging modes of low-level and high-level features. Denoting the output features from each transformer layer of ViT with a depth of $N$ as $\\mathbf{z}=[ z_1,..,z_i,...,z_N ]$, we discuss several multi-level feature merging (MFM) strategies for combining shallow and deep features, namely: \n\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{Mean(half)}: averaging output patch token features in the second half of the backbone as $z=(z_{N/2}+\\cdots+z_{N})/(N/2)$. \n\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{Mean(all)}: averaging features output by all layers as $z=(z_{1}+\\cdots+z_{N})/N$. \n\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{Layerscale(all)}: learning a scale parameter as the weight to sum features output by all layers as $z=w_1z_{1}+\\cdots+w_Nz_{N}$, where $w_i$ refers to the weight assigned to the $i$-th layer feature and all these weights are dynamically updated and summed up to 1. \n\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{LLN-Layerscale(all)}: using a linear-layernorm module to align the feature space between different layers\u2019 features and then summed by \\emph{Layerscale} as $z=w_1\\mathrm{LLN}(z_{1})+\\cdots+w_N\\mathrm{LLN}(z_{N})$.\n\n$\\bullet$ \\emph{Conv-Layerscale(all)}: using a convolution and bn module to align the feature space between different layers\u2019 features and then summed by \\emph{Layerscale} as $z=w_1\\mathrm{Conv}(z_{1})+\\cdots+w_N\\mathrm{Conv}(z_{N})$. \n\nFig.~\\ref{fig:clipanddino} (a) and (b) shows that simply averaging all shallow and deep features of CLIP can \\emph{de facto} achieve a satisfactory accuracy and \\emph{LLN-Layerscale} strategy further improves performance. With \\emph{LLN-Layerscale} as MFM module, the performance of CLIP can be evidently improved on commonly-used vision-language tasks as shown in Table~\\ref{tab:fusion}. \n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\renewcommand{\\baselinestretch}{1.0}\n\\centering\n \\subfloat[Average REC accuracy.]{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.33\\columnwidth]{analysis_rec2.png}}\n\\subfloat[Average POPE accuracy.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.33\\columnwidth]{analysis_pope2.png}}\n\\subfloat[Average REG CIDEr.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.33\\columnwidth]{analysis_reg2.png}}\n\\caption{Average REC, POPE accuracy and REG CIDEr for using different layers of features extracted from various vision models (CLIP, DINOv2 and MAE), as input to MLLMs. Shikra uses the 23rd layer features of CLIP and we reproduce its results with fewer iterations (denoted as Shikra$^*$).}\n\\label{fig:rec}\n\\end{figure}\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\renewcommand{\\baselinestretch}{1.0}\n\\centering\n \\subfloat[ REC acc for CLIP.]{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.26\\columnwidth]{recclip.png}}\n\\subfloat[ POPE acc for CLIP.]{\n\\includegraphics[width=0.248\\columnwidth]{popeclip.png}}\n\\subfloat[REC acc for DINO.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.247\\columnwidth,height=0.222\\columnwidth]{recdino.png}}\n\\subfloat[POPE acc for DINO.]{\\includegraphics[width=0.248\\columnwidth,height=0.222\\columnwidth]{popedino.png}}\n\\caption{Average REC and POPE accuracy for merging different layers of features with mutli-feature merging (MFM) strategies as input to MLLMs for visual backbones of CLIP and DINOv2. }\n\\label{fig:clipanddino}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\\textbf{DINOv2 as the Visual Branch of MLLMs.} \nTo leverage the rich fine-grained visual information present in DINOv2, but not inherently aligned with text, we employ a non-linear Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) module to align the image features with the word embedding space. Fig.~\\ref{fig:rec}  demonstrates that the deep-layer features of DINOv2 exhibit superior grounding abilities, as evidenced by higher REC accuracy, and display satisfactory understanding abilities, as indicated by favorable POPE and REG results. Additionally, we explore the efficacy of multi-level feature merging to enhance performance. In contrast to CLIP, the merging of shallow features from DINOv2 leads to a significant performance degradation. Specifically, in Fig.~\\ref{fig:clipanddino}(c) and (d), it is evident that \\emph{Mean(all)} performs notably worse than \\emph{Mean(19-24)} in terms of both REC and POPE accuracy, indicating that the shallow representations lack sufficient semantic information. Building upon the \\emph{LLN-Layerscale} approach, the incorporation of the MLP module for a more potent connection between the visual and text spaces demonstrates a clear improvement in performance. Table~\\ref{tab:fusion} showcases the substantial performance gains achieved by employing \\emph{LLN-Layerscale-MLP} as Multi-Level Feature Merging (MFM) module across various vision language tasks. Further detailed ablation studies on the MLP module are in Section~\\ref{sec:mae}. \n\\begin{table}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{2.8pt}\n\\caption{Comparison of the visual model using CLIP, DINOv2 with Multi-level Feature Merging (MFM) and \\textbf{COMM} to incorporate visual embeddings of both models on VL tasks.

This is because MAE features lack sufficient semantic information for global or regional understanding. Therefore, MAE is not suitable as the visual branch for MLLMs. DeiT performs even worse than MAE (details in Section~\\ref{sec:mae}). We speculate that this is because supervised training is too strong, which learns a specialized visual space that is difficult to align with the word embedding space.\n\\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\renewcommand{\\baselinestretch}{1.0}\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=1\\columnwidth]{overall2.pdf}\n\\caption{Overview of our \\textbf{COMM}.

Then the fused features are concatenated with text tokens as input to LLMs.}\n\\label{fig:overall}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\n\n\\section{\\textbf{COMM}\n\n\\textbf{Architecture Overview.} In this section, we introduce the proposed \\textbf{COMM}, that integrates CLIP and DINO with Multi-level features Merging to enhance the visual capabilities of MLLMs. The overall framework is illustrated in Fig.~\\ref{fig:overall}, \\textbf{COMM} is incorporated into a vision-language instruction following model built upon the\nrecent advanced language and vision-language foundation models. Following the input instructions, our model takes vision and language as inputs to generate text responses following the input instructions.\nSpecifically, we adopt the visual encoder of CLIP and DINOv2 (based on ViT-Large) with our proposed fusion strategy as the visual branch, and Vicuna~\\cite{chiangvicuna} (7B/13B) as language decoder. The visual encoder is downsampled with rate 14, meaning that an image with resolution $H\\times W$ will be represented by a sequence of $\\frac{H}{14}\\times \\frac{W}{14}$ tokens.\nThe fused token features are projected using a linear layer and then concatenated with the instruction tokens as inputs to the language decoder, which is a generic interface to unify various vision-language tasks as text generation task.\n\nSpecifically, denote the visual encoder of CLIP and DINOv2 (ViT Large used) as $f_1$ and $f_2$, respectively. Given an input image $x$, we extract the patch token features output by all layers of CLIP as $f_1(x)=[v_1^{1},...,v_1^{i},...,v_1^{24}]$, where $v_1^i \\in \\mathbf{R}^{N\\times D}$, $N$ is the number of patch tokens and $D$ is the embedding dimension. The features output by the deep layers of DINOv2 are $f_2(x)=[v_2^{19},...,v_2^{i},...,v_2^{24}]$. Then we concatenate the features output by these two models as $\\mathbf{v}=[v_1^{1},...,v_1^{24},v_2^{19},...,v_2^{24}]$. A linear-layernorm module is employed to align the feature space between different layers\u2019 features and layerscale is used to merge multiple layer features as\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\overline{v}_1 = \\sum_{i=1}^{24} \\alpha_i \\cdot \\mathrm{Linear}(\\mathrm{LN}(v_1^{i})), \\qquad \\overline{v}_2 = \\sum_{j=19}^{24} \\beta_j \\cdot \\mathrm{Linear}(\\mathrm{LN}(v_2^{j}))\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are the learnable scaling parameter. Then, we employ an MLP layer to project the features of DINOv2 and concatenate the output features with that of CLIP as $\\mathbf{\\overline{v}}=[\\overline{v}_1,\\mathrm{MLP}(\\overline{v}_2)]$. Then, a linear layer is employed to match the dimension of visual features to that of text features as $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}=\\mathrm{Linear}(\\mathbf{\\overline{v}})$. Finally, fused visual features $\\mathbf{\\hat{v}}$ are concatenated with text tokens as input to LLMs.\n\n\n\\section{Experiments}\n\n\\label{sec:experiments}\nIn this section, we conduct extensive evaluation on four kinds of vision-language tasks to comprehensively evaluate the visual understanding ability of our model, namely, Referring Expression Comprehension, Referring Expression Generation, Object Hallucination Benchmark, and Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning.\n\n\\textbf{Training Details.} Similar to previous MLLM methods, \\textbf{COMM} is trained in two stages. In the first pretraining stage, we train the model on the reorganized vision-language dataset as~\\cite{chen2023shikra}, including public VQA, Image Captioning datset and several datasets containing positional annotation RefCOCO, visual gemone~\\cite{krishna2017visualgenome} and Visual-7W~\\cite{mani2020pointqa}. The first pretraining stage is conducted for 100K steps. In the second instruction tuning stage, we set the sampling ratio to 50\\% on LLaVA-Instruct-150K~\\cite{liu2023llava} and Shikra-RD~\\cite{chen2023shikra}. Instead of 224 \u00d7 224 resolution currently used by existing MLLMs, we use 336 \u00d7 336 resolution to reduce the information loss caused by image down-sampling and promote the fine-grained perception ability. In both stages, we freeze the visual encoder and tune all parameters in LLMs, alignment layer and multi-level feature fusion module. We adopt AdamW~\\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/LoshchilovH19adamw} as the optimizer and cosine annealing\nscheduler~\\cite{DBLP:conf/iclr/LoshchilovH17cos} as learning rate scheduler with an initial learning rate of\n2e-5 and global batch size of 64. All training runs on 8 NVIDIA A800 GPUs. It takes around 100h for stage one training and 20h for stage two.\n\n\\begin{table*}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\caption{Results on standard referring expression comprehension (REC) task.

As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:rec}, compared with generalist VL models and previous SOTA MLLMs, \\textbf{COMM} achieves significant performance gain on all benchmarks, \\emph{i.e.}, \\textbf{COMM}-7B outperforms Shikra-13B and Qwen-VL-7B-Chat by 4.87\\% and 3.10\\% accuracy on average, respectively. With more powerful visual capabilities of our proposed fusion model, we can evidently surpass recent SOTA MLLMs in a more efficient way, \\emph{e.g.}, using a smaller LLM than Shikra (7B vs. 13B) and less training data than Qwen (3.6M vs. 1.4B). Besides, our generalist model even achieves comparable results with specialist SOTA methods, showing the superior grounding ability of our MLLMs.\n\n\\subsection{Referring Expression Generation}\nMoreover, we evaluate the ability to understand image regions or objects referred via inputting bounding boxes. Instead of referring image regions or objects via detailed text descriptions, directly referring to image regions via its bounding boxes is more effective and can reduce the ambiguity.\nThe experiments are conducted on the referring expression generation task with RefCOCO, RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg, aiming to generate text descriptions of specific regions in the bounding box. Table~\\ref{tab:reg} shows that our model outperforms Shikra and Kosmos-2 by a considerable margin of 16.51 CIDEr and 16.92 CIDEr gain on RefCOCOg, demonstrating the effectiveness of our model for fine-grained understanding.

Table~\\ref{tab:pope_results} shows that \\textbf{COMM} surpasses recent popular MLLMs with 1.44\\% and 4.95\\% higher accuracy on average than Shikra and InstrutBLIP, respectively. By enhancing the fine-grained visual capabilities, \\textbf{COMM} can effectively alleviate the object hallucination problem.\n\n\\subsection{Visual Question Answering and Image Captioning}\nWe evaluate \\textbf{COMM} on conventional VL tasks of VQA and Image Captioning. Specifically, image captioning requires the model to generate description for the given image and VQA asks the model to generate answer for the given image-question pair. For image captioning, we choose COCO~\\cite{chen2015cococap} and Flickr30K~\\cite{plummer2015flickr30ke} as benchmarks and report the CIDEr score. For VQA task, we experiment on VQAv2~\\cite{antol2015vqav2} and OK-VQA~\\cite{marino2019ok}. \nAs shown in Table~\\ref{tab:vl}, \\textbf{COMM} achieves state-of-the-art performance on image captioning task, \\emph{i.e.}, 88.2 CIDEr score on Flickr30K and 132.7 CIDEr score on COCO, even outperforms previous SOTA models with much more parameters (\\emph{e.g.}, Shikra-13B with 13B parameters) or much more training data (\\emph{e.g.}, Qwen with 1.4B data). For VQA task, our model also shows significant advantages compared to other MLLMs. On VQAv2 val, dev and std, our model achieves 79.05, 81.04 and 81.17 accuracy respectively, which surpasses recent proposed Shikra with the same training data and procedure by a large margin, demonstrating the effectiveness of merging visual embeddings of DINOv2 and CLIP for enhancing visual capabilities. Besides, our \\textbf{COMM} model outperforms Qwen with 1.54 and 0.58 accuracy gain on VQAv2 dev and OK-VQA respectively with less VQA training data, \\emph{i.e.}, we use 0.6M and Qwen with 3.6M. Training with more VQA data might further improve performance and we leave it as future work.\n\\subsection{Ablation Study}\n\\label{sec:mae}\n\\textbf{Ablation on the MLP of DINOv2.} We conduct ablation study on the design of the MLP module in DINOv2 for aligning visual and text embedding space. \nWe ablate on the number and the expanding ratio of MLP module.\nTable~\\ref{tab:mlp} shows that increasing the number of MLP to 2 can evidently improve performance, demonstrate the effectiveness of using a more powerful network to align the vision only model DINOv2 to the word embedding space. However, increasing the number beyond 2 suffers the degraded performance. For the expanding ratio, increasing to 8 can improve performance, while increasing to 16 does not achieve significant performance gain. Moreover, we experiment with one linear layer, which suffers severe performance degradation. Thus, non-linear MLP is necessary for aligning the features of vision-only DINOv2 to the word embedding space.\n\n\\textbf{Ablation on the visual model of MAE and DeiT.} As shown in Table~\\ref{tab:deit}, MAE and DeiT suffers from evident performance degradation. For one thing, the visual features of MAE lack sufficient semantic information for global or regional understanding. For another, the supervised training of DeiT is so strong that it learns specialized visual space, making it difficult to align with the word embedding space. \n\\begin{table}[!t]\n\\centering\n\\setlength{\\tabcolsep}{2pt}\n\\caption{Ablation study on the number and expanding ratio of MLP module.

Furthermore, we recognize the potential of the vision-only model DINOv2, which leverages its inherent fine-grained pixel-level information for enhanced fine-grained perception in MLLMs when combined with an MLP layer for alignment purposes. Motivated by our analysis, we introduce a fusion approach to combine the visual features obtained from CLIP and DINOv2, thereby further augmenting the visual capabilities and performance of MLLMs. Through qualitative analysis and extensive quantitative experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, surpassing the performance of existing MLLM models across diverse benchmark datasets. Looking ahead, we encourage future research to explore the integration of more powerful vision models to enhance the capabilities of visual branches in MLLMs. We believe that this avenue of investigation holds the key to unlocking the potential of the next generation of MLLMs.\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I will use Best Mode for comprehensive thinking.

The authors rightly point out that while LLMs have achieved remarkable success in language tasks, their integration with visual information has largely relied on CLIP-like models, often without a deep exploration of alternative visual encoders or the specific contributions of different feature layers. This work addresses this gap by systematically analyzing various visual encoders and their feature representations, challenging the implicit assumption that CLIP is the optimal choice. The motivation is clear: to enhance the fine-grained visual understanding and reduce object hallucination in MLLMs, which are crucial for tasks requiring detailed visual perception. The core idea revolves around the observation that different layers of visual encoders capture distinct types of information, with shallow layers encoding low-level details and deep layers encoding high-level semantics. The authors propose that combining these complementary features can lead to improved performance, a concept that is intuitively sound. They introduce COMM, a method that fuses features from CLIP and DINOv2, leveraging CLIP's semantic understanding and DINOv2's fine-grained visual information. This fusion strategy, which includes a linear-layernorm module and a learnable scaling parameter, is designed to align the feature spaces of the two models. The inclusion of an MLP layer for DINOv2's features is a crucial step for aligning its visual features with the textual embedding space. The authors' approach is comprehensive, covering the analysis of visual encoders, the design of a feature merging strategy, and the empirical evaluation of the proposed method. \n\nThe methodology is well-structured, beginning with an analysis of visual encoders, where the authors evaluate CLIP, DINOv2, MAE, and DeiT on vision-language tasks. The finding that shallow layers of CLIP are beneficial for fine-grained tasks while deep layers excel in global understanding is insightful. The observation that DINOv2, a vision-only model, performs surprisingly well with alignment is a key contribution. The multi-level feature merging (MFM) strategy is central to COMM, and the use of linear-layernorm and learnable scaling parameters for feature alignment and merging is a reasonable approach. The MLP layer for DINOv2 alignment is a practical solution for bridging the modality gap. The COMM architecture integrates CLIP and DINOv2 with the MFM strategy, and the two-stage training process is standard practice in MLLMs. The workflow description provides a clear overview of the model's operation. The experimental design is thorough, with evaluations on Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), Referring Expression Generation (REG), Object Hallucination Benchmark (POPE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA) and Image Captioning. The choice of datasets and metrics is appropriate for each task, and the results consistently demonstrate the superior performance of COMM compared to baselines. The ablation study on the MLP module provides valuable insights into its design choices, and the ablation study on MAE and DeiT further supports the authors' claim about the suitability of CLIP and DINOv2. The results are compelling, showing that COMM achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, particularly in fine-grained tasks and in reducing object hallucination. The ablation studies provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed MFM strategy and the choice of visual encoders. The practical implication is a clear pathway for improving the visual capabilities of MLLMs. The generalizability of the findings is supported by the consistent improvements across different tasks and datasets. \n\nWhile the paper makes significant contributions, there are areas for further exploration. The theoretical understanding of why DINOv2, a vision-only model, performs so well in a multi-modal context could be further investigated. The MFM strategy, while effective, is relatively simple, and exploring more sophisticated fusion techniques could lead to further improvements. The reliance on ViT-Large models raises questions about computational cost and scalability. The comparison with baselines could be more rigorous, ensuring that all models are trained and evaluated under comparable conditions. The ablation studies could be expanded to investigate the impact of different layer combinations from CLIP and DINOv2. The paper could benefit from a more detailed analysis of failure cases to understand the limitations of the proposed approach. Future work could explore the theoretical connections between self-supervised learning in DINOv2 and its effectiveness in MLLMs, develop more adaptive feature merging strategies, investigate different pre-training objectives, and explore techniques to reduce the computational cost of COMM.  Additionally, applying COMM to other multi-modal tasks, integrating it with other types of foundation models, and optimizing the implementation for efficiency are all promising directions. Despite these potential improvements, the paper makes a significant contribution by highlighting the importance of carefully selecting and combining visual encoders in MLLMs and providing a practical and effective method for doing so.}\n\nNow, please tell me the answers to the three questions from the recent search."}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Question 1\n\nWhat are the key technical approaches used in previous multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for integrating visual and textual information, and how do these approaches differ in terms of their architectural design and training methodologies?\n\n### Passage\n\n[0] Title: Textual Knowledge Matters: Cross-Modality Co-Teaching for Generalized Visual Class Discovery **--**Text: In this paper, we study the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD), which aims to cluster unlabeled data from both known and unknown categories using the knowledge of labeled data from known categories. Current GCD methods rely on only visual cues, which however neglect the multi-modality perceptive nature of human cognitive processes in discovering novel visual categories. To address this, we propose a two-phase TextGCD framework to accomplish multi-modality GCD by exploiting powerful Visual-Language Models. TextGCD mainly includes a retrieval-based text generation (RTG) phase and a cross-modality co-teaching (CCT) phase. First, RTG constructs a visual lexicon using category tags from diverse datasets and attributes from Large Language Models, generating descriptive texts for images in a retrieval manner. Second, CCT leverages disparities between textual and visual modalities to foster mutual learning, thereby enhancing visual GCD. In addition, we design an adaptive class aligning strategy to ensure the alignment of category perceptions between modalities as well as a soft-voting mechanism to integrate multi-modality cues. Experiments on eight datasets show the large superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our approach outperforms the best competitor, by 7.7% and 10.8% in All accuracy on ImageNet-1k and CUB, respectively.\n[1] Title: VITA-1.5: Towards GPT-4o Level Real-Time Vision and Speech Interaction **--**Text: Recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have typically focused on integrating visual and textual modalities, with less emphasis placed on the role of speech in enhancing interaction. However, speech plays a crucial role in multimodal dialogue systems, and implementing high-performance in both vision and speech tasks remains a significant challenge due to the fundamental modality differences. In this paper, we propose a carefully designed multi-stage training methodology that progressively trains LLM to understand both visual and speech information, ultimately enabling fluent vision and speech interaction. Our approach not only preserves strong vision-language capacity, but also enables efficient speech-to-speech dialogue capabilities without separate ASR and TTS modules, significantly accelerating multimodal end-to-end response speed. By comparing our method against state-of-the-art counterparts across benchmarks for image, video, and speech tasks, we demonstrate that our model is equipped with both strong visual and speech capabilities, making near real-time vision and speech interaction.\n[2] Title: Retrieval-based Knowledge Augmented Vision Language Pre-training **--**Text: With the recent progress in large-scale vision and language representation learning, Vision Language Pre-training (VLP) models have achieved promising improvements on various multi-modal downstream tasks. Albeit powerful, these models have not fully leveraged world knowledge to their advantage. A key challenge of knowledge-augmented VLP is the lack of clear connections between knowledge and multi-modal data. Moreover, not all knowledge present in images/texts is useful, therefore prior approaches often struggle to effectively integrate knowledge, visual, and textual information. In this study, we propose REtrieval-based knowledge Augmented Vision Language (REAVL), a novel knowledge-augmented pre-training framework to address the above issues. For the first time, we introduce a knowledge-aware self-supervised learning scheme that efficiently establishes the correspondence between knowledge and multi-modal data and identifies informative knowledge to improve the modeling of alignment and interactions between visual and textual modalities. By adaptively integrating informative knowledge with visual and textual information, REAVL achieves new state-of-the-art performance uniformly on knowledge-based vision-language understanding and multi-modal entity linking tasks, as well as competitive results on general vision-language tasks while only using 0.2% pre-training data of the best models. Our model shows strong sample efficiency and effective knowledge utilization.\n[3] Title: GPT-4 Enhanced Multimodal Grounding for Autonomous Driving: Leveraging Cross-Modal Attention with Large Language Models **--**Text: In the field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), accurately discerning commander intent and executing linguistic commands within a visual context presents a significant challenge. This paper introduces a sophisticated encoder-decoder framework, developed to address visual grounding in AVs.Our Context-Aware Visual Grounding (CAVG) model is an advanced system that integrates five core encoders-Text, Image, Context, and Cross-Modal-with a Multimodal decoder. This integration enables the CAVG model to adeptly capture contextual semantics and to learn human emotional features, augmented by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-4. The architecture of CAVG is reinforced by the implementation of multi-head cross-modal attention mechanisms and a Region-Specific Dynamic (RSD) layer for attention modulation. This architectural design enables the model to efficiently process and interpret a range of cross-modal inputs, yielding a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between verbal commands and corresponding visual scenes. Empirical evaluations on the Talk2Car dataset, a real-world benchmark, demonstrate that CAVG establishes new standards in prediction accuracy and operational efficiency. Notably, the model exhibits exceptional performance even with limited training data, ranging from 50% to 75% of the full dataset. This feature highlights its effectiveness and potential for deployment in practical AV applications. Moreover, CAVG has shown remarkable robustness and adaptability in challenging scenarios, including long-text command interpretation, low-light conditions, ambiguous command contexts, inclement weather conditions, and densely populated urban environments. The code for the proposed model is available at our Github.\n[4] Title: SPHINX: The Joint Mixing of Weights, Tasks, and Visual Embeddings for Multi-modal Large Language Models **--**Text: We present SPHINX, a versatile multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with a joint mixing of model weights, tuning tasks, and visual embeddings. First, for stronger vision-language alignment, we unfreeze the large language model (LLM) during pre-training, and introduce a weight mix strategy between LLMs trained by real-world and synthetic data. By directly integrating the weights from two domains, the mixed LLM can efficiently incorporate diverse semantics with favorable robustness. Then, to enable multi-purpose capabilities, we mix a variety of tasks for joint visual instruction tuning, and design task-specific instructions to avoid inter-task conflict. In addition to the basic visual question answering, we include more challenging tasks such as region-level understanding, caption grounding, document layout detection, and human pose estimation, contributing to mutual enhancement over different scenarios. Additionally, we propose to extract comprehensive visual embeddings from various network architectures, pre-training paradigms, and information granularity, providing language models with more robust image representations. Based on our proposed joint mixing, SPHINX exhibits superior multi-modal understanding capabilities on a wide range of applications. On top of this, we further propose an efficient strategy aiming to better capture fine-grained appearances of high-resolution images. With a mixing of different scales and high-resolution sub-images, SPHINX attains exceptional visual parsing and reasoning performance on existing evaluation benchmarks. We hope our work may cast a light on the exploration of joint mixing in future MLLM research. Code is released at https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/LLaMA2-Accessory.\n[5] Title: Video description with integrated visual and textual information **--**Text: Video Description aims to automatically generate descriptive natural language for videos. Due to the large volume of multi-modal data and successful implementations of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), a wide range of models have been proposed. However, previous models learn insufficient linguistic information or correlation between visual and textual modalities. In order to address those problems, this paper proposes an integrated model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). This proposed model consists of triple channels in parallel: a primary video description channel, a sentence-to-sentence channel for language learning, and a channel to integrate visual and textual information. Additionally, the parallel three channels are connected by LSTM weight matrices during training. The VD-ivt model is evaluated on two publicly available datasets, i.e. Youtube2Text and LS-MDC. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed model outperforms those benchmarks.\n[6] Title: HiVLP: Hierarchical Interactive Video-Language Pre-Training **--**Text: Video-Language Pre-training (VLP) has become one of the most popular research topics in deep learning. However, compared to image-language pre-training, VLP has lagged far behind due to the lack of large amounts of video-text pairs. In this work, we train a VLP model with a hybrid of image-text and video-text pairs, which significantly outperforms pre-training with only the video-text pairs. Besides, existing methods usually model the cross-modal interaction using cross-attention between single-scale visual tokens and textual tokens. These visual features are either of low resolutions lacking fine-grained information, or of high resolutions without high-level semantics. To address the issue, we propose Hierarchical interactive Video-Language Pre-training (HiVLP) that efficiently uses a hierarchical visual feature group for multi-modal cross-attention during pre-training. In the hierarchical framework, low-resolution features are learned with focus on more global high-level semantic information, while high-resolution features carry fine-grained details. As a result, HiVLP has the ability to effectively learn both the global and fine-grained representations to achieve better alignment between video and text inputs. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical multi-scale vision contrastive loss for self-supervised learning to boost the interaction between them. Experimental results show that HiVLP establishes new state-of-the-art results in three downstream tasks, text-video retrieval, video-text retrieval, and video captioning.\n[7] Title: EMMA: Efficient Visual Alignment in Multi-Modal LLMs **--**Text: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently exhibited impressive general-purpose capabilities by leveraging vision foundation models to encode the core concepts of images into representations. These are then combined with instructions and processed by the language model to generate high-quality responses. Despite significant progress in enhancing the language component, challenges persist in optimally fusing visual encodings within the language model for task-specific adaptability. Recent research has focused on improving this fusion through modality adaptation modules but at the cost of significantly increased model complexity and training data needs. In this paper, we propose EMMA (Efficient Multi-Modal Adaptation), a lightweight cross-modality module designed to efficiently fuse visual and textual encodings, generating instruction-aware visual representations for the language model. Our key contributions include: (1) an efficient early fusion mechanism that integrates vision and language representations with minimal added parameters (less than 0.2% increase in model size), (2) an in-depth interpretability analysis that sheds light on the internal mechanisms of the proposed method; (3) comprehensive experiments that demonstrate notable improvements on both specialized and general benchmarks for MLLMs. Empirical results show that EMMA boosts performance across multiple tasks by up to 9.3% while significantly improving robustness against hallucinations. Our code is available at https://github.com/SaraGhazanfari/EMMA\n[8] Title: SimVG: A Simple Framework for Visual Grounding with Decoupled Multi-modal Fusion **--**Text: Visual grounding is a common vision task that involves grounding descriptive sentences to the corresponding regions of an image. Most existing methods use independent image-text encoding and apply complex hand-crafted modules or encoder-decoder architectures for modal interaction and query reasoning. However, their performance significantly drops when dealing with complex textual expressions. This is because the former paradigm only utilizes limited downstream data to fit the multi-modal feature fusion. Therefore, it is only effective when the textual expressions are relatively simple. In contrast, given the wide diversity of textual expressions and the uniqueness of downstream training data, the existing fusion module, which extracts multimodal content from a visual-linguistic context, has not been fully investigated. In this paper, we present a simple yet robust transformer-based framework, SimVG, for visual grounding. Specifically, we decouple visual-linguistic feature fusion from downstream tasks by leveraging existing multimodal pre-trained models and incorporating additional object tokens to facilitate deep integration of downstream and pre-training tasks. Furthermore, we design a dynamic weight-balance distillation method in the multi-branch synchronous learning process to enhance the representation capability of the simpler branch. This branch only consists of a lightweight MLP, which simplifies the structure and improves reasoning speed. Experiments on six widely used VG datasets, i.e., RefCOCO/+/g, ReferIt, Flickr30K, and GRefCOCO, demonstrate the superiority of SimVG. Finally, the proposed method not only achieves improvements in efficiency and convergence speed but also attains new state-of-the-art performance on these benchmarks. Codes and models will be available at \\url{https://github.com/Dmmm1997/SimVG}.\n[9] Title: Tackling Vision Language Tasks Through Learning Inner Monologues **--**Text: Visual language tasks such as Visual Question Answering (VQA) or Visual Entailment (VE) require AI models to comprehend and reason with both visual and textual content. Driven by the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), two prominent methods have emerged: (1) the hybrid integration between LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where visual inputs are firstly converted into language descriptions by VLMs, serving as inputs for LLMs to generate final answer(s); (2) visual feature alignment in language space, where visual inputs are encoded as embeddings and projected to LLMs' language space via further supervised fine-tuning. The first approach provides light training costs and interpretability but is hard to be optimized in an end-to-end fashion. The second approach presents decent performance, but feature alignment usually requires large amounts of training data and lacks interpretability. \nTo tackle this dilemma, we propose a novel approach, Inner Monologue Multi-Modal Optimization (IMMO), to solve complex vision language problems by simulating Inner Monologue, a cognitive process in which an individual engages in silent verbal communication with themselves. More specifically, we enable LLMs and VLMs to interact through natural language conversation (i.e., Inner Monologue) and propose to use a two-stage training process to learn how to do Inner Monologue (self-asking questions and answering questions). IMMO is evaluated on two popular tasks and achieves competitive performance with less training data when compared with state-of-the-art models while concurrently keeping the interpretability. The results suggest that by emulating the cognitive phenomenon of internal dialogue, our approach can enhance reasoning and explanation abilities, contributing to the more effective fusion of vision and language models. More importantly, instead of using predefined human-crafted monologues, IMMO learns this process within the deep learning models, broadening its potential applications across various AI challenges beyond vision and language tasks.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nPrevious multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have employed various technical approaches to integrate visual and textual information. Here, we will discuss the key approaches, their architectural designs, and training methodologies.\n\nOne approach is to use a retrieval-based knowledge augmented vision language pre-training (REAVL) framework, which establishes a connection between knowledge and multi-modal data through a knowledge-aware self-supervised learning scheme [2]. This approach efficiently integrates informative knowledge with visual and textual information, achieving state-of-the-art performance on knowledge-based vision-language understanding and multi-modal entity linking tasks.\n\nAnother approach is to use a hierarchical interactive video-language pre-training (HiVLP) framework, which leverages a hybrid of image-text and video-text pairs to train a VLP model [6]. This approach uses a hierarchical visual feature group for multi-modal cross-attention during pre-training, allowing the model to effectively learn both global and fine-grained representations to achieve better alignment between video and text inputs.\n\nA third approach is to use a simple yet robust transformer-based framework, SimVG, which decouples visual-linguistic feature fusion from downstream tasks by leveraging existing multimodal pre-trained models and incorporating additional object tokens to facilitate deep integration of downstream and pre-training tasks [8]. This approach simplifies the structure and improves reasoning speed while achieving new state-of-the-art performance on visual grounding benchmarks.\n\nIn addition, some MLLMs use a joint mixing of model weights, tuning tasks, and visual embeddings, such as SPHINX, which integrates weights from two domains, mixes a variety of tasks for joint visual instruction tuning, and extracts comprehensive visual embeddings from various network architectures and information granularity [4]. This approach enables multi-purpose capabilities and exhibits superior multi-modal understanding capabilities on a wide range of applications.\n\nFurthermore, some MLLMs use a sophisticated encoder-decoder framework, such as CAVG, which integrates five core encoders-Text, Image, Context, and Cross-Modal-with a Multimodal decoder, enabling the model to capture contextual semantics and learn human emotional features, augmented by state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-4 [3].\n\nIn terms of training methodologies, some MLLMs use a multi-stage training methodology that progressively trains LLMs to understand both visual and speech information, ultimately enabling fluent vision and speech interaction [1]. Others use a self-supervised learning scheme that establishes the correspondence between knowledge and multi-modal data and identifies informative knowledge to improve the modeling of alignment and interactions between visual and textual modalities [2].\n\nIn summary, the key technical approaches used in previous MLLMs for integrating visual and textual information include retrieval-based knowledge augmented pre-training, hierarchical interactive video-language pre-training, simple yet robust transformer-based frameworks, joint mixing of model weights, tuning tasks, and visual embeddings, and sophisticated encoder-decoder frameworks. These approaches differ in their architectural designs and training methodologies, with some focusing on establishing connections between knowledge and multi-modal data, others leveraging hierarchical visual feature groups, and others using joint mixing and sophisticated encoder-decoder frameworks.\n\n**********\n\n## Question 2\n\nHow have existing solutions to the object hallucination problem in MLLMs evolved over time, and what are the current limitations and challenges in mitigating this issue?\n\n### Passage\n\n[0] Title: MLLM can see? Dynamic Correction Decoding for Hallucination Mitigation **--**Text: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) frequently exhibit hallucination phenomena, but the underlying reasons remain poorly understood. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis and find that, although MLLMs incorrectly generate the objects in the final output, they are actually able to recognize visual objects in the preceding layers. We speculate that this may be due to the strong knowledge priors of the language model suppressing the visual information, leading to hallucinations. Motivated by this, we propose a novel dynamic correction decoding method for MLLMs (DeCo), which adaptively selects the appropriate preceding layers and proportionally integrates knowledge into the final layer to adjust the output logits. Note that DeCo is model agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated with various classic decoding strategies and applied to different MLLMs. We evaluate DeCo on widely-used benchmarks, demonstrating that it can reduce hallucination rates by a large margin compared to baselines, highlighting its potential to mitigate hallucinations. Code is available at https://github.com/zjunlp/DeCo.\n[1] Title: EFUF: Efficient Fine-Grained Unlearning Framework for Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models **--**Text: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have attracted increasing attention in the past few years, but they may still generate descriptions that include objects not present in the corresponding images, a phenomenon known as object hallucination. To eliminate hallucinations, existing methods manually annotate paired responses with and without hallucinations, and then employ various alignment algorithms to improve the alignment capability between images and text. However, they not only demand considerable computation resources during the finetuning stage but also require expensive human annotation to construct paired data needed by the alignment algorithms. To address these issues, we propose an efficient fine-grained unlearning framework (EFUF), which performs gradient ascent utilizing three tailored losses to eliminate hallucinations without paired data. Extensive experiments show that our method consistently reduces hallucinations while preserving the generation quality with modest computational overhead. Our code and datasets will be publicly available.\n[2] Title: VideoHallucer: Evaluating Intrinsic and Extrinsic Hallucinations in Large Video-Language Models **--**Text: Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have extended their capabilities to video understanding. Yet, these models are often plagued by\"hallucinations\", where irrelevant or nonsensical content is generated, deviating from the actual video context. This work introduces VideoHallucer, the first comprehensive benchmark for hallucination detection in large video-language models (LVLMs). VideoHallucer categorizes hallucinations into two main types: intrinsic and extrinsic, offering further subcategories for detailed analysis, including object-relation, temporal, semantic detail, extrinsic factual, and extrinsic non-factual hallucinations. We adopt an adversarial binary VideoQA method for comprehensive evaluation, where pairs of basic and hallucinated questions are crafted strategically. By evaluating eleven LVLMs on VideoHallucer, we reveal that i) the majority of current models exhibit significant issues with hallucinations; ii) while scaling datasets and parameters improves models' ability to detect basic visual cues and counterfactuals, it provides limited benefit for detecting extrinsic factual hallucinations; iii) existing models are more adept at detecting facts than identifying hallucinations. As a byproduct, these analyses further instruct the development of our self-PEP framework, achieving an average of 5.38% improvement in hallucination resistance across all model architectures.\n[3] Title: Data-augmented phrase-level alignment for mitigating object hallucination **--**Text: Despite their significant advancements, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often generate factually inaccurate information, referred to as hallucination. In this work, we address object hallucinations in MLLMs, where information is generated about an object not present in the input image. We introduce Data-augmented Phrase-level Alignment (DPA), a novel loss which can be applied to instruction-tuned off-the-shelf MLLMs to mitigate hallucinations, while preserving their general vision-language capabilities. To fine-tune MLLMs with DPA, we first generate a set of `hallucinated' and `correct' response pairs through generative data augmentation by selectively altering the ground-truth information of the correct responses at a phrase level. The DPA loss is then used to train MLLMs to reduce the likelihood of hallucinated phrases compared to the correct ones. Our thorough evaluation on various benchmarks confirms the effectiveness of DPA in mitigating hallucination while retaining the out-of-the-box performance of the MLLMs on general tasks. For instance, MLLMs finetuned with DPA, which we refer to as Hallucination Attenuated Language and Vision Assistant (HALVA), improve F1 by up to 13.4% on hallucination visual question-answering and reduce the hallucination rate by up to 4.2% on image description tasks.\n[4] Title: HalluciDoctor: Mitigating Hallucinatory Toxicity in Visual Instruction Data **--**Text: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tuned on machine-generated instruction-following data have demonstrated remarkable performance in various multi-modal understanding and generation tasks. However, the hallucinations inherent in machine-generated data, which could lead to hallucinatory outputs in MLLMs, remain under-explored. This work aims to investigate various hallucinations (i.e., object, relation, attribute hallucinations) and mitigate those hallucinatory toxicities in large-scale machine-generated visual instruction datasets. Drawing on the human ability to identify factual errors, we present a novel hallucination detection and elimination framework, HalluciDoctor, based on the cross-checking paradigm. We use our framework to identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically. Interestingly, HalluciDoctor also indicates that spurious correlations arising from long-tail object cooccurrences contribute to hallucinations. Based on that, we execute counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data distribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations. Comprehensive experiments on hallucination evaluation benchmarks show that our method successfully mitigates 44.6% hallucinations relatively and maintains competitive performance compared to LLaVA. The data and code for this paper are publicly available.11https://github.com/Yuqifan1117/HalluciDoctor\n[5] Title: SERPENT-VLM : Self-Refining Radiology Report Generation Using Vision Language Models **--**Text: Radiology Report Generation (R2Gen) demonstrates how Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can automate the creation of accurate and coherent radiological reports. Existing methods often hallucinate details in text-based reports that don\u2019t accurately reflect the image content. To mitigate this, we introduce a novel strategy, SERPENT-VLM (SElf Refining Radiology RePort GENeraTion using Vision Language Models), which improves the R2Gen task by integrating a self-refining mechanism into the MLLM framework. We employ a unique self-supervised loss that leverages similarity between pooled image representations and the contextual representations of the generated radiological text, alongside the standard Causal Language Modeling objective, to refine image-text representations. This allows the model to scrutinize and align the generated text through dynamic interaction between a given image and the generated text, therefore reducing hallucination and continuously enhancing nuanced report generation. SERPENT-VLM outperforms existing baselines such as LlaVA-Med, BiomedGPT, etc., achieving SoTA performance on the IU X-ray and Radiology Objects in COntext (ROCO) datasets, and also proves to be robust against noisy images. A qualitative case study emphasizes the significant advancements towards more sophisticated MLLM frameworks for R2Gen, opening paths for further research into self-supervised refinement in the medical imaging domain.\n[6] Title: Modality-Fair Preference Optimization for Trustworthy MLLM Alignment **--**Text: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is effective for aligning large language models (LLMs), but when applied to multimodal models (MLLMs), it often favors text over image information, leading to unreliable outputs and visual hallucinations. To address this, we propose Modality-Fair Preference Optimization (MFPO) to balance text and image preferences. First, we found that the lack of image-related rewards in preference data biases optimization toward text, so we created automated, fine-grained image preference data to correct this. Then, we designed a learning objective to ensure the model captures both text and image preferences while maintaining high-quality outputs. Finally, we use a multi-stage alignment approach to stabilize training and improve learning across both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFPO significantly enhances MLLM trustworthiness. On models like LLaVA-v1.5 (7B, 13B), our approach reduces hallucinations substantially. On the 7B model, MFPO outperforms GPT-4V and achieves a nearly 40\\% improvement over previous methods on Object HalBench, as well as achieving state-of-the-art performance on both Object HalBench and AMBER when combined with the latest LLaVA-v1.6. Code will be released.\n[7] Title: Hallu-PI: Evaluating Hallucination in Multi-modal Large Language Models within Perturbed Inputs **--**Text: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various visual-language understanding and generation tasks. However, MLLMs occasionally generate content inconsistent with the given images, which is known as\"hallucination\". Prior works primarily center on evaluating hallucination using standard, unperturbed benchmarks, which overlook the prevalent occurrence of perturbed inputs in real-world scenarios-such as image cropping or blurring-that are critical for a comprehensive assessment of MLLMs' hallucination. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose Hallu-PI, the first benchmark designed to evaluate Hallucination in MLLMs within Perturbed Inputs. Specifically, Hallu-PI consists of seven perturbed scenarios, containing 1,260 perturbed images from 11 object types. Each image is accompanied by detailed annotations, which include fine-grained hallucination types, such as existence, attribute, and relation. We equip these annotations with a rich set of questions, making Hallu-PI suitable for both discriminative and generative tasks. Extensive experiments on 12 mainstream MLLMs, such as GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro Vision, demonstrate that these models exhibit significant hallucinations on Hallu-PI, which is not observed in unperturbed scenarios. Furthermore, our research reveals a severe bias in MLLMs' ability to handle different types of hallucinations. We also design two baselines specifically for perturbed scenarios, namely Perturbed-Reminder and Perturbed-ICL. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to the limitations of MLLMs when dealing with perturbed inputs, and spur further investigations to address this issue. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/Hallu-PI.\n[8] Title: Reefknot: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Relation Hallucination Evaluation, Analysis and Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models **--**Text: Hallucination issues continue to affect multimodal large language models (MLLMs), with existing research mainly addressing object-level or attribute-level hallucinations, neglecting the more complex relation hallucinations that require advanced reasoning. Current benchmarks for relation hallucinations lack detailed evaluation and effective mitigation, and their datasets often suffer from biases due to systematic annotation processes. To address these challenges, we introduce Reefknot, a comprehensive benchmark targeting relation hallucinations, comprising over 20,000 real-world samples. We provide a systematic definition of relation hallucinations, integrating perceptive and cognitive perspectives, and construct a relation-based corpus using the Visual Genome scene graph dataset. Our comparative evaluation reveals significant limitations in current MLLMs' ability to handle relation hallucinations. Additionally, we propose a novel confidence-based mitigation strategy, which reduces the hallucination rate by an average of 9.75% across three datasets, including Reefknot. Our work offers valuable insights for achieving trustworthy multimodal intelligence.\n[9] Title: Leveraging Hallucinations to Reduce Manual Prompt Dependency in Promptable Segmentation **--**Text: Promptable segmentation typically requires instance-specific manual prompts to guide the segmentation of each desired object. To minimize such a need, task-generic promptable segmentation has been introduced, which employs a single task-generic prompt to segment various images of different objects in the same task. Current methods use Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to reason detailed instance-specific prompts from a task-generic prompt for improving segmentation accuracy. The effectiveness of this segmentation heavily depends on the precision of these derived prompts. However, MLLMs often suffer hallucinations during reasoning, resulting in inaccurate prompting. While existing methods focus on eliminating hallucinations to improve a model, we argue that MLLM hallucinations can reveal valuable contextual insights when leveraged correctly, as they represent pre-trained large-scale knowledge beyond individual images. In this paper, we utilize hallucinations to mine task-related information from images and verify its accuracy for enhancing precision of the generated prompts. Specifically, we introduce an iterative Prompt-Mask Cycle generation framework (ProMaC) with a prompt generator and a mask generator.The prompt generator uses a multi-scale chain of thought prompting, initially exploring hallucinations for extracting extended contextual knowledge on a test image.These hallucinations are then reduced to formulate precise instance-specific prompts, directing the mask generator to produce masks that are consistent with task semantics by mask semantic alignment. The generated masks iteratively induce the prompt generator to focus more on task-relevant image areas and reduce irrelevant hallucinations, resulting jointly in better prompts and masks. Experiments on 5 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of ProMaC. Code given in https://lwpyh.github.io/ProMaC/.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nThe object hallucination problem in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has been a persistent issue, and various solutions have been proposed to address it over time. Initially, methods focused on using paired data and alignment algorithms to eliminate hallucinations [1][3]. However, these methods require considerable computation resources and expensive human annotation to construct paired data needed by the alignment algorithms.\n\nTo address these limitations, researchers have proposed more efficient and effective solutions. For instance, the Data-augmented Phrase-level Alignment (DPA) method [3] generates hallucinated and correct response pairs through generative data augmentation and trains MLLMs to reduce the likelihood of hallucinated phrases compared to the correct ones. This approach has been shown to be effective in mitigating hallucination while retaining the out-of-the-box performance of the MLLMs on general tasks.\n\nAnother approach is the HalluciDoctor framework [4], which uses a cross-checking paradigm to identify and eliminate hallucinations in the training data automatically. This method also indicates that spurious correlations arising from long-tail object cooccurrences contribute to hallucinations and executes counterfactual visual instruction expansion to balance data distribution, thereby enhancing MLLMs' resistance to hallucinations.\n\nMore recently, researchers have proposed self-refining mechanisms to mitigate hallucination. For example, the SERPENT-VLM [5] framework integrates a self-refining mechanism into the MLLM framework, which leverages similarity between pooled image representations and the contextual representations of the generated radiological text to refine image-text representations. This approach has been shown to reduce hallucination and continuously enhance nuanced report generation.\n\nAdditionally, some studies have focused on evaluating hallucination in MLLMs within perturbed inputs [7]. The Hallu-PI benchmark, for instance, consists of seven perturbed scenarios, containing 1,260 perturbed images from 11 object types, and provides a comprehensive assessment of MLLMs' hallucination. This benchmark reveals significant hallucinations on perturbed scenarios, which are not observed in unperturbed scenarios, and highlights the limitations of MLLMs when dealing with perturbed inputs.\n\nDespite these advances, there are still challenges and limitations in mitigating object hallucination in MLLMs. One major challenge is the lack of a comprehensive benchmark for relation hallucinations, which requires advanced reasoning [8]. The current benchmarks for relation hallucinations lack detailed evaluation and effective mitigation, and their datasets often suffer from biases due to systematic annotation processes.\n\nAnother challenge is the need for more effective and efficient methods to mitigate hallucination. While some methods have shown promising results, they often require significant computational resources or expensive human annotation. Moreover, the effectiveness of these methods may vary depending on the specific MLLM architecture and task.\n\nIn summary, the evolution of solutions to the object hallucination problem in MLLMs has led to more efficient and effective methods, such as DPA, HalluciDoctor, and SERPENT-VLM. However, there are still challenges and limitations, including the need for comprehensive benchmarks, effective and efficient methods, and addressing the limitations of MLLMs when dealing with perturbed inputs.\n\n**********\n\n## Question 3\n\nWhat are the primary limitations of using image-text contrastive learning models like CLIP as the visual branch in MLLMs, and how do these limitations affect the model's performance on fine-grained vision-language tasks?\n\n### Passage\n\n[0] Title: Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-Training **--**Text: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been a celebrated method for training vision encoders to generate image/text representations facilitating various applications. Recently, CLIP has been widely adopted as the vision backbone of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to connect image inputs for language interactions. The success of CLIP as a vision-language foundation model relies on aligning web-crawled noisy text annotations at image levels. Nevertheless, such criteria may become insufficient for downstream tasks in need of fine-grained vision representations, especially when region-level understanding is demanding for MLLMs. In this paper, we improve the localization capability of CLIP with several advances. We propose a pre-training method called Contrastive Localized Language-Image Pre-training (CLOC) by complementing CLIP with region-text contrastive loss and modules. We formulate a new concept, promptable embeddings, of which the encoder produces image embeddings easy to transform into region representations given spatial hints. To support large-scale pre-training, we design a visually-enriched and spatially-localized captioning framework to effectively generate region-text pseudo-labels at scale. By scaling up to billions of annotated images, CLOC enables high-quality regional embeddings for image region recognition and retrieval tasks, and can be a drop-in replacement of CLIP to enhance MLLMs, especially on referring and grounding tasks.\n[1] Title: Bootstrap Fine-Grained Vision-Language Alignment for Unified Zero-Shot Anomaly Localization **--**Text: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have shown promising performance on zero-shot visual recognition tasks by learning visual representations under natural language supervision. Recent studies attempt the use of CLIP to tackle zero-shot anomaly detection by matching images with normal and abnormal state prompts. However, since CLIP focuses on building correspondence between paired text prompts and global image-level representations, the lack of fine-grained patch-level vision to text alignment limits its capability on precise visual anomaly localization. In this work, we propose AnoCLIP for zero-shot anomaly localization. In the visual encoder, we introduce a training-free value-wise attention mechanism to extract intrinsic local tokens of CLIP for patch-level local description. From the perspective of text supervision, we particularly design a unified domain-aware contrastive state prompting template for fine-grained vision-language matching. On top of the proposed AnoCLIP, we further introduce a test-time adaptation (TTA) mechanism to refine visual anomaly localization results, where we optimize a lightweight adapter in the visual encoder using AnoCLIP's pseudo-labels and noise-corrupted tokens. With both AnoCLIP and TTA, we significantly exploit the potential of CLIP for zero-shot anomaly localization and demonstrate the effectiveness of AnoCLIP on various datasets.\n[2] Title: From CLIP to DINO: Visual Encoders Shout in Multi-modal Large Language Models **--**Text: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in expanding the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the incorporation of visual perception interfaces. Despite the emergence of exciting applications and the availability of diverse instruction tuning data, existing approaches often rely on CLIP or its variants as the visual branch, and merely extract features from the deep layers. However, these methods lack a comprehensive analysis of the visual encoders in MLLMs. In this paper, we conduct an extensive investigation into the effectiveness of different vision encoders within MLLMs. Our findings reveal that the shallow layer features of CLIP offer particular advantages for fine-grained tasks such as grounding and region understanding. Surprisingly, the vision-only model DINO, which is not pretrained with text-image alignment, demonstrates promising performance as a visual branch within MLLMs. By simply equipping it with an MLP layer for alignment, DINO surpasses CLIP in fine-grained related perception tasks. Building upon these observations, we propose a simple yet effective feature merging strategy, named COMM, that integrates CLIP and DINO with Multi-level features Merging, to enhance the visual capabilities of MLLMs. We evaluate COMM through comprehensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including image captioning, visual question answering, visual grounding, and object hallucination. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of COMM compared to existing methods, showcasing its enhanced visual capabilities within MLLMs.\n[3] Title: RAR: Retrieving And Ranking Augmented MLLMs for Visual Recognition **--**Text: CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) uses contrastive learning from noise image-text pairs to excel at recognizing a wide array of candidates, yet its focus on broad associations hinders the precision in distinguishing subtle differences among fine-grained items. Conversely, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at classifying fine-grained categories, thanks to their substantial knowledge from pre-training on web-level corpora. However, the performance of MLLMs declines with an increase in category numbers, primarily due to growing complexity and constraints of limited context window size. To synergize the strengths of both approaches and enhance the few-shot/zero-shot recognition abilities for datasets characterized by extensive and fine-grained vocabularies, this paper introduces RAR, a Retrieving And Ranking augmented method for MLLMs. We initially establish a multi-modal retriever based on CLIP to create and store explicit memory for different categories beyond the immediate context window. During inference, RAR retrieves the top-k similar results from the memory and uses MLLMs to rank and make the final predictions. Our proposed approach not only addresses the inherent limitations in fine-grained recognition but also preserves the model's comprehensive knowledge base, significantly boosting accuracy across a range of vision-language recognition tasks. Notably, our approach demonstrates a significant improvement in performance on 5 fine-grained visual recognition benchmarks, 11 few-shot image recognition datasets, and the 2 object detection datasets under the zero-shot recognition setting.\n[4] Title: DetailCLIP: Detail-Oriented CLIP for Fine-Grained Tasks **--**Text: In this paper, we introduce DetailCLIP: A Detail-Oriented CLIP to address the limitations of contrastive learning-based vision-language models, particularly CLIP, in handling detail-oriented and fine-grained tasks like segmentation. While CLIP and its variants excel in the global alignment of image and text representations, they often struggle to capture the fine-grained details necessary for precise segmentation. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel framework that employs patch-level comparison of self-distillation and pixel-level reconstruction losses, enhanced with an attention-based token removal mechanism. This approach selectively retains semantically relevant tokens, enabling the model to focus on the image's critical regions aligned with the specific functions of our model, including textual information processing, patch comparison, and image reconstruction, ensuring that the model learns high-level semantics and detailed visual features. Our experiments demonstrate that DetailCLIP surpasses existing CLIP-based and traditional self-supervised learning (SSL) models in segmentation accuracy and exhibits superior generalization across diverse datasets. DetailCLIP represents a significant advancement in vision-language modeling, offering a robust solution for tasks that demand high-level semantic understanding and detailed feature extraction. https://github.com/KishoreP1/DetailCLIP.\n[5] Title: CLIP-ReID: Exploiting Vision-Language Model for Image Re-Identification without Concrete Text Labels **--**Text: Pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP have recently shown superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification and segmentation. However, in fine-grained image re-identification (ReID), the labels are indexes, lacking concrete text descriptions. Therefore, it remains to be determined how such models could be applied to these tasks. This paper first finds out that simply fine-tuning the visual model initialized by the image encoder in CLIP, has already obtained competitive performances in various ReID tasks. Then we propose a two-stage strategy to facilitate a better visual representation. The key idea is to fully exploit the cross-modal description ability in CLIP through a set of learnable text tokens for each ID and give them to the text encoder to form ambiguous descriptions. In the first training stage, image and text encoders from CLIP keep fixed, and only the text tokens are optimized from scratch by the contrastive loss computed within a batch. In the second stage, the ID-specific text tokens and their encoder become static, providing constraints for fine-tuning the image encoder. With the help of the designed loss in the downstream task, the image encoder is able to represent data as vectors in the feature embedding accurately. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is validated on several datasets for the person or vehicle ReID tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Syliz517/CLIP-ReID.\n[6] Title: RegionCLIP: Region-based Language-Image Pretraining **--**Text: Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) using image-text pairs has achieved impressive results on image classification in both zero-shot and transfer learning set-tings. However, we show that directly applying such mod-els to recognize image regions for object detection leads to unsatisfactory performance due to a major domain shift: CLIP was trained to match an image as a whole to a text de-scription, without capturing the fine-grained alignment be-tween image regions and text spans. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new method called RegionCLIP that signifi-cantly extends CLIP to learn region-level visual representations, thus enabling fine-grained alignment between image regions and textual concepts. Our method leverages a CLIP model to match image regions with template captions, and then pretrains our model to align these region-text pairs in the feature space. When transferring our pretrained model to the open-vocabulary object detection task, our method outperforms the state of the art by 3.8 AP50 and 2.2 AP for novel categories on COCO and LVIS datasets, respectively. Further, the learned region representations support zero-shot inference for object detection, showing promising results on both COCO and LVIS datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/microsoft/RegionCLIP.\n[7] Title: LightCLIP: Learning Multi-Level Interaction for Lightweight Vision-Language Models **--**Text: Vision-language pre-training like CLIP has shown promising performance on various downstream tasks such as zero-shot image classification and image-text retrieval. Most of the existing CLIP-alike works usually adopt relatively large image encoders like ResNet50 and ViT, while the lightweight counterparts are rarely discussed. In this paper, we propose a multi-level interaction paradigm for training lightweight CLIP models. Firstly, to mitigate the problem that some image-text pairs are not strictly one-to-one correspondence, we improve the conventional global instance-level alignment objective by softening the label of negative samples progressively. Secondly, a relaxed bipartite matching based token-level alignment objective is introduced for finer-grained alignment between image patches and textual words. Moreover, based on the observation that the accuracy of CLIP model does not increase correspondingly as the parameters of text encoder increase, an extra objective of masked language modeling (MLM) is leveraged for maximizing the potential of the shortened text encoder. In practice, an auxiliary fusion module injecting unmasked image embedding into masked text embedding at different network stages is proposed for enhancing the MLM. Extensive experiments show that without introducing additional computational cost during inference, the proposed method achieves a higher performance on multiple downstream tasks.\n[8] Title: Contrasting Intra-Modal and Ranking Cross-Modal Hard Negatives to Enhance Visio-Linguistic Fine-grained Understanding **--**Text: Current Vision and Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong performance across various vision-language tasks, yet they struggle with \ufb01ne-grained understanding. This issue stems from weak image-caption alignment in pretraining datasets and a simpli\ufb01ed contrastive objective that fails to distinguish nuanced grounding elements such as relations, actions, and attributes. As a result, the models tend to learn bag-of-words representations. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce an intra-modal contrastive loss and a unique cross-modal rank loss with an adaptive threshold that serves as curriculum learning, utilizing our automatically generated hard negatives to augment the model\u2019s capacity. Our strategy, which does not necessitate additional annotations or parameters, can be incorporated into any VLM trained with an image-text contrastive loss. Upon application to CLIP, our method leads to signi\ufb01cant improvements on three \ufb01ne-grained benchmarks, and it also enhances the performance of X-VLM, which is the state-of-art moodel on \ufb01ne-grained reasoning. 1\n[9] Title: Machine Vision Therapy: Multimodal Large Language Models Can Enhance Visual Robustness via Denoising In-Context Learning **--**Text: Although vision models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) show impressive generalization performance, their zero-shot robustness is still limited under Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios without fine-tuning. Instead of undesirably providing human supervision as commonly done, it is possible to take advantage of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that hold powerful visual understanding abilities. However, MLLMs are shown to struggle with vision problems due to the incompatibility of tasks, thus hindering their utilization. In this paper, we propose to effectively leverage MLLMs to conduct Machine Vision Therapy which aims to rectify the noisy predictions from vision models. By fine-tuning with the denoised labels, the learning model performance can be boosted in an unsupervised manner. To solve the incompatibility issue, we propose a novel Denoising In-Context Learning (DICL) strategy to align vision tasks with MLLMs. Concretely, by estimating a transition matrix that captures the probability of one class being confused with another, an instruction containing a correct exemplar and an erroneous one from the most probable noisy class can be constructed. Such an instruction can help any MLLMs with ICL ability to detect and rectify incorrect predictions of vision models. Through extensive experiments on ImageNet, WILDS, DomainBed, and other OOD datasets, we carefully validate the quantitative and qualitative effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/tmllab/Machine_Vision_Therapy.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nThe primary limitations of using image-text contrastive learning models like CLIP as the visual branch in MLLMs are: (1) lack of fine-grained alignment between image regions and text spans, (2) limited ability to capture detailed visual features, and (3) difficulty in distinguishing nuanced grounding elements such as relations, actions, and attributes [6][8]. These limitations can significantly impact the model's performance on fine-grained vision-language tasks, such as object detection, segmentation, and image re-identification [6][7][8].\n\nTo address these limitations, several approaches have been proposed. For example, RegionCLIP [6] extends CLIP to learn region-level visual representations, enabling fine-grained alignment between image regions and textual concepts. DetailCLIP [4] employs patch-level comparison of self-distillation and pixel-level reconstruction losses, enhanced with an attention-based token removal mechanism, to capture detailed visual features. CLIP-ReID [5] exploits the cross-modal description ability in CLIP through a set of learnable text tokens for each ID, allowing for fine-grained image re-identification. RAR [3] uses a multi-modal retriever based on CLIP to create and store explicit memory for different categories, addressing the limitations of fine-grained recognition. LightCLIP [7] proposes a multi-level interaction paradigm for training lightweight CLIP models, improving the accuracy of CLIP models without increasing the number of parameters.\n\nThese approaches demonstrate the potential of addressing the limitations of image-text contrastive learning models like CLIP as the visual branch in MLLMs, enabling the models to perform well on fine-grained vision-language tasks.\n\n**********\n\n"}], "output": "Thank you for your help!

The authors explore the use of CLIP and DINOv2 as visual branches and propose a feature merging strategy called COMM (CLIP and DINO with Multi-level features Merging) to enhance the visual capabilities of MLLMs. The paper evaluates COMM on a wide range of benchmarks, including image captioning, visual question answering, visual grounding, and object hallucination.\n\n### Soundness\n\n2\n\n### Presentation\n\n2\n\n### Contribution\n\n2\n\n### Strengths\n\nThe paper proposes a feature merging strategy that integrates CLIP and DINOv2 with multi-level features merging, which enhances the visual capabilities of MLLMs.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n[1] SERPENT-VLM: Self-Refining Radiology Report Generation Using Vision Language Models\n[2] VITRON: A Unified Framework for Video-Text Alignment Optimization in LLM-Video Models\n[3] Enhancing Visual-Language Modality Alignment in Large Vision-Language Models via Contrastive Region-Image Binding\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The contribution of this work is quite weak. The authors simply combine CLIP and DINOv2 for MLLMs and draw conclusions based on a large number of experiments. However, the conclusions are relatively obvious, as DINOv2 is a general image pre-training model that excels in various vision tasks, while CLIP is specifically designed for vision-language tasks. It is expected that the integration of these two models would yield strong performance, and the experimental results are also very obvious. Therefore, the authors need to provide more in-depth explanations and insights to enhance the contribution of this paper.\n\n2. The COMM method proposed in this paper is too simplistic. The authors only use a few layers from CLIP and DINOv2 for feature merging, and then use LayerScale for multi-level feature merging. This method is too straightforward and lacks novelty. The authors should consider more innovative methods for feature merging to enhance the value of the paper.\n\n3. The COMM method proposed in this paper is not suitable for most MLLMs. The COMM method requires the use of both CLIP and DINOv2, which leads to a very large visual feature length. Most MLLMs are built on LLMs with a fixed maximum input length (such as LLaMA2 with a maximum length of 4096), and the length of visual features occupied by COMM is too long, making it impossible to apply to most MLLMs. The authors need to consider more efficient feature merging methods to make COMM more broadly applicable.\n\n4. The COMM method proposed in this paper lacks theoretical explanations. The authors need a more in-depth analysis of why the COMM method can enhance the visual capabilities of MLLMs. This would enhance the persuasiveness and value of the paper.\n\n5. The COMM method proposed in this paper lacks generalizability. The COMM method is only applied to the Shikra framework, and the authors need to apply COMM to more MLLMs to demonstrate its generalizability.\n\n6. The COMM method proposed in this paper lacks innovation. The authors need to consider more efficient and innovative methods for feature merging to enhance the value of the paper.\n\n7. The COMM method proposed in this paper lacks generalization performance. The COMM method is only applied to a few general visual tasks, and the authors need to apply COMM to more specific visual tasks, such as medical report generation [1], video-based MLLMs [2], etc.\n\n8. The COMM method proposed in this paper lacks interpretability. The COMM method only shows the improvement in experimental results but lacks an in-depth analysis of the reasons for the improvement, which reduces the interpretability of the method.\n\n9. The COMM method proposed in this paper lacks the advantages demonstrated in the paper. The COMM method is a simple combination of CLIP and DINOv2, lacking innovation and interpretability, and not demonstrating the advantages required by the paper.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper's core idea of combining CLIP and DINOv2 for MLLMs, while intuitively appealing, lacks sufficient novelty and depth. The authors should explore more sophisticated fusion techniques beyond simple layer selection and LayerScale. For instance, they could investigate attention-based mechanisms to dynamically weigh the contributions of different layers from CLIP and DINOv2, or explore cross-attention modules that allow for more fine-grained interaction between the features. Furthermore, the current approach of using a fixed set of layers from each model might not be optimal for all tasks. An adaptive layer selection mechanism, perhaps guided by a task-specific objective, could lead to more robust and generalizable performance. The authors should also consider the computational overhead of their approach, as the concatenation of features from two large models can lead to significant increases in memory and computation costs. Exploring techniques like feature compression or knowledge distillation could help mitigate these issues and make the method more practical for real-world applications.\n\nTo address the lack of theoretical grounding, the authors should delve deeper into the underlying reasons why combining CLIP and DINOv2 in this manner leads to performance improvements. While the paper mentions the different strengths of the two models, a more rigorous analysis is needed. For example, they could analyze the feature spaces of CLIP and DINOv2 to understand how they complement each other, and how the merging process affects the resulting feature representation. Visualizing the feature maps or using techniques like t-SNE to project the high-dimensional features into a lower-dimensional space could provide valuable insights. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the impact of different merging strategies on the resulting feature representation. A more thorough analysis of the feature space would not only enhance the theoretical understanding of the method but also provide guidance for future research in this area. The authors should also consider the limitations of their approach, such as the potential for negative transfer or the sensitivity to the choice of layers, and discuss how these limitations could be addressed in future work.\n\nFinally, the paper needs to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed method across a wider range of MLLMs and tasks. The current evaluation is limited to a few general visual tasks and a single MLLM framework. The authors should evaluate their method on more challenging and specific tasks, such as medical image analysis or video understanding, to demonstrate its broader applicability. They should also consider applying their method to other MLLM architectures, such as those based on different LLM backbones, to assess its robustness. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of their method, including the memory footprint and inference time. This would help to assess the practical feasibility of the method for real-world applications. The authors should also consider the potential for bias in their evaluation datasets and discuss how this could affect the results. A more thorough and rigorous evaluation would significantly strengthen the paper and enhance its impact.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease refer to the weaknesses.\n\n### Rating\n\n3\n\n### Confidence\n\n5\n\n**********\n\n## Reviewer 2\n\n### Summary\n\nThis paper presents an extensive investigation into the effectiveness of different visual encoders within MLLMs. The authors propose a simple yet effective feature merging strategy, named COMM, that integrates CLIP and DINO with Multi-level features Merging, to enhance the visual capabilities of MLLMs. The proposed method is evaluated through comprehensive experiments on a wide range of benchmarks, including image captioning, visual question answering, visual grounding, and object hallucination. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of COMM compared to existing methods, showcasing its enhanced visual capabilities within MLLMs.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3\n\n### Presentation\n\n3\n\n### Contribution\n\n3\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. This paper is the first to extensively investigate the effectiveness of different visual encoders for MLLMs. Based on the analysis that shallow layer features contain low-level detailed information which is helpful for fine-grained tasks, the authors propose a multi-level feature fusion strategy to incorporate low-level and high-level features for improving representation.\n2. The proposed COMM method achieves promising results in MLLMs with only an MLP layer for alignment. Considering fine-grained pixel information in DINOv2 and global semantic information in CLIP, the authors propose COMM to fuse the visual embeddings of these two models to enhance visual capabilities for boosting MLLMs.\n3. Extensive experiments on a wide range of tasks including visual grounding, referring expression generation, object hallucination, visual question answering and image captioning demonstrate the superiority of COMM over existing works.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The COMM method requires the use of both CLIP and DINOv2, which leads to a very large visual feature length. Most MLLMs are built on LLMs with a fixed maximum input length (such as LLaMA2 with a maximum length of 4096), and the length of visual features occupied by COMM is too long, making it impossible to apply to most MLLMs. The authors need to consider more efficient feature merging methods to make COMM more broadly applicable. Specifically, the concatenation of features from both models, even with multi-level merging, results in a feature vector that could easily exceed the typical context window of transformer-based LLMs, creating a significant bottleneck for practical deployment.\n2.

A more rigorous theoretical framework is needed to justify the empirical results.\n4. The COMM method proposed in this paper lacks generalizability. The COMM method is only applied to the Shikra framework, and the authors need to apply COMM to more MLLMs to demonstrate its generalizability. The evaluation is limited to a single architecture, making it difficult to assess the robustness of the proposed method across different MLLM designs. The authors should evaluate the method on a diverse set of MLLM architectures to demonstrate its broad applicability.\n5. The COMM method proposed in this paper lacks innovation. The authors need to consider more efficient and innovative methods for feature merging to enhance the value of the paper. The proposed feature merging strategy, while effective, is relatively straightforward and does not introduce significant novelty in terms of architectural design or learning mechanisms. The authors should explore more sophisticated feature fusion techniques.\n6. The COMM method proposed in this paper lacks generalization performance. The COMM method is only applied to a few general visual tasks, and the authors need to apply COMM to more specific visual tasks, such as medical report generation [1], video-based MLLMs [2], etc. The evaluation is limited to a narrow set of visual tasks, and the authors should demonstrate the method's effectiveness on a wider range of applications, including those with more complex and specialized visual inputs.\n7. The COMM method proposed in this paper lacks interpretability. The COMM method only shows the improvement in experimental results but lacks an in-depth analysis of the reasons for the improvement, which reduces the interpretability of the method.

The COMM method is a simple combination of CLIP and DINOv2, lacking innovation and interpretability, and not demonstrating the advantages required by the paper.

This could involve methods such as principal component analysis (PCA), autoencoders, or other feature selection techniques. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the possibility of using more efficient feature merging strategies that do not rely on the concatenation of all feature levels. For example, they could explore attention-based mechanisms to selectively combine the most relevant features from CLIP and DINOv2, or investigate knowledge distillation techniques to transfer the knowledge of the combined model into a more compact representation. This would make the method more applicable to a wider range of MLLMs and deployment scenarios.\n\nTo enhance the theoretical grounding of the COMM method, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the feature spaces of CLIP and DINOv2. This could involve visualizing the feature distributions, analyzing the correlation between different feature levels, and investigating the impact of different merging strategies on the resulting feature representation. A formal analysis of the information content of the different feature levels would also be beneficial. The authors should also explore the possibility of using techniques such as information bottleneck to identify the most informative features for the downstream tasks. This would provide a more solid theoretical foundation for the proposed method and help to understand why it works.\n\nFinally, the authors should significantly broaden the evaluation of the COMM method to include a more diverse set of MLLM architectures and visual tasks. This should include evaluating the method on different LLM backbones, such as LLaMA3, and on more specialized tasks such as medical image analysis or video understanding. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, including the memory footprint and inference time. This would help to assess the practical feasibility of the method for real-world applications.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces COMM, a novel approach to enhance the visual capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by integrating the strengths of CLIP and DINOv2 through a multi-level feature merging strategy. The authors' core contribution lies in their investigation of different visual encoders within MLLMs, demonstrating that combining the global semantic understanding of CLIP with the fine-grained localization information from DINOv2 leads to improved performance across a range of vision-language tasks. The COMM method employs a multi-level feature merging (MFM) strategy, which aligns and combines features from different layers of both CLIP and DINOv2 using a linear layer, layer normalization, and learnable scaling parameters. For DINOv2, which lacks inherent text alignment, an MLP layer is used to project its features into the word embedding space. The authors evaluate their method on a variety of benchmarks, including image captioning, visual question answering, visual grounding, and object hallucination, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods. The empirical findings suggest that the proposed feature merging strategy effectively leverages the complementary strengths of CLIP and DINOv2, resulting in enhanced visual understanding within MLLMs. The paper's overall significance lies in its exploration of visual encoder effectiveness and the introduction of a practical method for improving visual capabilities in MLLMs. However, the paper also presents several limitations, particularly in terms of the practical applicability of the method due to the large feature vector size, the lack of a strong theoretical foundation, and the limited generalizability of the results. Despite these limitations, the paper provides valuable insights into the potential of combining different visual encoders for MLLMs and offers a promising direction for future research.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nI find several aspects of this paper to be commendable. Firstly, the paper's core idea of combining CLIP and DINOv2 to leverage their complementary strengths is both intuitive and effective. The authors' analysis of the different biases of CLIP and DINOv2, with CLIP excelling in global understanding and DINOv2 capturing fine-grained details, provides a solid rationale for their approach. The empirical results, demonstrating superior performance on a range of vision-language tasks, validate the effectiveness of the proposed COMM method. Specifically, the performance gains on tasks like Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), Object Hallucination Benchmark (POPE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA) are significant and showcase the enhanced visual capabilities of MLLMs when using COMM. The authors' exploration of different feature merging strategies, including the use of linear-layernorm and learnable scaling parameters, is a valuable contribution. The use of an MLP layer to align DINOv2's features with the word embedding space is also a practical and effective solution. Furthermore, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, making the methodology and results accessible to a broad audience. The authors' focus on practical application and empirical validation is a strength, as it demonstrates the real-world potential of their approach. The paper's exploration of visual encoder effectiveness within MLLMs is a significant contribution, as it highlights the importance of carefully selecting and combining visual encoders to achieve optimal performance. Finally, the paper's demonstration of the COMM method's ability to enhance visual capabilities in MLLMs is a promising direction for future research in this field.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several significant weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. The most pressing limitation is the practical applicability of the COMM method due to the large visual feature length. The authors explicitly state that they concatenate features from both CLIP and DINOv2, which are both based on ViT-Large. Given the image resolution of 336x336 and the downsampling rate of 14, each encoder outputs 576 tokens per layer. Concatenating features from multiple layers of both encoders results in a feature vector that can easily exceed the context window of standard LLMs like LLaMA2, which has a maximum input length of 4096 tokens. This is a critical issue, as it makes it difficult to apply the COMM method to most existing MLLMs without significant modifications or feature compression techniques. This limitation is explicitly stated in the paper, where the authors mention the concatenation of features and the resulting token sequence (lines 296-298). My analysis confirms that this concatenation, even with multi-level merging, leads to a feature vector that could easily exceed the typical context window of transformer-based LLMs, creating a significant bottleneck for practical deployment. This is a high-confidence concern, as it is directly supported by the paper's methodology and the known limitations of standard LLMs. \n\nFurthermore, the reliance on two distinct visual encoders introduces a computational overhead that may not be feasible for resource-constrained environments or real-time applications. The paper confirms the use of both CLIP and DINOv2 as visual encoders (lines 291-292). Processing two large visual encoders and handling the resulting large feature vector will undoubtedly increase the computational cost, making the method less practical for deployment in resource-constrained environments. This is another high-confidence concern, as it is a direct consequence of the method's design. The paper lacks a strong theoretical foundation to explain why the COMM method enhances the visual capabilities of MLLMs. While the authors provide some intuition about the complementary strengths of CLIP and DINOv2, there is no formal analysis of the feature spaces or a theoretical framework explaining the benefits of the specific merging strategy. The paper mentions that shallow layers capture local details and deep layers capture global semantics (lines 49-52), and that DINOv2 captures fine-grained localization (lines 53-55). However, there is no mathematical analysis of the feature spaces of CLIP and DINOv2, nor is there a formal justification for the chosen merging strategy. This lack of theoretical grounding makes it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms of the method and limits the generalizability of the findings. This is a high-confidence concern, as it is evident from the absence of a formal theoretical framework in the paper. The COMM method's generalizability is also limited, as it is primarily evaluated within the Shikra framework. The paper explicitly mentions using Vicuna as the language decoder and following the training setup of Shikra (lines 291-294, 311-313). While the architecture description is general, the experimental setup heavily relies on the Shikra framework's training data and procedure. This makes it difficult to assess the robustness of the proposed method across different MLLM designs. This is a high-confidence concern, as it is directly supported by the paper's experimental setup. The COMM method also lacks significant innovation in terms of feature merging techniques. The paper describes the MFM strategy as involving linear-layernorm for alignment and learnable scaling parameters for merging (lines 59-61). For DINOv2, an MLP is used for alignment (lines 61-63). While effective, these techniques are relatively standard and do not represent a significant architectural innovation. This is a high-confidence concern, as it is evident from the description of the MFM strategy in the paper. The paper's evaluation is limited to a few general visual tasks, such as REC, REG, POPE, VQA, and Image Captioning (lines 320-322). It does not include more specialized domains like medical imaging or video understanding. This lack of evaluation on specialized tasks limits the understanding of COMM's performance in more complex and domain-specific scenarios. This is a high-confidence concern, as it is evident from the list of evaluated tasks in the paper. Finally, the paper lacks sufficient interpretability, as it does not provide a detailed analysis of how the different feature levels contribute to the overall performance. While the paper provides some high-level analysis of feature layer contributions (lines 137-138, 142-144) and shows performance improvements, there is no detailed analysis of how the learnable scaling parameters in the MFM strategy affect the contribution of different feature levels, or a deeper dive into the interaction between CLIP and DINOv2 features. This lack of interpretability makes it harder to understand the specific mechanisms behind the performance gains and limits the ability to further refine the method. This is a high-confidence concern, as it is evident from the lack of detailed analysis in the paper. The paper also fails to convincingly demonstrate the unique advantages of the proposed method over existing approaches, particularly given the increased computational cost and complexity. While the paper shows performance improvements, the simplicity of the method and lack of deep interpretability, coupled with potential computational costs, might not fully justify the claimed advantages. This is a medium-confidence concern, as it is a more subjective assessment of the paper's overall contribution. In summary, while the paper presents a promising approach, these limitations significantly impact its practical applicability and generalizability.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. Firstly, the authors should explore techniques to reduce the dimensionality of the combined feature space. Given the concatenation of features from both CLIP and DINOv2, the resulting feature vector can be quite large, potentially exceeding the context window of standard LLMs. To mitigate this, the authors could investigate methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or autoencoders to compress the feature representation while preserving the most informative components. This would make the method more applicable to a wider range of MLLMs and deployment scenarios. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the possibility of using more efficient feature merging strategies that do not rely on the concatenation of all feature levels. For example, they could explore attention-based mechanisms to selectively combine the most relevant features from CLIP and DINOv2. This would allow the model to focus on the most informative features, reducing the dimensionality of the combined feature space and potentially improving performance. Another approach could be to investigate knowledge distillation techniques to transfer the knowledge of the combined model into a more compact representation. This would allow the authors to leverage the performance of the combined model while reducing the computational cost of deployment. To enhance the theoretical grounding of the COMM method, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the feature spaces of CLIP and DINOv2. This could involve visualizing the feature distributions, analyzing the correlation between different feature levels, and investigating the impact of different merging strategies on the resulting feature representation. A formal analysis of the information content of the different feature levels would also be beneficial. The authors should also explore the possibility of using techniques such as information bottleneck to identify the most informative features for the downstream tasks. This would provide a more solid theoretical foundation for the proposed method and help to understand why it works. To address the limited generalizability of the method, the authors should significantly broaden the evaluation of the COMM method to include a more diverse set of MLLM architectures and visual tasks. This should include evaluating the method on different LLM backbones, such as LLaMA3, and on more specialized tasks such as medical image analysis or video understanding. The authors should also provide a more detailed analysis of the computational cost of the proposed method, including the memory footprint and inference time. This would help to assess the practical feasibility of the method for real-world applications. Furthermore, the authors should provide a more detailed analysis of the interpretability of the method, including visualizing the contribution of different feature levels to the final prediction. This would help to understand the underlying mechanisms of the proposed method and provide insights for further improvements. Finally, the authors should explore more sophisticated feature fusion techniques to enhance the innovation of the method. This could involve exploring cross-attention mechanisms that allow for more fine-grained interaction between the features of CLIP and DINOv2, or investigating adaptive layer selection mechanisms, perhaps guided by a task-specific objective. These improvements would not only address the identified weaknesses but also enhance the overall impact and significance of the paper.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nI have several questions regarding the methodology and results presented in this paper. Firstly, given the significant increase in visual feature length due to the concatenation of CLIP and DINOv2 features, what specific strategies do the authors propose to mitigate the context window limitations of standard LLMs? Have they explored any feature compression techniques or alternative merging strategies that could reduce the dimensionality of the combined feature space without sacrificing performance? Secondly, considering the lack of a formal theoretical framework, what specific analyses have the authors conducted to understand the interaction between the feature spaces of CLIP and DINOv2? Have they visualized the feature distributions or analyzed the correlation between different feature levels? What is the rationale behind the specific merging strategy, and how does it impact the information content of the resulting feature representation? Thirdly, given the limited evaluation of the COMM method on the Shikra framework, what are the authors' plans to evaluate the method on a more diverse set of MLLM architectures? What specific challenges do they anticipate when applying the method to different LLM backbones, and how do they plan to address these challenges? Fourthly, considering the relatively straightforward nature of the feature merging strategy, what are the authors' plans to explore more sophisticated feature fusion techniques? Have they considered attention-based mechanisms or adaptive layer selection mechanisms? What are the potential benefits and drawbacks of these more complex approaches? Fifthly, given the limited evaluation on general visual tasks, what are the authors' plans to evaluate the method on more specialized domains, such as medical image analysis or video understanding? What specific challenges do they anticipate when applying the method to these more complex and domain-specific scenarios? Finally, considering the lack of interpretability of the method, what specific analyses have the authors conducted to understand the contribution of different feature levels to the final prediction? Have they visualized the feature maps or used techniques like t-SNE to project the high-dimensional features into a lower-dimensional space? What are the specific mechanisms behind the performance gains observed with the COMM method?\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n4.5\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n5.0\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nReject\n}"}}, {"id": "sqRgz88TM3", "title": "VFLAIR: A Research Library and Benchmark for Vertical Federated Learning", "paper_context": "\\title{VFLAIR: A Research Library and Benchmark for Vertical Federated Learning}\n\n\\begin{abstract}\n  Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as a collaborative training paradigm that allows participants with different features of the same group of users to accomplish cooperative training without exposing their raw data or model parameters.

In another type of FL, regarded as Vertical FL (VFL)~\\citep{yang2019federatedbook}, data are partitioned by feature. VFL is often applied in industrial collaborative learning scenarios where each organization controls disjoint features of a common group of users. In VFL, local data and local model are kept private at each participant. Instead, local model outputs and their gradients are transmitted between parties.\n\nVFL has drawn increasing attention from both academic and industry in recent years with hundreds of research papers published every year and a number of open-sourced projects released, including FATE~\\citep{FATE,liu2021fate}, Fedlearner~\\citep{Fedlearner}, PaddleFL~\\citep{PaddleFL}, Pysyft~\\citep{ryffel2018generic,romanini2021pyvertical}, FedTree~\\citep{fedtree2022}, and FedML~\\citep{he2020fedml}. Real-world industrial cases are also emerged in the field of advertising~\\citep{cai2020Bytedance,tencent2021} and finance~\\citep{cheng2020federated,Cheng2022DigitalEra} etc. However, mainstream VFL projects such as FATE are industrial grade and not designed for keeping up with research advances.  %, to name a few.\n\nMeanwhile, research interests for VFL have been growing rapidly over the past years, focusing on improving various aspects of VFL protocols, such as communication efficiency~\\citep{fu2021vf2boost,liu2022fedbcd,castiglia2022compressed,fu2022towards}, robustness to attacks~\\citep{liu2021rvfr,cheng2021secureboost,li2022label,zou2022defending,zou2023mutual,sun2022label,yang2022differentially}, model utility~\\citep{li2022semi,Yitao2022multiview,feng2020multi,feng2022semisupervised}, and fair incentive designs~\\citep{liu2021achieving,qi2022fairvfl}. % are two main lines of reserach work considering VFL. \nFor communication efficiency, methods like decrease communication rounds using multiple local updates between each round~\\citep{liu2022fedbcd,fu2022towards} or compress information~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} have been proposed. As for data security and privacy, various attacks injected by one or multiple parties aiming to either steal other parties' private label~\\citep{li2022label,fu2021label,zou2022defending}, private features~\\citep{jin2021cafe,luo2021feature,li2022ressfl,jiang2022comprehensive,ye2022feature}, sensitive attributes~\\citep{Song2020Overlearning} and sample relations~\\citep{qiu2022your}, or negatively impact the model behavior~\\citep{liu2021rvfr,zou2022defending} have been put forward. Multiple defending methods have also been proposed to tackle these threats, including adding noise~\\citep{dwork2006DP,zou2022defending,li2022label}, sparsifying gradients~\\citep{aji2017sparse,fu2021label,zou2022defending}, discreting gradients~\\citep{fu2021label}, label differential privacy~\\citep{ghazi2021deep,yang2022differentially}, adding distance correlation regularizor~\\citep{sun2022label,vepakomma2019reducing}, disguising labels~\\citep{zou2022defending}, adding mutual information regularizer~\\citep{zou2023mutual}, adversarial training~\\citep{sun2021defending,li2022ressfl} or performing robust feature recovery~\\citep{liu2021rvfr}. However, each of these defenses are evaluated under specific tasks and settings, lacking of key insights and metrics on evaluating these defense strategies to defend all possible attacks in practical deployment.\n\nTo facilitate future research for VFL, we introduce a lightweight and comprehensive VFL framework, namely \\verb|VFLAIR|, which includes not only basic VFL training and inference for a variety of models and settings but also efficiency enhancement techniques and multiple defense methods that mitigate potential threats. Moreover, we perform extensive experiments on combinations of the above settings using multiple datasets to provide different perspectives on VFL efficiency and safety. We believe \\verb|VFLAIR| and these benchmark results will provide researchers with useful tools and guidance for their future work. Our contributions are summarized in the following:\n\n\\textbf{(1).} We design \\verb+VFLAIR+, a lightweight and extensible VFL framework that aims to facilitate research development of VFL (see \\cref{fig:VFLAIR}). We design standardized pipelines for VFL training and validation, supporting $13$ datasets, $29$ different local model architectures including linear regression, tree and neural networks, $6$ different global models, $2$ model partition settings, $5$ communication protocols, $1$ encryption method, $11$ attacks and $8$ defense methods, each implemented as a distinct module and can be easily extended.\n\n\\textbf{(2).} We propose new evaluation metrics and modules, and perform extensive experiments to benchmark various perspectives of VFL, from which we draw key insights on VFL system design choice, in order to promote future development and practical deployment of VFL. % Performance of VFL models trained with standard VFL training, attack performance of $11$ attacks, defense capability of $8$ defense methods are evaluated under both aggVFL and splitVFL with communication protocol using both FedSGD and FedBCD.\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.89\\linewidth]{figures/VFLAIR_7_5.pdf}\n    \\caption{{An overview of the Components of VFLAIR.}} % After specifying the settings of VFL system, attacks and defense methods can be evaluated on top of the system.

FATE~\\citep{FATE,liu2021fate} is an industry-grade FL project which supports a variety of model architectures and secure computation protocols; Fedlearner~\\citep{Fedlearner} is specialized in advertising scenarios; PaddleFL~\\citep{PaddleFL} supports 2-party and 3-party VFL with MPC protection; Pysyft~\\citep{ryffel2018generic,romanini2021pyvertical} introduces PyVertical, which focus on SplitNN-type of VFL settings; FedTree~\\citep{fedtree2022} focuses on tree-based VFL only; FedML~\\citep{he2020fedml} supports basic training of VFL with logistic regression models. Real-world industrial applications have been witnessed in domains such as advertising~\\citep{cai2020Bytedance,tencent2021} and finance~\\citep{cheng2020federated,Cheng2022DigitalEra}. These works demonstrate the widespread interest and the practical significance of VFL. \nHowever, these works are often relatively heavy-weight as they are designed for industrial deployment. \nOn the other hand, most existing benchmarks on FL focus on HFL scenario~\\citep{chai2020fedeval,lai2022fedscale,zhang2023fedaudio}. For VFL, ~\\citep{kang2022framework} evaluates several defense strategies for data reconstruction attacks; SLPerf~\\citep{zhou2023slperf} focuses on benchmarking and comparing various kinds of splitNN scenarios like splitVFL. No existing work provides a comprehensive evaluation covering a variety of key aspects of VFL settings, including model performance, communication efficiency and robustness to attacks. Due to space limitation, %{\\color{red}{we only include previous works on VFL Framework and Benchmarks here}} but \n} \\tianyuan{No, at least currently, no.}\n\n\n\n\\section{VFL Framework}\n\nIn a typical VFL setting with $K$ parties, each party owns their local private feature $\\{X_{k}\\}_{k=1}^K$  and local model $\\{G_{k}\\}_{k=1}^K$ with parameters $\\{\\theta_{k}\\}_{k=1}^K$ respectively. Only one party controls the private label information $Y$ and is referred to as \\textit{active} party while other parties are referred to as \\textit{passive} parties.\nThe active party also controls a global trainable model parameterized by $\\varphi$ (splitVFL) or global non-trainable function $F$ (aggVFL) to aggregate each party's local model output. Note in tree-based VFL the global function is an aggregation function that identifies the optimal feature split based on feature splitting information received from all parties. %The classification task is also regarded as the main task since it is the purpose for the collaboration between parties and reflects the utility of the VFL model. \nWithout loss of generality, we assume that the $K^{th}$ party is the active party while other $K-1$ parties are passive parties.\nIn the collaborative training process of NN-based VFL, each party computes its local feature embedding $H_k=G_k(X_k,\\theta_k), k=1,\\dots,K$. The active party collects $\\{H_k\\}_{k=1}^K$ and gets the final prediction $\\hat{Y}=F(H_1,\\dots,H_K, \\varphi)$. %Based on whether $F$ is a trainable model or a non-trainable function, we follow~\\citep{liu2022vertical} to categorize VFL systems into splitVFL and aggVFL separately. \nThe loss $\\mathcal{L}=\\ell(Y,\\hat{Y})$ is calculated at the active party. The gradient w.r.s. to $H_k$ as $g_k = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial H_k}, k=1,\\dots,K$ are then calculated and transmitted back to each party by the active party. Using these gradients, each party performs local model updates by SGD using $\\nabla_{\\theta_k}\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\theta_k}=\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial H_k}\\frac{\\partial H_k}{\\partial \\theta_k}, k=1,\\dots,K$. Also the active party performs model update with SGD on global model $F$ if it is trainable using $\\nabla_{\\varphi}\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\varphi}$. In the inference procedure, the same is done but without the backward gradient descent to get the prediction of labels. If the exchange of $H_k$ and $g_k$ is performed each round, such VFL protocol is referred as FedSGD protocol. On the other hand, if communication is done every $Q>1$ steps of local updates, such protocol is referred to as FedBCD~\\citep{liu2022fedbcd}. %{\\color{red}{Also, communication protocols that quantifies $H_k$ (using only $2^{b}$ bits for each element), or sparsifies $H_k$ by preserving only Top-k useful elements (using only $0<r<1$ proportion of the total elements), before information transmission to reduce communication cost, are referred to as Quantize~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} and Top-k~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} respectively. Further, cached FedBCD communication protocol using different batches of data for local update steps are termed CELU-VFL~\\citep{fu2022towards}.}}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Overview of VFLAIR}\n\n\n\\textbf{Implemented Components.} An overview of the components of \\verb|VFLAIR| is shown in \\cref{fig:VFLAIR}.\n\\verb|VFLAIR| incorporates not only basic VFL training and testing process for both NN-based and tree-based VFL of various settings, but also multiple existing efficiency enhancement techniques, data leakage and model utility impairing attacks as well as defending methods that aim to mitigate potential threats. \\verb|VFLAIR| provides support for both aggVFL and splitVFL with easily adjustable model architectures. %For tree-based VFL, \\verb|VFLAIR| accommodates XGBoost and Random Forest for aggregation. \nCurrently, \\verb|VFLAIR| supports $5$ communication protocols %including FedSGD (vanilla protocol), FedBCD~\\citep{liu2022fedbcd}, CELU-VFL~\\citep{fu2022towards}, Quantize~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} and Top-k~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} \nto improve communication efficiency. Also, $11$ existing attacks and $8$ \ndefenses are supported. Moreover, \\verb|VFLAIR| supports the comprehensive assessment of defense performance using carefully designed metrics (see \\cref{sec:metrics_definition}), based on which defense strategy recommendations can be provided. Paillier Encryption~\\citep{cheng2021secureboost} is also supported to further protect transmitted results.\nIn total, $13$ datasets from  a diverse range of industrial domains, including but not limited to medical, financial, and recommendation\nare supported.\n\n\\textbf{How to use and extend.} \\verb|VFLAIR| is a light-weight and comprehensive VFL framework that can be launched on a single GPU or CPU (see \\cref{tab:hardware} for its system requirement compared to FATE). \\verb|VFLAIR| facilitates the easy integration of different datasets for model training and inference through simple dataset loading and partitioning functions. New attacks and defenses can be quickly incorporated into the framework thanks to the modular structure.  % VFL model utility and its susceptibility to attacks under various defense strategies by using $5$ carefully designed evaluation metrics. Furthermore,\n\n\n\n\\section{VFL Benchmark}\n\n\n\\subsection{VFL Settings, Models and Datasets} \nUsing \\verb|VFLAIR|, We benchmark the VFL main task performance using $13$ datasets including MNIST~\\citep{MNISTdataset}, CIFAR10~\\citep{krizhevsky2009learning}, CIFAR100~\\citep{krizhevsky2009learning}, NUSWIDE~\\citep{NUSWIDEdataset}, Breast Cancer~\\citep{street1993nuclear}, Diabetes~\\citep{Diabetes1999dataset}, Adult Income~\\citep{AdultIncome1996dataset}, Criteo~\\citep{guo2017deepfm_Criteo}, Avazu~\\citep{qu2018product_Avazu}, Cora~\\citep{mccallum2000automating_Cora}, News20~\\citep{lang1995News20},Credit~\\citep{Dua:2019} and Nursery~\\citep{Dua:2019}.\n\nWe explore $2$ distinct architectures, namely aggVFL and splitVFL, and comprehensively benchmark their performance. For global model $F$, a global softmax function is applied under aggVFL setting while a 1-layer fully-connected model serves as the global model for splitVFL setting (except for Cora dataset, for which a 1-layer graph convolution layer is applied). \nAdditionally, we investigate the impact of different communication protocols by comparing FedBCD~\\citep{liu2022fedbcd} ($Q=5$) and CELU-VFL~\\citep{fu2022towards} ($Q=5,W=5$), as well as compression mechanisms Quantize ($b=16$)~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} and Top-k ($r=0.9$)~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} to the conventional FedSGD, as discussed in \\cref{sec:vfl_setting} and further provide insights into the communication cost reduction achieved by communication efficient protocols,\nas well as the impact of FedBCD when various attacks and defenses are deployed. % demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing efficiency.\nWe also evaluate the impact of the number of participating parties as well as the type of local model (logistic regression, tree, NN) on the main task performance of VFL. For tee-based VFL, we further benchmark both Random Forrest and XGBoost algorithms. Moreover, for \ntree-based VFL, we employ Paillier Encryption~\\citep{cheng2021secureboost} to protect transmitted information and measure its impact on computation efficiency. %such as labels and gradients. {\\color{red}{We measure the execution time along side the model performance across various tree-based VFL aggregation algorithms with and without the application of Paillier Encryption, shedding light on the execution overhead incurred by encryption.}} \n\n\n\\subsection{Attacks and Defenses} \\label{subsec:attacks}\n \n\\begin{table}[!tb]\n\\caption{Summary of attacks for NN-based VFL}\n\\label{tab:attacks}\n\\resizebox{0.998\\linewidth}{!}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c}\n    \\toprule\n    Attack Type & Attack & \\shortstack{Requirements\\\\/ Limitations} & \\shortstack{Attacker\\\\Party} & Attack Performance (AP) \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    \\multirow{7}{*}{\\shortstack{Label\\\\Inference\\\\(LI)}} & \\shortstack{Norm-based Scoring (NS)~\\citep{li2022label}} & \\multirow{2}{*}{\\shortstack{binary classification,\\\\sample-level}} & \\multirow{7}{*}{passive} & \\multirow{2}{*}{\\shortstack{AUC of\\\\inferred labels}}\\\\\n    \\cline{2-2}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n     & \\shortstack{Direction-based Scoring (DS)~\\citep{li2022label}} &  &  & \\\\\n    \\cline{2-3}\n    \\cline{5-5}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n     & \\shortstack{Direct Label Inference (DLI)~\\citep{li2022label,zou2022defending}} & sample-level &  & \\multirow{5}{*}{\\shortstack{ratio of correctly\\\\inferred labels\\\\ \\,}}\\\\\n    \\cline{2-3}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    & Batch-level Label Inference (BLI)~\\citep{zou2022defending} & - &  & \\\\\n    \\cline{2-3}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    & Passive Model Completion (PMC)~\\citep{fu2021label} & \\multirow{2}{*}{\\shortstack{auxiliary labeled\\\\data for each class}} &  & \\\\\n    \\cline{2-2}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    & Active Model Completion (AMC)~\\citep{fu2021label} &  &  & \\\\\n    \\cline{1-5}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    \n    \n    \\multirow{3}{*}{\\shortstack{Feature\\\\Reconstruction\\\\(FR)}} & \\shortstack{Generative Regression Network (GRN)~\\citep{luo2021feature}} & \\shortstack{black-box} & \\multirow{3}{*}{\\shortstack{active}} & \\multirow{3}{*}{\\shortstack{$1-\\text{MSE}(U_0,U_{rec})$ }}\\\\\n    \\cline{2-3}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n     & \\shortstack{Training-based Back Mapping by\\\\model inversion (TBM)~\\citep{li2022ressfl}} & \\shortstack{white-box,\\\\auxiliary i.i.d. data} &  & \\\\\n    \\cline{1-5}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    \\shortstack{Targeted\\\\Backdoor (TB)\\\\ \\,} & \\shortstack{Label Replacement\\\\Backdoor (LRB)~\\citep{zou2022defending}} & \\shortstack{$\\geq1$ sample of\\\\target class} & \\shortstack{passive\\\\ \\,\\\\ \\,} & \\shortstack{ratio of triggered samples\\\\inferred as target class}\\\\\n    \\cline{1-5}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    \\multirow{2}{*}{\\shortstack{Non-targeted\\\\Backdoor (NTB)}} & Noisy-sample Backdoor (NSB)~\\citep{zou2023mutual} & - & \\multirow{2}{*}{passive} & \\multirow{2}{*}{\\shortstack{MP difference between total\\\\and noisy/missing samples}}\\\\\n    \\cline{2-3}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n     & Missing Feature (MF)~\\citep{liu2021rvfr} & - &  & \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n}\n\\end{table}\n\nWe benchmark the performance of $11$ attacks with $8$ defenses on $3$ datasets including MNIST~\\citep{MNISTdataset}, CIFAR10~\\citep{krizhevsky2009learning} and NUSWIDE~\\citep{NUSWIDEdataset}.\nFor these evaluations, we mainly consider a VFL setting with $1$ active party and $1$ passive party following original works~\\citep{li2022label,luo2021feature,li2022ressfl}, denoted as party $a,p$ respectively, with each party owning their local feature $X_a, X_p$ and local model $G_a, G_p$.\nThe local model output of the active and passive party are denoted as $H_a, H_p$ respectively.\nWe summarized the evaluated attacks in \\cref{tab:attacks}.

Execution Time (Exec.Time) is used to measure computation efficiency. \n\n\\textbf{Attack Performance (AP).} %As we also include various kinds of attacks and defense in our platform and benchmark experiments, we define AP so as to evaluate the success rate of a given attack which also reflects the vulnerability of a VFL system to that given attack. \nThe definition of AP varies with respect to the type of the attack and is summarized in \\cref{tab:attacks}. \n\n\\textbf{Defense Capability Score (DCS).} %To evaluate the defense methods, \nIntuitively, an ideal defense should not compromise the utility of the original main task and should thwart the attack completely. Therefore, considering that both AP and MP are key metrics to evaluate defenses. We further propose \\textbf{Defense Capability Score (DCS)}, to directly compare all the defenses under one unified metric. Let $df=(\\text{AP},\\text{MP})$ represents the performance of a defense on an AP-MP graph, then we define its defense capability score (DCS) based on the distance between $df$ to an ideal defense $df^{*}=(\\text{AP}^{*}, \\text{MP}^{*})$.  MP$^{*}$ is the MP of VFL without defense and AP$^{*}$ is set to $0.0$ representing the performance of a completely incapable attacker.

In other words, if \na defense mechanism is designed for mitigating label inference attacks only, we do not assess its effectiveness against FR attacks or backdoor attacks. \n\nWe further rank all the defenses of different hyper-parameters based on their C-DCS. Due to space limitation, we show representative results for NUSWIDE dataset in \\cref{tab:tiny_nuswide_dcs_ranking}.%Consequently, our experimental evaluations do not include assessments of GPer, CAE, and DCAE against FR attacks and NTB attacks, while GS is excluded from evaluations involving FR attacks.}}\n\n\n\\textbf{Attacks pose great threat to VFL.} Comparing the black squares illustrating the MP and AP of the attack against a VFL system without any defense in the sub-figures, we can observe that DS, DLI, BLI and TBM attacks are strong attacks with AP higher than $0.97$, while MF attacks are quite weak with AP below $0.1$.\n\n\\textbf{Defenses exhibit trade-offs between MP and AP.} For most of the attacks and defenses, we can observe an apparent trade-off between MP and AP, i.e. a lower AP is often gained with increasing harm of MP as defense strength grows, which can be controlled by adjusting defense hyper-parameters. \nAn increase of noise level in DP-G and DP-L, sparsification rate in GS, regularization hyper-parameter $\\alpha_d$ in dCor, confusional strength $\\lambda_2$ in CAE and DCAE, regularization hyper-parameter $\\lambda$ in MID or a decrease of DP budget $\\epsilon$ in GPer will lead to lower MP and AP.\n\n\\textbf{DCS rankings are consistent across various datasets and settings.} As shown in \\cref{tab:mnist_dcs_ranking,tab:nuswide_dcs_ranking,tab:cifar10_dcs_ranking}, the results of the C-DCS rankings are generally consistent across all $3$ datasets. %% namely MNIST, CIAFR10 and NUSWIDE, under the same aggVFL setting with FedSGD communication. Also, \nAs summarised in \\cref{fig:dcs_ranking_mean_std}, these results demonstrate the robustness of the proposed DCS metrics, as well as the stableness of relative performance of different defense methods.Note that, T-DCS$_{\\text{FR}}$ values are much lower than the T-DCS of other types, indicating that FR attacks are harder to defend than other attacks, which are consistent with human observation (see \\cref{fig:visualization_mnist_tbm} in \\cref{subsec:visualization_tbm}). %and more effective defense methods against FR attacks are in need.\n\n\\textbf{MID, L-DP and G-DP are effective on a wide spectrum of attacks.} MID demonstrates its capability of achieving a relatively lower AP while maintaining a higher MP compared to most other defenses as shown in \\cref{fig:mnist_MPAP,fig:nuswide_MPAP,fig:cifar10_MPAP} and  \\cref{tab:mnist_dcs_ranking,tab:nuswide_dcs_ranking,tab:cifar10_dcs_ranking}; L-DP and G-DP are also generally effective under most attacks with above average T-DCS and C-DCS; DCAE is effective in defending against LI attacks; %\\textbf{CAE is effective only against LI attacks that utilize merely the information of the current sample}%\\textbf{CAE consistently performs well across when defending against LI attacks that utilize merely the information of the current sample} by disguising label directly; \nGS demonstrates strong defense ability for most of the LI attacks but performs less than satisfactory on LRB attacks; GPer performs similar to DP-G and DP-L in defending against label related attacks; %as it targets at defending LI attacks and guarantees label-DP \\yang{what about other attac}ks?} \\tianyuan{Not evaluated...

Here we use $\\beta =0.5$ for our main results. %If the user wants to place more attention on maintaining a high MP, hyper-parameter $\\beta$ in \\cref{eq:dcs} can be adjusted to a value larger than $0.5$. \n\\cref{fig:change_beta_dcs_mnist,fig:change_beta_dcs_cifar10,fig:change_beta_dcs_nuswide} show the change of the ranking results with the change of $\\beta$. Overall the relative rankings are not significantly impacted by $\\beta$, demonstrating the stableness of the comparison results among various defenses. As $\\beta$ grows to large values, e.g. $\\geq 0.9$, the metric places overly strong weight on MP, resulting in more variations on the rankings. Specifically, dCor ranks higher with the increase of $\\beta$ thanks to its better MP preservation at the cost of a weaker AP limitation.\n\\begin{table}[!tb]\n\\caption{T-DCS and C-DCS for All Defenses [NUSWIDE dataset, aggVFL, FedSGD]}\n\\label{tab:tiny_nuswide_dcs_ranking}\n\\resizebox{0.998\\linewidth}{!}{\n  \\centering\n   \\begin{tabular}{cc|cccccc|c}\n    \\toprule\n    \\textbf{\\makecell{Defense\\\\Name}} & \\textbf{\\makecell{Defense\\\\Parameter}} & \\bm{$T\\text{-}DCS_{LI_{2}}$} &\n    \\bm{$T\\text{-}DCS_{LI_{5}}$} & \\bm{$T\\text{-}DCS_{LI}$} & \\bm{$T\\text{-}DCS_{FR}$} & \\bm{$T\\text{-}DCS_{TB}$} & \\bm{$T\\text{-}DCS_{NTB}$} & \\bm{$C\\text{-}DCS$} \\\\ \n    \\midrule \n    MID  & 10000  & 0.7358 & 0.8559 & \\textbf{0.8159} & 0.5833 & \\textbf{0.7333} & 0.8707 & 0.7508  \\\\\n    MID  & 1.0    & 0.7476 & 0.8472 & 0.8140 & 0.5833 & 0.7331 & 0.8700 & 0.7501  \\\\\n    MID  & 100    & 0.7320 & 0.8536 & 0.8130 & 0.5833 & 0.7326 & \\textbf{0.8711} & 0.7500  \\\\\n    G-DP & 0.1    & 0.7375 & 0.8262 & 0.7966 & 0.5863 & 0.7282 & 0.8675 & 0.7447  \\\\\n    L-DP & 0.1    & 0.7389 & 0.8177 & 0.7915 & 0.5863 & 0.7258 & 0.8603 & 0.7410  \\\\\n    MID  & 0.1    & 0.7516 & 0.8259 & 0.8011 & 0.5833 & 0.7172 & 0.8563 & 0.7395  \\\\\n    MID  & 0.01   & 0.7280 & 0.8092 & 0.7822 & 0.5844 & 0.7151 & 0.8627 & 0.7361  \\\\\n    dCor & 0.3    & \\textbf{0.7641} & 0.8411 & 0.8155 & 0.5834 & 0.7289 & 0.8051 & 0.7332  \\\\\n    dCor & 0.0001 & 0.6496 & 0.6340 & 0.6392 & \\textbf{0.5864} & 0.6307 & 0.8287 & 0.6712 \\\\\n    \\hline\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    GS   & 99.0   & 0.7404 & 0.8060 & 0.7841 & -      & 0.6415 & 0.8408 & -      \\\\\n    CAE  & 1.0    & 0.6863 & 0.7822 & 0.7502 & -      & 0.6830  & -           \\\\\n    DCAE & 0.0    & 0.6669 & \\textbf{0.8660} & 0.7996 & -      & 0.6816 & -      & -       \\\\\n    GPer & 0.01   & 0.7386 & 0.8412 & 0.8070 & -      & 0.7193 & -      & -       \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n}\n\\end{table}\n\\textbf{splitVFL is less vulnerable to attacks than aggVFL.}\nUsing DCS metrics, we directly compare all the aforementioned attacks and defenses under aggVFL and splitVFL settings to understand the impact of changing the model partition strategy on VFL's vulnerability against attacks.

In addition, a system with FedBCD also has an overall positive effect on boosting defense performance against FR and NTB attacks. This is evidenced by the fact that that the majority of DCS gaps are positive for FR and NTB attacks as shown in \\cref{fig:mnist_FedBCD_DCS_hist}.\nSimilar conclusions can be drawn from \\cref{fig:nuswide_FedBCD_hist,fig:nuswide_FedBCD_DCS_gap}.\n\n\n\\section{Conclusions and Limitations}\n\n\nIn this work, we introduce a light-weight VFL framework \\verb|VFLAIR| that implements basic VFL training and evaluation flow under multiple model partition, model architectures,communication protocols and attacks and defenses algorithms using datasets of different modality. We also introduce unified evaluation metrics and benchmark model utility, communication and computation efficiency, and defense performance under various VFL settings, which sheds lights on choosing partition, communication and defense techniques in practical deployment. \nCurrently, the library has limited implementations on cryptographic techniques. Combination of non-cryptograhic and cryptographic techniques would be an interesting next step and we plan to add more advanced privacy-preserving and communication-efficient methods to our library. %encryption implementation, since is not implemented for NN-based VFL, we will add this part in the near future.}}\n\n\n\n\\section{Reproducibility Statement}\n\n Our code is also available at\n\n\n\n\n", "decision": "Accept", "review": [{"id": "kzw0g8RJd1", "rating": 8, "content": {"summary": "The paper presents a research library and benchmark named VFLAIR for vertical federated learning.

For example, it would be beneficial to describe the core classes, interfaces, and data structures that facilitate the integration of new models, attacks, and defenses. Without this, the claim of being lightweight and extensible remains unsubstantiated.\n\n2. The insights in Section 6 should be highlighted. Currently, the paragraph is too long (especially Section 6.2) and readers are hard to find interesting results from the experiments. I suggest the authors put the insights at the beginning of each subsection. The current presentation buries key findings within dense paragraphs, making it difficult for readers to quickly grasp the significance of the experimental results. For instance, in Section 6.2, the discussion of attack and defense performance could be improved by explicitly stating the main takeaways at the start of each paragraph, followed by supporting details.\n\n3. It seems that the paper divides the datasets into multiple subsets equally. Non-IID data partitioning is an important factor in FL and would be good to be included in VFLAIR. Also, it\u2019d be better to include real-world vertical federated datasets besides partitioning a centralized dataset. The lack of non-IID data partitioning limits the practical relevance of the benchmark. Real-world federated learning scenarios often involve data heterogeneity, and the current benchmark does not adequately address this. Furthermore, while partitioning centralized datasets is a starting point, the inclusion of truly distributed real-world datasets would significantly enhance the benchmark's value. For example, datasets from different hospitals or financial institutions would better reflect real-world challenges.\n\n4. The communication protocols in the library are not rich. Only two methods are considered. The limited number of communication protocols restricts the benchmark's ability to evaluate the communication efficiency of different VFL methods. The inclusion of more advanced protocols, such as those employing compression or quantization techniques, would be beneficial.", "suggestions": "To address the lack of clarity regarding VFLAIR's architecture, the authors should include a detailed diagram illustrating the framework's modular design. This diagram should clearly show the relationships between different components, such as the data loading module, model training module, attack and defense modules, and communication protocols. Furthermore, the paper should provide a step-by-step guide on how to add new components to the framework. This guide should include code examples and explanations of the key interfaces and classes that need to be implemented. For example, the authors could demonstrate how to add a new attack by inheriting from a base attacker class and implementing the necessary methods. This would make the framework more accessible and easier to extend, supporting the claims of being lightweight and extensible.\n\nTo improve the presentation of experimental results, the authors should restructure Section 6 to highlight key findings at the beginning of each subsection. Each subsection should start with a concise summary of the main insights, followed by the detailed experimental results and analysis. For example, in Section 6.2, the authors could begin by stating that \"Our experiments show that attack X is most effective against defense Y,\" and then provide the supporting experimental data. This approach would make it easier for readers to quickly grasp the significance of the results and would improve the overall readability of the paper. Additionally, the authors should consider using tables or figures to present the experimental results more clearly, rather than relying solely on dense paragraphs of text.\n\nTo enhance the benchmark's practical relevance, the authors should include non-IID data partitioning methods. This could involve partitioning datasets based on different criteria, such as feature distribution or class imbalance. For example, the authors could simulate scenarios where different parties have access to different subsets of features or where the data is not uniformly distributed across classes. Furthermore, the authors should explore the inclusion of real-world vertical federated datasets, such as those from healthcare or finance. This would make the benchmark more representative of real-world challenges and would enable researchers to evaluate the performance of VFL methods under more realistic conditions. The authors could also consider providing tools or scripts to facilitate the generation of non-IID data partitions, making it easier for researchers to experiment with different scenarios."}}, {"id": "p1x3Mj4799", "rating": 3, "content": {"summary": "This paper proposed a benchmarking framework for vertical federated learning.

The title should be more reflective of the paper's actual content, which is heavily skewed towards security aspects rather than a holistic view of VFL. To address this, the authors should consider either narrowing the title to reflect the security focus or expanding the scope of the paper to include a more comprehensive treatment of VFL, encompassing aspects like model performance under various data distributions, communication efficiency, and computational overhead beyond just attack and defense scenarios. The current title creates an expectation that is not fully met by the content, leading to a disconnect between the stated goals and the actual contributions.\n\nFurthermore, the introduction of the Defense Capability Score (DCS) is promising, but the paper fails to provide sufficient empirical validation of its effectiveness. The authors need to demonstrate that the DCS metric is not only theoretically sound but also practically meaningful. This could be achieved by showing that DCS scores correlate with other established metrics or by conducting experiments that explicitly test the robustness, sensitivity, and alignment with human intuition of the DCS. For example, the authors could demonstrate that a higher DCS score consistently corresponds to a defense mechanism that is more resistant to a wider range of attacks or that the DCS score is sensitive to changes in defense parameters. Without such validation, the DCS remains a theoretical construct without demonstrated practical value. The experiments should also explore the behavior of DCS under various attack scenarios, model architectures, and data distributions to ensure its general applicability.\n\nFinally, the paper needs a more detailed explanation of the VFLAIR workflow and a more structured presentation of the evaluation results. The current description of the workflow is too high-level, making it difficult to understand how the different components interact and how the benchmarking process is facilitated. A clear, step-by-step explanation of the training and evaluation flow, including the specific implementation details of the model partition, communication protocols, and attack and defense algorithms, is crucial. The evaluation section should be reorganized to systematically present the results based on these key factors. For example, the results could be presented in a tabular format, with clear headings and subheadings that categorize the results based on model partition strategies, communication protocols, and attack and defense algorithms. This would make it easier for the reader to understand the results and draw meaningful conclusions.

Firstly, the platform needs to incorporate more advanced model partitioning and communication protocols. For model partitioning, techniques such as adaptive partitioning based on feature importance or gradient magnitude should be explored. This would allow for more efficient distribution of the model across different parties. For communication protocols, the platform should include methods like knowledge distillation, which allows for transferring knowledge from one party to another without sharing raw data, or gradient compression techniques like sparsification or quantization to reduce the amount of data exchanged during training.

The authors aim to address the gap between academic research and industrial applications by providing a lightweight, modular, and extensible platform. VFLAIR supports a wide range of VFL algorithms, including various model architectures (linear regression, tree-based models, and neural networks), communication protocols (FedSGD, FedBCD, CELU-VFL, Top-k, and Quantize), and defense methods against data inference and backdoor attacks. The framework is designed to facilitate research by providing a standardized pipeline for VFL training and validation. A key contribution of this work is the extensive benchmarking of 11 different attacks and 8 defense strategies under diverse settings, which the authors use to derive insights and recommendations for practical VFL deployment. The empirical evaluation includes experiments on 13 datasets, assessing the impact of different model partition strategies, communication protocols, and defense mechanisms on model performance, communication efficiency, and robustness to attacks. The authors also introduce new evaluation metrics, such as Attack Performance (AP), Main Task Performance (MP), and Defense Capability Score (DCS), to quantify the effectiveness of different VFL configurations. The paper's findings highlight the trade-offs between model utility and security in VFL systems and provide practical guidance for selecting appropriate defense strategies. Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the VFL research community by providing a comprehensive framework and benchmark for evaluating the performance and security of VFL systems. However, as I will discuss in the weaknesses section, there are some areas where the paper could be improved to further enhance its impact and utility.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nI find several aspects of this paper to be particularly strong. First, the development of VFLAIR as a lightweight, modular, and extensible framework is a significant contribution. The authors have clearly identified a need for a research-focused VFL platform that bridges the gap between academic research and industrial applications. By providing a standardized pipeline for VFL training and validation, VFLAIR has the potential to accelerate research in this area. The framework's support for a wide range of VFL algorithms, including various model architectures, communication protocols, and defense methods, makes it a versatile tool for researchers. Second, the extensive benchmarking of 11 attacks and 8 defenses under diverse settings is a valuable contribution. The authors have conducted a thorough evaluation of the performance and robustness of different VFL configurations, providing practical insights into the trade-offs between model utility and security. The use of multiple datasets and the exploration of different model partition strategies further enhance the generalizability of the findings. The introduction of new evaluation metrics, such as AP, MP, and DCS, is also a positive aspect, as these metrics provide a standardized way to quantify the effectiveness of different VFL configurations. Finally, the paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear explanations of the methods and experimental results. The authors have made a commendable effort to make the paper accessible to a broad audience, which will undoubtedly increase its impact on the VFL research community. The inclusion of a comprehensive appendix further enhances the paper's value, providing additional details and context for the readers.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant further discussion. First, while the paper introduces VFLAIR as a lightweight and modular framework, it lacks a direct comparison with existing VFL frameworks, such as FATE. Although the introduction mentions that mainstream VFL projects like FATE are industrial-grade and not designed for keeping up with research advances, a quantitative comparison of system characteristics, such as system requirements, execution time, and resource usage, would be beneficial. This comparison would help potential users understand the trade-offs between VFLAIR and other frameworks and would further justify the need for a new framework. The absence of such a comparison makes it difficult to assess the practical advantages of VFLAIR over existing solutions. Second, the paper's evaluation of defense methods lacks a comprehensive analysis of their applicability to different attack types. While the paper benchmarks 11 attacks and 8 defenses, it does not explicitly state which defenses are applicable to which attacks in the main text, although this information is available in Table 1. This lack of clarity makes it difficult to understand the effectiveness of each defense method against specific attacks. For example, it is not immediately clear whether a defense designed for label inference attacks would be effective against feature reconstruction attacks. This is a crucial point for researchers who want to use VFLAIR to evaluate specific defense strategies. Third, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead associated with the implemented defense methods. While the paper reports the execution time for tree-based models with and without encryption, it does not provide a similar analysis for the other defense methods. This is a significant limitation, as the computational cost of defense methods is a critical factor in practical VFL deployments. Researchers need to know the computational overhead of each defense method to make informed decisions about which methods to use in their specific contexts. Fourth, the paper's experimental evaluation is limited to a specific set of datasets and model architectures. While the paper includes experiments on 13 datasets and various model architectures, it does not explicitly test the framework's performance with larger models, such as ResNet or Inception, which are commonly used in computer vision tasks. This is a limitation, as the performance and scalability of VFL frameworks can vary significantly depending on the model architecture. The paper also does not include experiments on datasets with highly imbalanced classes or high-dimensional sparse features, which are common in real-world applications. This limits the generalizability of the findings and raises questions about the framework's robustness in diverse scenarios. Fifth, the paper does not address the issue of fairness in VFL. While the paper focuses on privacy and security, fairness is another critical aspect of VFL that needs to be considered. The paper does not include any discussion of fairness-related metrics or defense methods, which is a significant limitation, especially given the increasing awareness of fairness issues in machine learning. Finally, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the scalability of VFLAIR with an increasing number of participants. While the paper includes experiments with 2 and 4 parties, it does not explicitly test the framework's performance with a significantly larger number of participants. This is a limitation, as scalability is a crucial factor in practical VFL deployments. The paper also does not discuss the potential challenges of deploying VFLAIR in real-world scenarios, such as network latency, data heterogeneity, and the need for secure multi-party computation. These issues need to be addressed to make VFLAIR a more practical and useful tool for researchers and practitioners.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nBased on the identified weaknesses, I recommend several improvements to enhance the paper's impact and utility. First, I suggest that the authors include a direct comparison of VFLAIR with existing VFL frameworks, such as FATE. This comparison should include quantitative metrics, such as system requirements, execution time, and resource usage, to provide a clear understanding of the trade-offs between VFLAIR and other frameworks. This would help potential users make informed decisions about which framework to use for their specific needs. Second, I recommend that the authors provide a more detailed analysis of the applicability of each defense method to different attack types. This analysis should be included in the main text, not just in the appendix or tables, and should clearly state which defenses are effective against which attacks. This would help researchers quickly identify the most appropriate defense methods for their specific concerns. Third, I suggest that the authors include a detailed analysis of the computational overhead associated with each defense method. This analysis should include metrics such as training time, communication cost, and memory usage. This would help researchers understand the practical implications of using different defense methods and make informed decisions about which methods to use in their specific contexts. Fourth, I recommend that the authors expand the experimental evaluation to include a wider range of datasets and model architectures. This should include experiments with larger models, such as ResNet or Inception, as well as datasets with highly imbalanced classes or high-dimensional sparse features. This would enhance the generalizability of the findings and demonstrate the robustness of VFLAIR in diverse scenarios. Fifth, I suggest that the authors incorporate fairness-related metrics and defense methods into VFLAIR. This would make the framework more comprehensive and address an important aspect of VFL that is currently missing. This could include metrics such as demographic parity, equal opportunity, and predictive parity, as well as defense methods that aim to mitigate bias in VFL models. Sixth, I recommend that the authors conduct more extensive experiments to evaluate the scalability of VFLAIR with an increasing number of participants. This should include experiments with a significantly larger number of parties to assess the framework's performance in more realistic scenarios. Finally, I suggest that the authors discuss the potential challenges of deploying VFLAIR in real-world scenarios, such as network latency, data heterogeneity, and the need for secure multi-party computation. This would make the paper more relevant to practitioners and would help bridge the gap between academic research and industrial applications.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe would be beneficial for the authors to address. First, given the focus on label inference attacks, I am curious about the specific scenarios where the other attack types (feature reconstruction, backdoor, and non-targeted attacks) are most relevant. What are the practical situations in which these attacks would be a primary concern, and how do the defense methods perform in those specific contexts? Second, regarding the computational overhead of the defense methods, what are the specific bottlenecks that contribute to the increased execution time? Are there any optimization techniques that could be used to reduce the computational cost of these methods? Third, concerning the scalability of VFLAIR, what are the main challenges in deploying the framework with a large number of participants? Are there any specific architectural limitations that need to be addressed to improve scalability? Fourth, given the lack of explicit fairness considerations, what are the authors' plans for incorporating fairness-related metrics and defense methods into VFLAIR? Are there any specific fairness challenges in VFL that the authors are particularly interested in addressing? Fifth, regarding the choice of datasets, what are the authors' criteria for selecting the datasets used in the experiments? Are there any specific characteristics of the datasets that make them representative of real-world VFL scenarios? Finally, given the focus on benchmarking, what are the authors' plans for maintaining and updating the benchmark results? How will they ensure that the benchmark remains relevant and up-to-date with the latest advancements in VFL research?\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n6.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.75\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nAccept\n}", "pred_standard_mode": "I will use Standard Mode for comprehensive thinking.

While the authors mention modularity, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how each component is implemented and how they interact within the framework. For instance, the specific data preprocessing steps for each dataset, the exact model architectures used (beyond just mentioning 'logistic regression, tree, NN'), and the detailed algorithmic steps for each defense method are not elaborated upon. This makes it difficult to understand the practical implementation of the framework and to reproduce the results.\n2.\tThe results of the VFL benchmark are presented in the form of bar charts and tables, but the authors do not provide a detailed analysis and discussion of these results.

For example, the paper does not explore the underlying reasons for the observed trade-offs between main task performance and attack performance for different defense methods. A more in-depth analysis of the results, including the impact of different hyperparameters and the limitations of the proposed evaluation metric, would enhance the quality of the paper.\n3.\tThe authors introduce a new evaluation metric, DCS, but do not compare it with other existing evaluation metrics. While the authors argue that there are no directly applicable evaluation metrics for the specific problem of evaluating defense methods against various attacks in VFL, they do not provide a thorough justification for why a comparison with related metrics from broader fields like privacy or security is not relevant. Furthermore, the paper does not include a detailed analysis of the limitations of the DCS metric, such as its sensitivity to the choice of weighting parameters or its potential biases towards certain types of attacks or defenses.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo improve the paper, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the implementation of various components within the VFL framework. This should include a description of the data preprocessing steps for each dataset, the specific model architectures used (including the number of layers, activation functions, and hyperparameters), and the detailed algorithmic steps for each defense method. For example, when discussing the implementation of a specific defense method, the authors should provide the exact mathematical formulation and the step-by-step procedure for integrating it into the VFL training process. This would greatly enhance the reproducibility of the results and allow other researchers to build upon the proposed framework. Furthermore, the authors should include a detailed discussion of the design choices made during the implementation, such as the rationale behind selecting specific model architectures or defense methods for each dataset. This would provide valuable insights into the practical considerations of applying VFL in different scenarios.\n\nIn addition to providing more implementation details, the authors should also conduct a more in-depth analysis of the benchmark results. This should include a detailed discussion of the observed trade-offs between main task performance and attack performance for different defense methods. For example, the authors could investigate why certain defense methods are more effective against specific types of attacks and why some methods lead to a significant drop in main task performance. This analysis should also explore the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance of defense methods and the limitations of the proposed DCS metric. The authors should also consider including a sensitivity analysis of the DCS metric to the choice of weighting parameters and discuss its potential biases towards certain types of attacks or defenses. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed evaluation metric and its applicability in different scenarios.\n\nFinally, the authors should provide a more thorough justification for the introduction of the DCS metric and its comparison with existing evaluation metrics from related fields. While it is understandable that there may not be directly applicable evaluation metrics for the specific problem of evaluating defense methods against various attacks in VFL, the authors should explore the possibility of adapting existing metrics from broader fields like privacy or security. For example, metrics such as membership inference attack success rate or differential privacy guarantees could be considered as baselines for comparison. The authors should also discuss the limitations of the DCS metric in detail, including its sensitivity to the choice of weighting parameters and its potential biases towards certain types of attacks or defenses. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed evaluation metric and its applicability in different scenarios.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.\tThe authors only provide an overview of the workflow in the method section, without detailing the specific implementation of various components within the framework, such as datasets, models, and defense methods.\n2.\tThe results of the VFL benchmark are presented in the form of bar charts and tables, but the authors do not provide a detailed analysis and discussion of these results.\n3.\tThe authors introduce a new evaluation metric, DCS, but do not compare it with other existing evaluation metrics.\n\n### Rating\n\n3: reject, not good enough\n\n### Confidence\n\n4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain.

It would be helpful to address the ethical considerations related to data privacy, security, and fairness in the context of VFL.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would significantly benefit from a more detailed comparison with existing VFL frameworks. While the authors mention several frameworks like FATE, Fedlearner, PaddleFL, Pysygt, FedTree, and FedML, a deeper analysis is needed to understand VFLAIR's unique contributions. The comparison should not only focus on the features supported but also on the implementation details, performance characteristics, and ease of use. For example, a table comparing the supported model architectures, communication protocols, and defense mechanisms, along with their specific implementations in each framework, would be highly valuable. Furthermore, the comparison should include quantitative metrics such as training time, communication overhead, and memory usage for different scenarios. This would allow readers to assess the practical advantages and disadvantages of VFLAIR compared to existing solutions and understand the specific niche it aims to fill. The authors should also discuss the trade-offs made in VFLAIR's design, such as the choice of specific algorithms or the level of abstraction, and how these choices impact its performance and applicability.\n\nIn addition to a more detailed comparison, the paper should also include a thorough discussion of the limitations of VFLAIR and potential future research directions. The authors should acknowledge the specific scenarios where VFLAIR might not be the most suitable solution, such as very large-scale federated learning settings or specific types of data distributions. They should also discuss the potential challenges in extending VFLAIR to support new models, datasets, or defense mechanisms. Furthermore, the authors should outline specific research directions that could address these limitations, such as exploring more efficient communication protocols, developing more robust defense mechanisms, or improving the scalability of the framework. This discussion should also include potential ethical implications of VFL and the proposed framework. The authors should address the ethical considerations related to data privacy, security, and fairness in the context of VFL. This discussion should include potential risks of data leakage, bias in the models, and the potential for misuse of the framework. The authors should also discuss how VFLAIR can be used to mitigate these risks and promote responsible use of VFL.\n\nFinally, the paper needs a more detailed analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of VFLAIR. The authors should provide a theoretical analysis of the computational cost of the framework, considering the number of participants, the size of the datasets, and the complexity of the models. They should also provide empirical results demonstrating the scalability of VFLAIR, showing how the training time and communication overhead vary with the number of participants and the size of the datasets. This analysis should include a discussion of the bottlenecks in the framework and potential strategies for improving its scalability. For example, the authors could explore techniques such as model compression, distributed training, or asynchronous communication to reduce the computational cost and communication overhead. This analysis is crucial for understanding the practical applicability of VFLAIR in real-world scenarios and for guiding future research in this area.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

The paper provides a comprehensive benchmark for VFL, including 11 attacks and 8 defenses, which is a valuable contribution to the field.\n2. The paper evaluates the performance of various VFL models under different communication and model partition settings, providing insights into the trade-offs between model accuracy and communication efficiency.\n3. The paper provides recommendations on the choice of defense strategies for different practical VFL deployment scenarios, which can help practitioners to choose the most appropriate defense strategy for their specific needs.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper only considers 11 attacks and 8 defenses, which may not be representative of all possible attacks and defenses in VFL. The selection criteria for these specific attacks and defenses are not clearly justified, raising concerns about the generalizability of the benchmark. It's unclear if the chosen attacks represent the most potent threats or if the defenses are the most effective against those specific attacks. A more systematic approach to selecting a diverse and representative set of attacks and defenses is needed.\n2. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the different attacks and defenses. This is an important consideration for practical deployment, as some attacks or defenses may be too computationally expensive to be feasible in real-world scenarios. The lack of analysis on the time and resource requirements for each method makes it difficult to assess their practical applicability. For example, some defenses might introduce significant overhead, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained environments.\n3. The paper does not consider the impact of different data distributions on the performance of the attacks and defenses. In real-world scenarios, the data distribution may not be uniform, and this can affect the performance of the attacks and defenses. The benchmark should include experiments with different data distributions to provide a more realistic evaluation of the performance of the attacks and defenses. For instance, the performance of some attacks might be significantly affected by class imbalance or non-IID data distributions.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nTo enhance the benchmark's comprehensiveness, the authors should provide a clear rationale for the selection of the 11 attacks and 8 defenses. This should include a discussion of the threat model each attack represents and the specific vulnerabilities each defense aims to mitigate. A more systematic approach, perhaps based on a taxonomy of attacks and defenses, would strengthen the benchmark's validity. For example, the authors could categorize attacks based on their target (e.g., model parameters, data privacy, backdoor injection) and defenses based on their mechanism (e.g., gradient perturbation, differential privacy, adversarial training). This would provide a more structured and justifiable selection process. Furthermore, the authors should consider including more recent and sophisticated attacks and defenses to ensure the benchmark remains relevant and challenging.\n\nTo address the lack of computational cost analysis, the authors should include a detailed evaluation of the time and resource requirements for each attack and defense method. This should include metrics such as training time, inference time, memory usage, and communication overhead. The analysis should also consider the scalability of each method with respect to the number of participants and the size of the dataset. This information is crucial for practitioners to assess the practical feasibility of each method. For example, the authors could provide a table summarizing the computational cost of each method under different settings. This would allow users to make informed decisions about which methods are suitable for their specific resource constraints. Additionally, the authors should discuss the trade-offs between computational cost and performance for each method.\n\nFinally, to improve the benchmark's realism, the authors should include experiments with different data distributions. This should include scenarios with class imbalance, non-IID data, and varying degrees of data heterogeneity. The authors should analyze how these different data distributions affect the performance of the attacks and defenses. This analysis should include a discussion of the specific challenges posed by each data distribution and how the different methods perform under these challenges. For example, the authors could include experiments with synthetic datasets that simulate different data distributions. This would provide a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation of the performance of the attacks and defenses. The authors should also discuss the limitations of the benchmark in terms of the data distributions considered and suggest future research directions to address these limitations.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

How does the performance of the attacks and defenses vary with the size of the dataset?\n3. How does the performance of the attacks and defenses vary with the complexity of the VFL model?\n4. How does the performance of the attacks and defenses vary with the communication protocol used in the VFL system?\n5. How does the performance of the attacks and defenses vary with the model partition setting used in the VFL system?\n\n### Rating\n\n6: marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n### Confidence\n\n4: You are confident in your assessment, but not absolutely certain.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces VFLAIR, a modular and lightweight framework designed to facilitate research and development in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). The authors aim to address the gap between industrial-grade VFL solutions and the needs of the research community by providing a comprehensive platform that supports a wide range of VFL algorithms, defense methods, and evaluation metrics. VFLAIR includes standardized pipelines for training and validation, accommodating diverse datasets, local model architectures, global models, model partition settings, communication protocols, and encryption methods. The framework supports both tree-based and neural network models, and it incorporates various communication protocols such as FedSGD, FedBCD, CELU-VFL, Quantize, and Top-k. A key contribution of this work is the introduction of new evaluation metrics, including the Defense Capability Score (DCS), which aims to provide a unified measure for comparing the effectiveness of different defense strategies against various attacks. The authors conducted extensive experiments to benchmark various aspects of VFL, including model performance, communication efficiency, and robustness to attacks. These experiments provide insights into system design choices and aim to guide future development and practical deployment of VFL systems. The paper presents results on several datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, and others, demonstrating the performance of different VFL models under various settings. The authors also evaluate the effectiveness of different defense methods against a range of attacks, providing a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs between model accuracy, communication efficiency, and security. Overall, the paper seeks to provide a valuable resource for the VFL research community by offering a flexible and comprehensive framework for experimentation and benchmarking, along with a new evaluation metric to assess defense capabilities. However, the paper also has some limitations, including a lack of detailed comparisons with existing frameworks, a limited discussion of ethical implications, and a lack of analysis of computational complexity and scalability, which I will discuss in detail in the following sections.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n2.75\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nI find several strengths in this paper that contribute to its overall value. First, the development of VFLAIR as a lightweight and modular framework is a significant contribution. The framework's modularity allows for easy integration and experimentation with various VFL algorithms, defense methods, and evaluation metrics. This flexibility is crucial for researchers who need a platform that can adapt to different research questions and experimental setups. The inclusion of standardized pipelines for training and validation further enhances the usability of the framework, making it accessible to a broader audience. Second, the paper's comprehensive approach to benchmarking is commendable. The authors evaluate various aspects of VFL, including model performance, communication efficiency, and robustness to attacks. This holistic approach provides a more complete picture of the strengths and weaknesses of different VFL configurations. The inclusion of diverse datasets, model architectures, and communication protocols makes the benchmark more representative of real-world scenarios. Third, the introduction of the Defense Capability Score (DCS) is a valuable contribution. This metric provides a unified way to compare the effectiveness of different defense strategies against various attacks, which is essential for developing robust VFL systems. The authors' efforts to provide a comprehensive evaluation of defense methods are particularly relevant given the growing concerns about security in federated learning. Finally, the paper is well-written and organized, with clear explanations of the framework, experimental setup, and results. The authors provide sufficient details to understand the methodology and reproduce the experiments, which is crucial for the scientific community. The inclusion of tables and figures to present the results makes the paper more accessible and easier to understand. Overall, the paper's strengths lie in its comprehensive approach to VFL research, its modular framework, and its introduction of a new evaluation metric, all of which contribute to its overall significance.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper lacks a detailed comparison of VFLAIR with existing VFL frameworks and libraries. While the authors mention several frameworks such as FATE, Fedlearner, PaddleFL, Pysygt, FedTree, and FedML, they do not provide a thorough analysis of how VFLAIR compares to these existing solutions in terms of features, performance, and ease of use. The paper states that industrial-grade frameworks are not designed for research advances, but it does not provide a feature-by-feature comparison to demonstrate the specific advantages of VFLAIR. This omission makes it difficult for readers to understand the novelty and contributions of the proposed framework. For example, a table comparing the supported model architectures, communication protocols, and defense mechanisms, along with their specific implementations in each framework, would be highly valuable. This lack of comparative analysis is a significant weakness, as it limits the reader's ability to assess the practical advantages of VFLAIR. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper explicitly mentions these frameworks but fails to provide a detailed comparison. Second, the paper lacks a thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed framework and potential future research directions. While the conclusion briefly mentions a limitation regarding cryptographic techniques, a broader discussion of the scenarios where VFLAIR might not be the most suitable solution is missing. The authors do not discuss the potential challenges in extending VFLAIR to support new models, datasets, or defense mechanisms. Furthermore, the paper does not outline specific research directions that could address these limitations. This omission is a weakness because it prevents the reader from fully understanding the scope and applicability of the framework. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper lacks a dedicated section on limitations and future work. Third, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of VFLAIR. While the paper provides some empirical data on execution time, it lacks a theoretical analysis of the computational cost of the framework, considering the number of participants, the size of the datasets, and the complexity of the models. The paper also does not provide empirical results demonstrating the scalability of VFLAIR, showing how the training time and communication overhead vary with the number of participants and the size of the datasets. This lack of analysis is a weakness because it limits the reader's ability to assess the practical applicability of VFLAIR in real-world scenarios. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper lacks a theoretical analysis of computational complexity and a systematic evaluation of scalability. Fourth, the paper does not discuss the potential ethical implications of VFL and the proposed framework. The paper focuses on the technical aspects of VFL, including attacks and defenses, but it does not address the ethical considerations related to data privacy, security, and fairness in the context of VFL. This omission is a weakness because it fails to acknowledge the potential risks of data leakage, bias in the models, and the potential for misuse of the framework. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper lacks any discussion on the ethical implications of VFL. Fifth, the paper only considers 11 attacks and 8 defenses, which may not be representative of all possible attacks and defenses in VFL. The selection criteria for these specific attacks and defenses are not clearly justified, raising concerns about the generalizability of the benchmark. It is unclear if the chosen attacks represent the most potent threats or if the defenses are the most effective against those specific attacks. This lack of justification is a weakness because it limits the reader's ability to assess the robustness of the framework. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper lists the attacks and defenses but does not provide a clear justification for their selection. Sixth, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the different attacks and defenses. While the paper provides overall execution time for VFL training, it does not provide a breakdown of the computational cost for each individual attack and defense method. This lack of analysis is a weakness because it makes it difficult to assess the practical applicability of each method. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of individual attacks and defenses. Seventh, the paper does not consider the impact of different data distributions on the performance of the attacks and defenses. The experiments are conducted on standard datasets without manipulating their distribution. This omission is a weakness because it does not reflect real-world scenarios where data distribution may not be uniform. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper does not include experiments or analysis on the impact of different data distributions. Eighth, the paper only provides an overview of the workflow in the method section, lacking a detailed introduction to the specific implementation of various components within the framework. While the authors mention modularity, the paper lacks a clear explanation of how each component is implemented and how they interact within the framework. For instance, the specific data preprocessing steps for each dataset, the exact model architectures used, and the detailed algorithmic steps for each defense method are not elaborated upon. This lack of detail makes it difficult to understand the practical implementation of the framework and to reproduce the results. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the method section provides an overview but lacks detailed implementation specifics for various components. Ninth, the results of the VFL benchmark are presented in the form of bar charts and tables, but the authors do not provide a detailed analysis and discussion of these results. The analysis primarily focuses on comparing the performance of different defense methods based on the proposed DCS metric, but it lacks a deeper investigation into why certain methods perform better than others under specific attack scenarios. For example, the paper does not explore the underlying reasons for the observed trade-offs between main task performance and attack performance for different defense methods. This lack of in-depth analysis is a weakness because it limits the reader's ability to fully understand the results. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the results section focuses on presenting data and high-level analysis based on DCS, lacking deeper mechanistic explanations. Finally, the authors introduce a new evaluation metric, DCS, but do not compare it with other existing evaluation metrics. While the authors argue that there are no directly applicable evaluation metrics for the specific problem of evaluating defense methods against various attacks in VFL, they do not provide a thorough justification for why a comparison with related metrics from broader fields like privacy or security is not relevant. Furthermore, the paper does not include a detailed analysis of the limitations of the DCS metric, such as its sensitivity to the choice of weighting parameters or its potential biases towards certain types of attacks or defenses. This lack of comparison and analysis is a weakness because it limits the reader's ability to assess the validity and usefulness of the DCS metric. My confidence in this weakness is high, as the paper introduces DCS without comparing it to other metrics or analyzing its limitations in detail.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nTo address the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements. First, the authors should provide a more detailed comparison of VFLAIR with existing VFL frameworks. This comparison should not only focus on the features supported but also on the implementation details, performance characteristics, and ease of use. A table comparing the supported model architectures, communication protocols, and defense mechanisms, along with their specific implementations in each framework, would be highly valuable. Furthermore, the comparison should include quantitative metrics such as training time, communication overhead, and memory usage for different scenarios. This would allow readers to assess the practical advantages and disadvantages of VFLAIR compared to existing solutions and understand the specific niche it aims to fill. The authors should also discuss the trade-offs made in VFLAIR's design, such as the choice of specific algorithms or the level of abstraction, and how these choices impact its performance and applicability. Second, the authors should include a thorough discussion of the limitations of VFLAIR and potential future research directions. The authors should acknowledge the specific scenarios where VFLAIR might not be the most suitable solution, such as very large-scale federated learning settings or specific types of data distributions. They should also discuss the potential challenges in extending VFLAIR to support new models, datasets, or defense mechanisms. Furthermore, the authors should outline specific research directions that could address these limitations, such as exploring more efficient communication protocols, developing more robust defense mechanisms, or improving the scalability of the framework. This discussion should also include potential ethical implications of VFL and the proposed framework. The authors should address the ethical considerations related to data privacy, security, and fairness in the context of VFL. This discussion should include potential risks of data leakage, bias in the models, and the potential for misuse of the framework. The authors should also discuss how VFLAIR can be used to mitigate these risks and promote responsible use of VFL. Third, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity and scalability of VFLAIR. This analysis should include a theoretical analysis of the computational cost of the framework, considering the number of participants, the size of the datasets, and the complexity of the models. They should also provide empirical results demonstrating the scalability of VFLAIR, showing how the training time and communication overhead vary with the number of participants and the size of the datasets. This analysis should include a discussion of the bottlenecks in the framework and potential strategies for improving its scalability. For example, the authors could explore techniques such as model compression, distributed training, or asynchronous communication to reduce the computational cost and communication overhead. Fourth, the authors should provide a clear rationale for the selection of the 11 attacks and 8 defenses. This should include a discussion of the threat model each attack represents and the specific vulnerabilities each defense aims to mitigate. A more systematic approach, perhaps based on a taxonomy of attacks and defenses, would strengthen the benchmark's validity. For example, the authors could categorize attacks based on their target (e.g., model parameters, data privacy, backdoor injection) and defenses based on their mechanism (e.g., gradient perturbation, differential privacy, adversarial training). This would provide a more structured and justifiable selection process. Furthermore, the authors should consider including more recent and sophisticated attacks and defenses to ensure the benchmark remains relevant and challenging. Fifth, the authors should include a detailed evaluation of the time and resource requirements for each attack and defense method. This should include metrics such as training time, inference time, memory usage, and communication overhead. The analysis should also consider the scalability of each method with respect to the number of participants and the size of the dataset. This information is crucial for practitioners to assess the practical feasibility of each method. For example, the authors could provide a table summarizing the computational cost of each method under different settings. This would allow users to make informed decisions about which methods are suitable for their specific resource constraints. Additionally, the authors should discuss the trade-offs between computational cost and performance for each method. Sixth, the authors should include experiments with different data distributions. This should include scenarios with class imbalance, non-IID data, and varying degrees of data heterogeneity. The authors should analyze how these different data distributions affect the performance of the attacks and defenses. This analysis should include a discussion of the specific challenges posed by each data distribution and how the different methods perform under these challenges. For example, the authors could include experiments with synthetic datasets that simulate different data distributions. This would provide a more comprehensive and realistic evaluation of the performance of the attacks and defenses. The authors should also discuss the limitations of the benchmark in terms of the data distributions considered and suggest future research directions to address these limitations. Seventh, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the implementation of various components within the VFL framework. This should include a description of the data preprocessing steps for each dataset, the specific model architectures used (including the number of layers, activation functions, and hyperparameters), and the detailed algorithmic steps for each defense method. For example, when discussing the implementation of a specific defense method, the authors should provide the exact mathematical formulation and the step-by-step procedure for integrating it into the VFL training process. This would greatly enhance the reproducibility of the results and allow other researchers to build upon the proposed framework. Furthermore, the authors should include a detailed discussion of the design choices made during the implementation, such as the rationale behind selecting specific model architectures or defense methods for each dataset. This would provide valuable insights into the practical considerations of applying VFL in different scenarios. Eighth, the authors should conduct a more in-depth analysis of the benchmark results. This should include a detailed discussion of the observed trade-offs between main task performance and attack performance for different defense methods. For example, the authors could investigate why certain defense methods are more effective against specific types of attacks and why some methods lead to a significant drop in main task performance. This analysis should also explore the impact of different hyperparameters on the performance of defense methods and the limitations of the proposed DCS metric. The authors should also consider including a sensitivity analysis of the DCS metric to the choice of weighting parameters and discuss its potential biases towards certain types of attacks or defenses. Finally, the authors should provide a more thorough justification for the introduction of the DCS metric and its comparison with existing evaluation metrics from related fields. While it is understandable that there may not be directly applicable evaluation metrics for the specific problem of evaluating defense methods against various attacks in VFL, the authors should explore the possibility of adapting existing metrics from broader fields like privacy or security. For example, metrics such as membership inference attack success rate or differential privacy guarantees could be considered as baselines for comparison. The authors should also discuss the limitations of the DCS metric in detail, including its sensitivity to the choice of weighting parameters and its potential biases towards certain types of attacks or defenses.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the paper.

The core motivation stems from the observation that while VFL is increasingly relevant in industrial applications, existing frameworks are often cumbersome and lack the flexibility needed for cutting-edge research. This gap hinders the systematic evaluation of novel VFL techniques, particularly concerning security and efficiency. The authors aim to address this by providing a lightweight, modular platform that supports a wide range of VFL configurations, attack scenarios, and defense mechanisms. This is a significant contribution, as the field of federated learning has evolved from its initial focus on horizontal data partitioning to address the more common real-world scenario of vertical partitioning. Early VFL approaches were often bespoke and lacked standardization, making comparisons difficult. The increasing research activity in VFL, focusing on communication efficiency and robustness against attacks, underscores the need for a comprehensive benchmark like VFLAIR. \n\nThe central problem addressed by this work is the absence of a unified platform for VFL research. This lack of a standardized environment makes it difficult to compare different methods and track progress. The authors rightly emphasize the importance of addressing security vulnerabilities in VFL, particularly the susceptibility to data inference and backdoor attacks. The real-world implications are substantial, as the adoption of VFL in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare necessitates robust security guarantees. The conceptual framework of VFLAIR is built around modularity and extensibility, allowing researchers to easily experiment with different model architectures, communication protocols, and defense strategies. This modular design is a key strength, enabling the systematic exploration of the VFL design space. However, it is worth noting that the framework's focus on specific types of attacks and defenses might be a limitation, potentially overlooking other emerging threats.\n\nThe methodology centers on the design and implementation of the VFLAIR framework. The modular design, with distinct components for datasets, local models, global models, communication protocols, and defense methods, is a sound approach. The choice of supporting both aggregation-based (aggVFL) and split-based (splitVFL) models provides flexibility. The inclusion of various communication protocols, such as FedSGD, FedBCD, CELU-VFL, Quantize, and Top-k, allows for evaluating the trade-offs between communication efficiency and model performance. The selection of eleven attacks and eight defense methods demonstrates a commitment to comprehensive security evaluation. The introduction of new evaluation metrics, such as Defense Capability Score (DCS), Type-level DCS (T-DCS), and Comprehensive DCS (C-DCS), is crucial for quantifying the effectiveness of different defense strategies. However, the specific design choices within each module could be further explored for potential biases or limitations. For example, the specific implementation of gradient compression in the Top-k protocol might influence its performance. \n\nThe experimental design involves benchmarking VFL main task performance and evaluating the effectiveness of attacks and defenses. The choice of datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, NUSWIDE, and several real-world datasets, provides a diverse set of evaluation scenarios. The use of multiple local model architectures and global models allows for assessing the framework's versatility. The metrics used, such as Main Task Performance (MP), Attack Performance (AP), number of communication rounds, amount of data transferred, and execution time, are appropriate for evaluating both utility and security. The experiments on attack and defense performance, conducted on MNIST, CIFAR10, and NUSWIDE, systematically evaluate the trade-offs between model utility and defense effectiveness. The use of the DCS metrics provides a unified way to compare different defense strategies. However, the specific hyperparameter settings for the attacks and defenses could be a confounding factor. Alternative experimental designs could involve more complex, real-world datasets or a greater number of participating parties. The statistical validity of the results depends on the number of trials and the variance of the observed metrics.\n\nThe results indicate that splitVFL generally achieves comparable or slightly higher MP than aggVFL, potentially due to the additional trainable layer in the global model. The finding that FedBCD and CELU-VFL achieve comparable MP with fewer communication rounds than FedSGD highlights their efficiency. The significant increase in execution time with Paillier Encryption underscores the computational cost of security measures. The observation that increasing the number of participants slightly lowers MP suggests the challenges of multi-party collaboration. The results also demonstrate that certain attacks, like DS and DLI, are particularly effective, emphasizing the need for robust defenses. The trade-offs between MP and AP observed when applying defenses are expected. The consistency of DCS rankings across datasets suggests the robustness of the proposed metrics. The finding that splitVFL is less vulnerable to attacks than aggVFL, and that FedBCD is less vulnerable than FedSGD, provides valuable insights for practical VFL deployment. However, alternative interpretations of the results might focus on the specific conditions under which these findings hold. The strength of the evidence depends on the statistical significance of the observed differences. The generalizability of these findings to other VFL settings and datasets needs further investigation.\n\nIn summary, VFLAIR provides a valuable tool for researchers to systematically explore the design space of VFL and evaluate the effectiveness of different defense strategies. The framework bridges the gap between industrial-grade VFL systems and research-focused platforms. The proposed DCS metrics offer a unified way to assess defense performance. Future research directions include extending the framework to support more complex VFL scenarios, incorporating additional attack and defense mechanisms, and developing more sophisticated evaluation metrics. The practical applications of VFLAIR lie in facilitating the development of more secure and efficient VFL systems for real-world collaborative learning tasks. The societal impact of this work is potentially significant, as it contributes to the development of privacy-preserving machine learning techniques. Long-term implications include the acceleration of VFL research and the development of more robust and trustworthy collaborative learning systems.\n\nCritically, several limitations of the paper and the VFLAIR framework can be identified. The framework, while comprehensive, might not cover all possible VFL architectures, communication protocols, or attack/defense mechanisms. The theoretical underpinnings of the proposed DCS metrics could be further elaborated. Methodologically, the choice of specific attacks and defenses might introduce bias. The hyperparameter settings for these methods could significantly impact the results. The framework's reliance on specific datasets might limit the generalizability of the findings. Experimentally, the number of participating parties in some experiments might be limited. The computational resources required to run all the experiments could be a barrier for some researchers. The statistical significance of some of the observed differences might need further investigation. Practically, the framework's usability and ease of integration with existing research workflows could be improved. The computational overhead of certain security mechanisms, like Paillier Encryption, needs to be carefully considered in practical deployments. To enhance the theoretical foundations, future work could explore formal privacy guarantees for the implemented defense mechanisms. Methodological improvements could involve developing adaptive attack and defense strategies. Experimental refinements could include more extensive hyperparameter tuning and the use of larger and more diverse datasets. Practical enhancements could focus on developing a user-friendly interface and providing clear guidelines for using the framework. Theoretical extensions could involve incorporating differential privacy or secure multi-party computation techniques directly into the framework. Algorithm improvements could focus on developing more efficient communication protocols or robust defense mechanisms. New application domains for VFLAIR could include healthcare, finance, and IoT. Integration possibilities include combining VFLAIR with existing federated learning platforms. Performance optimizations could focus on reducing the computational overhead of the framework. Scalability enhancements could address the challenges of deploying VFL with a large number of participants.}\n\nNow, please tell me the answers to the three questions from the recent search.", "questions": ["What are the primary technical approaches used in existing Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) frameworks to ensure data privacy and security, and how have these evolved over the past five years?", "How have the communication efficiency techniques in VFL frameworks been developed and what are the key challenges in implementing these techniques in multi-party settings?", "What are the current limitations and challenges in evaluating the robustness of VFL systems against various types of attacks, and how have these limitations been addressed in recent studies?"], "retrieval": [{"final_passages": "[0] Title: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework with General Aggregation and Multiparty Entity Matching Text: The requirement for data sharing and privacy has brought increasing attention to federated learning. However, the existing aggregation models are too specialized and deal less with users\u2019 withdrawal issue. Moreover, protocols for multiparty entity matching are rarely covered. Thus, there is no systematic framework to perform federated learning tasks. In this paper, we systematically propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework (PFLF) where we first construct a general secure aggregation model in federated learning scenarios by combining the Shamir secret sharing with homomorphic cryptography to ensure that the aggregated value can be decrypted correctly only when the number of participants is greater than \n \n t\n \n . Furthermore, we propose a multiparty entity matching protocol by employing secure multiparty computing to solve the entity alignment problems and a logistic regression algorithm to achieve privacy-preserving model training and support the withdrawal of users in vertical federated learning (VFL) scenarios. Finally, the security analyses prove that PFLF preserves the data privacy in the honest-but-curious model, and the experimental evaluations show PFLF attains consistent accuracy with the original model and demonstrates the practical feasibility.\n[1] Title: Mutual Information Regularization for Vertical Federated Learning Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is widely utilized in real-world applications to enable collaborative learning while protecting data privacy and safety. However, previous works show that parties without labels (passive parties) in VFL can infer the sensitive label information owned by the party with labels (active party) or execute backdoor attacks to VFL. Meanwhile, active party can also infer sensitive feature information from passive party. All these pose new privacy and security challenges to VFL systems. We propose a new general defense method which limits the mutual information between private raw data, including both features and labels, and intermediate outputs to achieve a better trade-off between model utility and privacy. We term this defense Mutual Information Regularization Defense (MID). We theoretically and experimentally testify the effectiveness of our MID method in defending existing attacks in VFL, including label inference attacks, backdoor attacks and feature reconstruction attacks.\n[2] Title: Approaching Expressive and Secure Vertical Federated Learning With Embedding Alignment in Intelligent IoT Systems Text: In the context of vertical federated learning (VFL), agents utilize multimodal data on their edge devices to corporately train and inference with the deep learning models. However, in classical VFL, there exists three problems from the perspective of embeddings. 1) the utilization of oversimplified embedding fusion mechanism may result in suboptimal performance of the models; 2) the exchange of embeddings and their gradients poses a potential risk of private information leakage, as they inherently contain sensitive information; 3) finally, the withdrawal of some agents from cooperation disrupts the collaborative inference capabilities of the remaining agents. To mitigate these problems, this article introduces a novel VFL algorithm grounded in embedding alignment. It includes two distinct schemes: 1) performance-oriented scheme (POS) and 2) privacy-respecting scheme (PRS). Within POS, this article employs contrastive loss and joint fine-tuning to augment the expressiveness and the overall performance of models. While the PRS incorporates homomorphic-encryption-based contrastive loss and individual fine-tuning to safeguard the data security. In addition, the PRS eliminates the necessity of collaborative inference. In this article, comprehensive security analysis and proofs are conducted for PRS. Moreover, experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed POS over classical VFL, showcasing a substantial performance improvement. Simultaneously, the PRS surpasses the performance of training alone, even under stringent security constraints.\n[3] Title: A Unified Solution for Privacy and Communication Efficiency in Vertical Federated Learning Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables multiple participants to jointly train a model on their private data without sharing it. To make VFL practical, privacy security and communication efficiency should both be satisfied. Recent research has shown that Zero-Order Optimization (ZOO) in VFL can effectively conceal the internal information of the model without adding costly privacy protective add-ons, making it a promising approach for privacy and efficiency. However, there are still two key problems that have yet to be resolved. First, the convergence rate of ZOO-based VFL is significantly slower compared to gradient-based VFL, resulting in low efficiency in model training and more communication round, which hinders its application on large neural networks. Second, although ZOO-based VFL has demonstrated resistance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks, its privacy guarantee lacks a theoretical explanation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cascaded hybrid optimization approach that employs a zeroth-order (ZO) gradient on the most critical output layer of the clients, with other parts utilizing the first-order (FO) gradient. This approach preserves the privacy protection of ZOO while significantly enhancing convergence. Moreover, we theoretically prove that applying ZOO to the VFL is equivalent to adding Gaussian Mechanism to the gradient information, which offers an implicit differential privacy guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves similar utility as the Gaussian mechanism under the same privacy budget, while also having significantly lower communication costs compared with SOTA communication-efficient VFL frameworks.\n[4] Title: Secure Vertical Federated Learning Under Unreliable Connectivity Text: Most work in privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) has focused on horizontally partitioned datasets where clients hold the same features and train complete client-level models independently. However, individual data points are often scattered across different institutions, known as clients, in vertical FL (VFL) settings. Addressing this category of FL necessitates the exchange of intermediate outputs and gradients among participants, resulting in potential privacy leakage risks and slow convergence rates. Additionally, in many real-world scenarios, VFL training also faces the acute issue of client stragglers and drop-outs, a serious challenge that can significantly hinder the training process but has been largely overlooked in existing studies. In this work, we present vFedSec, a first dropout-tolerant VFL protocol, which can support the most generalized vertical framework. It achieves secure and efficient model training by using an innovative Secure Layer alongside an embedding-padding technique. We provide theoretical proof that our design attains enhanced security while maintaining training performance. Empirical results from extensive experiments also demonstrate vFedSec is robust to client dropout and provides secure training with negligible computation and communication overhead. Compared to widely adopted homomorphic encryption (HE) methods, our approach achieves a remarkable>690x speedup and reduces communication costs significantly by>9.6x.\n[5] Title: Privacy-Preserving Vertical Federated Logistic Regression without Trusted Third-Party Coordinator Text: Federated learning is a new distributed learning paradigm, which allows multiple parties to cooperatively train a centralized model without sharing their data. In this paper, a privacy-preserving logistic regression (LR) training algorithm for vertical federated learning (VFL) is proposed. First, this paper analyzes the related works and point out the privacy leakage risks. Then, based on the mini-batch SGD and parameter encryption method, a secure VFL model training scheme for LR without the assistance of a trusted third-party is designed. Next, to protect the privacy of model parameters, a differentially-private algorithm and comprehensive privacy analysis are provided. Finally, experiments show that the algorithm not only guarantees the security and privacy, but also ensures the model utility.\n[6] Title: Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Feature Importance-Based Vertical Federated Learning Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables multiple data owners, each holding a different subset of features about a largely overlapping set of data samples, to collaboratively train a global model. The quality of data owners\u2019 local features affects the performance of the VFL model, which makes feature selection vitally important. However, existing feature selection methods for VFL either assume the availability of prior knowledge on the number of noisy features or prior knowledge on the post-training threshold of useful features to be selected, making them unsuitable for practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose the Federated Stochastic Dual-Gate based Feature Selection (FedSDG-FS) approach. It consists of a Gaussian stochastic dual-gate to efficiently approximate the probability of a feature being selected. FedSDG-FS further designs a local embedding perturbation approach to achieve differential privacy for local training data. To reduce overhead, we propose a feature importance initialization method based on Gini impurity, which can accomplish its goals with only two parameter transmissions between the server and the clients. The enhanced version, FedSDG-FS++, protects the privacy for both the clients\u2019 training data and the server's labels through Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) without relying on a trusted third-party. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence rate, privacy guarantees and security analysis of our methods. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that FedSDG-FS and FedSDG-FS++ significantly outperform existing approaches in terms of achieving more accurate selection of high-quality features as well as improving VFL performance in a privacy-preserving manner.\n[7] Title: FEVERLESS: Fast and Secure Vertical Federated Learning Based on XGBoost for Decentralized Labels Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model over vertically partitioned data without leaking private local information. Tree-based models, like XGBoost and LightGBM, have been widely used in VFL to enhance the interpretation and efficiency of training. However, there is a fundamental lack of research on how to conduct VFL securely over distributed labels. This work is the first to fill this gap by designing a novel protocol, called FEVERLESS, based on XGBoost. FEVERLESS leverages secure aggregation via information masking technique and global differential privacy provided by a fairly and randomly selected noise leader to prevent private information from being leaked in the training process. Furthermore, it provides label and data privacy against honest-but-curious adversaries even in the case of collusion of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n- 2$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"wang-ieq1-3227326.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> out of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"wang-ieq2-3227326.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> clients. We present a comprehensive security and efficiency analysis for our design, and the empirical results from our experiments demonstrate that FEVERLESS is fast and secure. In particular, it outperforms the solution based on additive homomorphic encryption in runtime cost and provides better accuracy than the local differential privacy approach.\n[8] Title: FLSG: A Novel Defense Strategy Against Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning Text: As a new machine learning (ML) paradigm, federated learning (FL) empowers different participants to jointly train a more effective model than traditional ML. Unlike horizontal FL (HFL), which expands the sample space by aggregating local models, vertical FL (VFL) is suitable for scenarios where the sample ID between participants is the same but differs in sample characteristics. For a long time, VFL has been considered safe due to no data exchange and heterogeneity between parties. However, the recently proposed label inference attacks pose a significant security threat to VFL. Specifically, by adding randomly initialized layers to the top of local models, the passive label inference attack can infer tens of thousands of local participants\u2019 private data with only 40 auxiliary labels. Since the attack is entirely local, using privacy protection technologies such as differential privacy cannot effectively defend against these attacks. Therefore, we propose a new privacy protection scheme called FL similar gradients (FLSGs) to defend against this attack. Unlike differential privacy, the FLSG scheme randomly generates gradients of a Gaussian distribution similar in dimension to the original gradients and calculates their cosine distance. If the distance is less than a certain threshold, the gradients are used instead of the original gradients to pass to the local participants. We conducted extensive evaluations on six real-world data sets, and the results show that FLSG provides a better defensive effect at lower computational overhead than other known methods when defending the passive label inference attack.\n[9] Title: Secure Forward Aggregation for Vertical Federated Neural Networks Text: Vertical federated learning (VFL) is attracting much attention because it enables cross-silo data cooperation in a privacy-preserving manner. While most research works in VFL focus on linear and tree models, deep models (e.g., neural networks) are not well studied in VFL. In this paper, we focus on SplitNN, a well-known neural network framework in VFL, and identify a trade-off between data security and model performance in SplitNN. Briefly, SplitNN trains the model by exchanging gradients and transformed data. On the one hand, SplitNN suffers from the loss of model performance since multiply parties jointly train the model using transformed data instead of raw data, and a large amount of low-level feature information is discarded. On the other hand, a naive solution of increasing the model performance through aggregating at lower layers in SplitNN (i.e., the data is less transformed and more low-level feature is preserved) makes raw data vulnerable to inference attacks. To mitigate the above trade-off, we propose a new neural network protocol in VFL called Security Forward Aggregation (SFA). It changes the way of aggregating the transformed data and adopts removable masks to protect the raw data. Experiment results show that networks with SFA achieve both data security and high model performance.\n", "keywords": " Vertical Federated Learning, data privacy in VFL, security in VFL, VFL evolution", "output": "Over the past five years, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) frameworks have employed various technical approaches to ensure data privacy and security. These approaches can be broadly categorized into three main categories: secure aggregation, privacy-preserving algorithms, and secure multiparty computation.\n\nSecure aggregation is a technique used to protect the privacy of individual data points by aggregating the gradients or intermediate results in a way that prevents the disclosure of sensitive information. In [0], a privacy-preserving federated learning framework (PFLF) is proposed, which combines Shamir secret sharing with homomorphic cryptography to ensure that the aggregated value can be decrypted correctly only when the number of participants is greater than t. Another approach is the use of zero-order optimization (ZOO) in VFL, which effectively conceals the internal information of the model without adding costly privacy protective add-ons [3]. However, the convergence rate of ZOO-based VFL is significantly slower compared to gradient-based VFL, resulting in low efficiency in model training and more communication rounds.\n\nPrivacy-preserving algorithms are used to protect the privacy of individual data points by limiting the mutual information between private raw data and intermediate outputs [1]. Mutual Information Regularization Defense (MID) is a defense method that limits the mutual information between private raw data, including both features and labels, and intermediate outputs to achieve a better trade-off between model utility and privacy. Another approach is the use of embedding alignment in VFL, which employs contrastive loss and joint fine-tuning to augment the expressiveness and overall performance of models, while incorporating homomorphic-encryption-based contrastive loss and individual fine-tuning to safeguard the data security [2].\n\nSecure multiparty computation is a technique used to enable secure computation on private data without revealing the data itself. In [4], a novel VFL protocol, vFedSec, is proposed, which uses an innovative Secure Layer alongside an embedding-padding technique to achieve secure and efficient model training. The protocol provides theoretical proof that it attains enhanced security while maintaining training performance. In [5], a privacy-preserving logistic regression training algorithm for VFL is proposed, which uses parameter encryption and differentially-private algorithms to protect the privacy of model parameters. In [6], a feature importance-based VFL approach is proposed, which uses a Gaussian stochastic dual-gate to efficiently approximate the probability of a feature being selected and achieves differential privacy for local training data.\n\nIn addition, some recent works have focused on addressing the issue of client stragglers and drop-outs in VFL. In [4], a dropout-tolerant VFL protocol is proposed, which can support the most generalized vertical framework and achieves secure and efficient model training. In [7], a novel protocol, FEVERLESS, is proposed, which leverages secure aggregation via information masking technique and global differential privacy provided by a fairly and randomly selected noise leader to prevent private information from being leaked in the training process.\n\nIn summary, the primary technical approaches used in existing VFL frameworks to ensure data privacy and security include secure aggregation, privacy-preserving algorithms, and secure multiparty computation.

Although MPC has been studied substantially, building solutions that are practical in terms of computation and communication cost is still a major challenge. In this paper, we investigate the practical usefulness of MPC for multi-domain network security and monitoring. We first optimize MPC comparison operations for processing high volume data in near real-time. We then design privacy-preserving protocols for event correlation and aggregation of network traffic statistics, such as addition of volume metrics, computation of feature entropy, and distinct item count. Optimizing performance of parallel invocations, we implement our protocols along with a complete set of basic operations in a library called SEPIA. We evaluate the running time and bandwidth requirements of our protocols in realistic settings on a local cluster as well as on PlanetLab and show that they work in near real-time for up to 140 input providers and 9 computation nodes. Compared to implementations using existing general-purpose MPC frameworks, our protocols are significantly faster, requiring, for example, 3 minutes for a task that takes 2 days with general-purpose frameworks. This improvement paves the way for new applications of MPC in the area of networking. Finally, we run SEPIA's protocols on real traffic traces of 17 networks and show how they provide new possibilities for distributed troubleshooting and early anomaly detection.\n[1] Title: VERTICES: Efficient Two-Party Vertical Federated Linear Model with TTP-aided Secret Sharing Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as one of the most predominant approaches for secure collaborative machine learning where the training data is partitioned by features among multiple parties. Most VFL algorithms primarily rely on two fundamental privacy-preserving techniques: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Though generally considered with stronger privacy guarantees, existing general-purpose MPC frameworks suffer from expensive computation and communication overhead and are inefficient especially under VFL settings. This study centers around MPC-based VFL algorithms and presents a novel approach for two-party vertical federated linear models via an efficient secret sharing (SS) scheme with a trusted coordinator. Our approach can achieve significant acceleration of the training procedure in vertical federated linear models of between 2.5x and 6.6x than other existing MPC frameworks under the same security setting.\n[2] Title: Hybrid Differentially Private Federated Learning on Vertically Partitioned Data Text: We present HDP-VFL, the first hybrid differentially private (DP) framework for vertical federated learning (VFL) to demonstrate that it is possible to jointly learn a generalized linear model (GLM) from vertically partitioned data with only a negligible cost, w.r.t. training time, accuracy, etc., comparing to idealized non-private VFL. Our work builds on the recent advances in VFL-based collaborative training among different organizations which rely on protocols like Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to secure computation and training. In particular, we analyze how VFL's intermediate result (IR) can leak private information of the training data during communication and design a DP-based privacy-preserving algorithm to ensure the data confidentiality of VFL participants. We mathematically prove that our algorithm not only provides utility guarantees for VFL, but also offers multi-level privacy, i.e. DP w.r.t. IR and joint differential privacy (JDP) w.r.t. model weights. Experimental results demonstrate that our work, under adequate privacy budgets, is quantitatively and qualitatively similar to GLMs, learned in idealized non-private VFL setting, rather than the increased cost in memory and processing time in most prior works based on HE or MPC. Our codes will be released if this paper is accepted.\n[3] Title: EFMVFL: An Efficient and Flexible Multi-party Vertical Federated Learning without a Third Party Text: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning setting which allows multiple participants collaboratively to train a model under the orchestration of a server without disclosing their local data. Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a special structure in FL. It handles the situation where participants have the same ID space but different feature spaces. In order to guarantee the security and privacy of the local data of each participant, homomorphic encryption (HE) is often used to transmit intermediate parameters or data during the training process. In most VFL frameworks, a trusted third-party server is necessary because the plaintexts of the parameters need to be revealed for the computation. However, it is hard to find such a credible entity in the real world. Existing methods for solving this problem are either communication-intensive or unsuitable for multi-party scenarios. By combining secret sharing (SS) and HE, we propose a novel VFL framework without any trusted third parties called EFMVFL. It allows intermediate parameters to be transmitted among multiple parties without revealing the plaintexts. EFMVFL is applicable to generalized linear models (GLMs) and supports flexible expansion to multiple participants. Extensive experiments under Logistic Regression and Poisson Regression show that our framework is outstanding in communication (reduced by 3.2\u00d7\u2013 6.8\u00d7) and efficiency (accelerated by 1.6\u00d7\u2013 3.1\u00d7).\n[4] Title: Desirable Companion for Vertical Federated Learning: New Zeroth-Order Gradient Based Algorithm Text: Vertical federated learning (VFL) attracts increasing attention due to the emerging demands of multi-party collaborative modeling and concerns of privacy leakage. A complete list of metrics to evaluate VFL algorithms should include model applicability, privacy security, communication cost, and computation efficiency, where privacy security is especially important to VFL. However, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a VFL algorithm satisfying all these criteria very well. To address this challenging problem, in this paper, we reveal that zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is a desirable companion for VFL. Specifically, ZOO can 1) improve the model applicability of VFL framework, 2) prevent VFL framework from privacy leakage under curious, colluding, and malicious threat models, 3) support inexpensive communication and efficient computation. Based on that, we propose a novel and practical VFL framework with black-box models, which is inseparably interconnected to the promising properties of ZOO. We believe that it takes one stride towards designing a practical VFL framework matching all the criteria. Under this framework, we raise two novel asynchronous zeroth-order algorithms for vertical federated learning (AsyREVEL) with different smoothing techniques. We theoretically drive the convergence rates of AsyREVEL algorithms under nonconvex condition. More importantly, we prove the privacy security of our proposed framework under existing VFL attacks on different levels. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the favorable model applicability, satisfied privacy security, inexpensive communication, efficient computation, scalability and losslessness of our framework.\n[5] Title: HashVFL: Defending Against Data Reconstruction Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a trending collaborative machine learning model training solution. Existing industrial frameworks employ secure multi-party computation techniques such as homomorphic encryption to ensure data security and privacy. Despite these efforts, studies have revealed that data leakage remains a risk in VFL due to the correlations between intermediate representations and raw data. Neural networks can accurately capture these correlations, allowing an adversary to reconstruct the data. This emphasizes the need for continued research into securing VFL systems. Our work shows that hashing is a promising solution to counter data reconstruction attacks. The one-way nature of hashing makes it difficult for an adversary to recover data from hash codes. However, implementing hashing in VFL presents new challenges, including vanishing gradients and information loss. To address these issues, we propose HashVFL, which integrates hashing and simultaneously achieves learnability, bit balance, and consistency. Experimental results indicate that HashVFL effectively maintains task performance while defending against data reconstruction attacks. It also brings additional benefits in reducing the degree of label leakage, mitigating adversarial attacks, and detecting abnormal inputs. We hope our work will inspire further research into the potential applications of HashVFL.\n[6] Title: Garbled EDA: Privacy Preserving Electronic Design Automation Text: The complexity of modern integrated circuits (ICs) necessitates collaboration between multiple distrusting parties, including third-party intellectual property (3PIP) vendors, design houses, CAD/EDA tool vendors, and foundries, which jeopardizes confidentiality and integrity of each party\u2019s IP. IP protection standards and the existing techniques proposed by researchers are ad hoc and vulnerable to numerous structural, functional, and/or side-channel attacks. Our framework, Garbled EDA, proposes an alternative direction through formulating the problem in a secure multi-party computation setting, where the privacy of IPs, CAD tools, and process design kits (PDKs) is maintained. As a proof-of-concept, Garbled EDA is evaluated in the context of simulation, where multiple IP description formats (Verilog, C, S) are supported. Our results demonstrate a reasonable logical-resource cost and negligible memory overhead. To further reduce the overhead, we present another efficient implementation methodology, feasible when the resource utilization is a bottleneck, but the communication between two parties is not restricted. Interestingly, this implementation is private and secure even in the presence of malicious adversaries attempting to, e.g., gain access to PDKs or in-house IPs of the CAD tool providers.\n[7] Title: MMVFL: A Simple Vertical Federated Learning Framework for Multi-Class Multi-Participant Scenarios Text: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving collective machine learning paradigm. Vertical federated learning (VFL) deals with the case where participants share the same sample ID space but have different feature spaces, while label information is owned by one participant. Early studies of VFL supported two participants and focused on binary-class logistic regression problems, while recent studies have put more attention on specific aspects such as communication efficiency and data security. In this paper, we propose the multi-participant multi-class vertical federated learning (MMVFL) framework for multi-class VFL problems involving multiple parties. By extending the idea of multi-view learning (MVL), MMVFL enables label sharing from its owner to other VFL participants in a privacy-preserving manner. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MMVFL, a feature selection scheme is incorporated into MMVFL to compare its performance against supervised feature selection and MVL-based approaches. The proposed framework is capable of quantifying feature importance and measuring participant contributions. It is also simple and easy to combine with other communication and security techniques. The experiment results on feature selection for classification tasks on real-world datasets show that MMVFL can effectively share label information among multiple VFL participants and match the multi-class classification performance of existing approaches.\n[8] Title: Falcon: A Privacy-Preserving and Interpretable Vertical Federated Learning System Text: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple data owners to collaboratively train machine learning (ML) models without disclosing their raw data. In the vertical federated learning (VFL) setting, the collaborating parties have data from the same set of users but with disjoint attributes. After constructing the VFL models, the parties deploy the models in production systems to infer prediction requests. In practice, the prediction output itself may not be convincing for party users to make the decisions, especially in high-stakes applications. Model interpretability is therefore essential to provide meaningful insights and better comprehension on the prediction output.\n In this paper, we propose Falcon, a novel privacy-preserving and interpretable VFL system. First, Falcon supports VFL training and prediction with strong and efficient privacy protection for a wide range of ML models, including linear regression, logistic regression, and multi-layer perceptron. The protection is achieved by a hybrid strategy of threshold partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) and additive secret sharing scheme (SSS), ensuring no intermediate information disclosure. Second, Falcon facilitates understanding of VFL model predictions by a flexible and privacy-preserving interpretability framework, which enables the implementation of state-of-the-art interpretable methods in a decentralized setting. Third, Falcon supports efficient data parallelism of VFL tasks and optimizes the parallelism factors to reduce the overall execution time. Falcon is fully implemented, and on which, we conduct extensive experiments using six real-world and multiple synthetic datasets. The results demonstrate that Falcon achieves comparable accuracy to non-private algorithms and outperforms three secure baselines in terms of efficiency.\n[9] Title: Obscure: Information-Theoretic Oblivious and Verifiable Aggregation Queries Text: Despite extensive research on cryptography, secure and efficient query processing over outsourced data remains an open challenge. We develop communication-efficient and information-theoretically secure algorithms for privacy-preserving aggregation queries using multi-party computation (MPC). Specifically, query processing techniques over secret-shared data outsourced by single or multiple database owners are developed. These algorithms allow a user to execute queries on the secret-shared database and also prevent the network and the (adversarial) clouds to learn the user's queries, results, or the database. We further develop (non-mandatory) privacy-preserving result verification algorithms that detect malicious behaviors, and experimentally validate the efficiency of our approach over large datasets, the size of which prior approaches to secret-sharing or MPC systems have not scaled to.\n", "keywords": " VFL frameworks, communication efficiency, multi-party settings, VFL challenges, secure multi-party computation, privacy-preserving techniques", "output": "Communication efficiency is a crucial aspect of vertical federated learning (VFL) frameworks, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of these systems. Several techniques have been developed to improve communication efficiency in VFL, including secret sharing, homomorphic encryption, and zeroth-order optimization. \n\nSecret sharing, as proposed in [3], is a technique that allows intermediate parameters to be transmitted among multiple parties without revealing the plaintexts. This approach is particularly useful in VFL settings where a trusted third-party server is not available. By combining secret sharing with homomorphic encryption, EFMVFL [3] achieves significant acceleration of the training procedure in vertical federated linear models. Another example is HashVFL [5], which integrates hashing to counter data reconstruction attacks while maintaining task performance.\n\nHomomorphic encryption is another technique used to ensure data security and privacy in VFL. However, existing industrial frameworks employing homomorphic encryption suffer from expensive computation and communication overhead, particularly in VFL settings [1]. To address this issue, researchers have proposed novel approaches, such as VERTICES [1], which presents a two-party vertical federated linear model via an efficient secret sharing scheme with a trusted coordinator. This approach achieves significant acceleration of the training procedure.\n\nZeroth-order optimization is also a desirable companion for VFL, as it can improve the model applicability of VFL frameworks, prevent privacy leakage, and support inexpensive communication and efficient computation [4]. The AsyREVEL algorithms proposed in [4] demonstrate favorable model applicability, satisfied privacy security, inexpensive communication, efficient computation, scalability, and losslessness.\n\nDespite these advancements, implementing communication efficiency techniques in multi-party settings poses several challenges. One key challenge is the need for a trusted third-party server, which can be difficult to find in real-world scenarios [3]. Another challenge is the vanishing gradients and information loss issues that arise when implementing hashing in VFL [5]. Furthermore, the complexity of modern integrated circuits necessitates collaboration between multiple distrusting parties, jeopardizing confidentiality and integrity of each party's IP [6]. Therefore, secure multi-party computation techniques, such as those proposed in [6], are essential to maintain privacy and security.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of communication efficiency techniques in VFL frameworks has been an active area of research, with various approaches proposed to address the challenges of communication efficiency and data security. However, implementing these techniques in multi-party settings remains a complex task, requiring careful consideration of the trade-offs between security, privacy, and efficiency.", "total_cost": 0}, {"final_passages": "[0] Title: Constructing Adversarial Examples for Vertical Federated Learning: Optimal Client Corruption through Multi-Armed Bandit Text: Vertical federated learning (VFL), where each participating client holds a subset of data features, has found numerous applications in finance, healthcare, and IoT systems. However, adversarial attacks, particularly through the injection of adversarial examples (AEs), pose serious challenges to the security of VFL models. In this paper, we investigate such vulnerabilities through developing a novel attack to disrupt the VFL inference process, under a practical scenario where the adversary is able to adaptively corrupt a subset of clients. We formulate the problem of finding optimal attack strategies as an online optimization problem, which is decomposed into an inner problem of adversarial example generation (AEG) and an outer problem of corruption pattern selection (CPS). Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the formulated CPS problem and a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose the Thompson sampling with Empirical maximum reward (E-TS) algorithm for the adversary to efficiently identify the optimal subset of clients for corruption. The key idea of E-TS is to introduce an estimation of the expected maximum reward for each arm, which helps to specify a small set of competitive arms, on which the exploration for the optimal arm is performed. This significantly reduces the exploration space, which otherwise can quickly become prohibitively large as the number of clients increases. We analytically characterize the regret bound of E-TS, and empirically demonstrate its capability of efficiently revealing the optimal corruption pattern with the highest attack success rate, under various datasets of popular VFL tasks.\n[1] Title: Mutual Information Regularization for Vertical Federated Learning Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is widely utilized in real-world applications to enable collaborative learning while protecting data privacy and safety. However, previous works show that parties without labels (passive parties) in VFL can infer the sensitive label information owned by the party with labels (active party) or execute backdoor attacks to VFL. Meanwhile, active party can also infer sensitive feature information from passive party. All these pose new privacy and security challenges to VFL systems. We propose a new general defense method which limits the mutual information between private raw data, including both features and labels, and intermediate outputs to achieve a better trade-off between model utility and privacy. We term this defense Mutual Information Regularization Defense (MID). We theoretically and experimentally testify the effectiveness of our MID method in defending existing attacks in VFL, including label inference attacks, backdoor attacks and feature reconstruction attacks.\n[2] Title: A Practical Clean-Label Backdoor Attack with Limited Information in Vertical Federated Learning Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) facilitates collaboration on model training among multiple parties, each owning partitioned features of the distributed dataset. Although backdoor attacks have been found as one of the main threats to FL security, research on backdoor attacks in VFL is still in the infant stage. Existing methods for VFL backdoor attacks rely on predicting sample pseudo-labels using approaches such as label inference, which require substantial additional information not readily available in practical FL scenarios. To evaluate the practical vulnerability of VFL to backdoor attacks, we present a target-efficient clean backdoor (TECB) attack for VFL. The TECB approach consists of two phases \u2013 i) Clean Backdoor Poisoning (CBP) and Target Gradient Alignment (TGA). In the CBP phase, the adversary trains a backdoor trigger and poisons the model during VFL training. The poisoned model is further fine-tuned in the TGA phase to enhance its efficacy in complex multi-classification tasks. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed TECB achieves a highly effective backdoor attack with very limited information about the target class samples, which is more practical in typical VFL settings. Experimental results verify the superior performance of TECB, achieving above 97% attack success rate (ASR) on three widely used datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and CINIC-10) with only 0.1% of target labels known, which outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods. This study uncovers the potential backdoor risks in VFL, enabling the development of secure VFL applications in areas like finance, healthcare, and beyond.

Such quittings generally do not incur serious consequences in horizontal federated learning (HFL), but they do damage to vertical federated learning (VFL), which has been underexplored in previous research. In this paper, we show that there are two major vulnerabilities when passive parties unexpectedly quit in the deployment phase of VFL \u2014 severe performance degradation and intellectual property (IP) leakage of the active party\u2019s labels. To solve these issues, we design PlugVFL to improve the VFL model\u2019s robustness against the unexpected exit of passive parties and protect the active party\u2019s IP in the deployment phase simultaneously. We evaluate our framework on multiple datasets against different inference attacks. The results show that PlugVFL effectively maintains model performance after the passive party quits and successfully disguises label information from the passive party\u2019s feature extractor, thereby mitigating IP leakage.\n[4] Title: Practical and General Backdoor Attacks against Vertical Federated Learning Text: Federated learning (FL), which aims to facilitate data collaboration across multiple organizations without exposing data privacy, encounters potential security risks. One serious threat is backdoor attacks, where an attacker injects a specific trigger into the training dataset to manipulate the model's prediction. Most existing FL backdoor attacks are based on horizontal federated learning (HFL), where the data owned by different parties have the same features. However, compared to HFL, backdoor attacks on vertical federated learning (VFL), where each party only holds a disjoint subset of features and the labels are only owned by one party, are rarely studied. The main challenge of this attack is to allow an attacker without access to the data labels, to perform an effective attack. To this end, we propose BadVFL, a novel and practical approach to inject backdoor triggers into victim models without label information. BadVFL mainly consists of two key steps. First, to address the challenge of attackers having no knowledge of labels, we introduce a SDD module that can trace data categories based on gradients. Second, we propose a SDP module that can improve the attack's effectiveness by enhancing the decision dependency between the trigger and attack target. Extensive experiments show that BadVFL supports diverse datasets and models, and achieves over 93% attack success rate with only 1% poisoning rate.\n[5] Title: Secure Vertical Federated Learning Under Unreliable Connectivity Text: Most work in privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) has focused on horizontally partitioned datasets where clients hold the same features and train complete client-level models independently. However, individual data points are often scattered across different institutions, known as clients, in vertical FL (VFL) settings. Addressing this category of FL necessitates the exchange of intermediate outputs and gradients among participants, resulting in potential privacy leakage risks and slow convergence rates. Additionally, in many real-world scenarios, VFL training also faces the acute issue of client stragglers and drop-outs, a serious challenge that can significantly hinder the training process but has been largely overlooked in existing studies. In this work, we present vFedSec, a first dropout-tolerant VFL protocol, which can support the most generalized vertical framework. It achieves secure and efficient model training by using an innovative Secure Layer alongside an embedding-padding technique. We provide theoretical proof that our design attains enhanced security while maintaining training performance. Empirical results from extensive experiments also demonstrate vFedSec is robust to client dropout and provides secure training with negligible computation and communication overhead. Compared to widely adopted homomorphic encryption (HE) methods, our approach achieves a remarkable>690x speedup and reduces communication costs significantly by>9.6x.\n[6] Title: HashVFL: Defending Against Data Reconstruction Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a trending collaborative machine learning model training solution. Existing industrial frameworks employ secure multi-party computation techniques such as homomorphic encryption to ensure data security and privacy. Despite these efforts, studies have revealed that data leakage remains a risk in VFL due to the correlations between intermediate representations and raw data. Neural networks can accurately capture these correlations, allowing an adversary to reconstruct the data. This emphasizes the need for continued research into securing VFL systems. Our work shows that hashing is a promising solution to counter data reconstruction attacks. The one-way nature of hashing makes it difficult for an adversary to recover data from hash codes. However, implementing hashing in VFL presents new challenges, including vanishing gradients and information loss. To address these issues, we propose HashVFL, which integrates hashing and simultaneously achieves learnability, bit balance, and consistency. Experimental results indicate that HashVFL effectively maintains task performance while defending against data reconstruction attacks. It also brings additional benefits in reducing the degree of label leakage, mitigating adversarial attacks, and detecting abnormal inputs. We hope our work will inspire further research into the potential applications of HashVFL.\n[7] Title: A Unified Solution for Privacy and Communication Efficiency in Vertical Federated Learning Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables multiple participants to jointly train a model on their private data without sharing it. To make VFL practical, privacy security and communication efficiency should both be satisfied. Recent research has shown that Zero-Order Optimization (ZOO) in VFL can effectively conceal the internal information of the model without adding costly privacy protective add-ons, making it a promising approach for privacy and efficiency. However, there are still two key problems that have yet to be resolved. First, the convergence rate of ZOO-based VFL is significantly slower compared to gradient-based VFL, resulting in low efficiency in model training and more communication round, which hinders its application on large neural networks. Second, although ZOO-based VFL has demonstrated resistance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks, its privacy guarantee lacks a theoretical explanation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cascaded hybrid optimization approach that employs a zeroth-order (ZO) gradient on the most critical output layer of the clients, with other parts utilizing the first-order (FO) gradient. This approach preserves the privacy protection of ZOO while significantly enhancing convergence. Moreover, we theoretically prove that applying ZOO to the VFL is equivalent to adding Gaussian Mechanism to the gradient information, which offers an implicit differential privacy guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves similar utility as the Gaussian mechanism under the same privacy budget, while also having significantly lower communication costs compared with SOTA communication-efficient VFL frameworks.\n[8] Title: Complementary Knowledge Distillation for Robust and Privacy-Preserving Model Serving in Vertical Federated Learning Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables an active party with labeled data to enhance model performance (utility) by collaborating with multiple passive parties that possess auxiliary features corresponding to the same sample identifiers (IDs). Model serving in VFL is vital for real-world, delay-sensitive applications, and it faces two major challenges: 1) robustness against arbitrarily-aligned data and stragglers; and 2) privacy protection, ensuring minimal label leakage to passive parties. Existing methods fail to transfer knowledge among parties to improve robustness in a privacy-preserving way. In this paper, we introduce a privacy-preserving knowledge transfer framework, Complementary Knowledge Distillation (CKD), designed to enhance the robustness and privacy of multi-party VFL systems. Specifically, we formulate a Complementary Label Coding (CLC) objective to encode only complementary label information of the active party's local model for passive parties to learn. Then, CKD selectively transfers the CLC-encoded complementary knowledge 1) from the passive parties to the active party, and 2) among the passive parties themselves. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that CKD outperforms existing approaches in terms of robustness against arbitrarily-aligned data, while also minimizing label privacy leakage.\n[9] Title: Hijack Vertical Federated Learning Models with Adversarial Embedding Text: Vertical federated learning (VFL) is an emerging paradigm that enables collaborators to build machine learning models together in a distributed fashion. In general, these parties have a group of users in common but own different features. Existing VFL frameworks use cryptographic techniques to provide data privacy and security guarantees, leading to a line of works studying computing efficiency and fast implementation. However, the security of VFL\u2019s model remains underexplored. On the other hand, recent years have witnessed the explosive growth of deep neural networks (DNNs) in industry. However, a line of works has revealed they are fragile to two attack vectors, i.e., adversarial and poisoning attacks, which aim to induce the model to give expected predictions of adversaries. Following this, a natural and interesting question is how harmful are these attacks to VFL? Our pre-study finds that existing attacks suffer from high performance degradation under VFL\u2019s mechanism. One important reason is that the multiparty collaboration mechanism weakens the adversary\u2019s influence on the final prediction results. After analyzing the challenges encountered by these attacks, we propose two new attacks, i.e., replay attack and generation attack , against VFL to reveal its potential risks of being maliciously manipulated by one participant. Specifically, the former searches for benign robust features in existing samples to determine the desired class, while the latter obtains them through adversarial generation. Furthermore, to avoid these features being suppressed by the features of other parties, we take the joint force of adversarial and poisoning attacks, i.e., implanting \u2018trigger-like\u2019 features in training. Finally, the adversary combines the robust features with the implanted trigger-like features to replace a target sample\u2019s features, which results in the adversary\u2019s desired prediction. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks, e.g., the adversary holding only 10% of the features can achieve an attack success rate close to\n", "keywords": " VFL systems robustness, VFL attacks, VFL evaluation challenges, VFL security enhancements", "output": "Evaluating the robustness of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) systems against various types of attacks is a challenging task, and several limitations and challenges have been identified in recent studies.

VFL has gained significant attention for its research potential and real-world applications in recent years, but still faces substantial challenges, such as in defending various kinds of data inference and backdoor attacks.

We also benchmark $11$ attacks and $8$ defenses performance under different communication and model partition settings and draw concrete insights and recommendations on the choice of defense strategies for different practical VFL deployment scenarios. \n  \n\n\n\\end{abstract}\n\n\\section{Introduction}\n\n\nThe concept of Federated Learning (FL) was first introduced by Google in 2016~\\citep{McMahan2016fl} describing a cross-device scenario where millions of mobile users collaboratively train a shared model using their local private data\nwithout centralizing these data. This scenario is regarded as Horizontal FL (HFL)~\\citep{yang2019federatedbook} as data are partitioned by sample. In another type of FL, regarded as Vertical FL (VFL)~\\citep{yang2019federatedbook}, data are partitioned by feature. VFL is often applied in industrial collaborative learning scenarios where each organization controls disjoint features of a common group of users. In VFL, local data and local model are kept private at each participant. Instead, local model outputs and their gradients are transmitted between parties.\n\nVFL has drawn increasing attention from both academic and industry in recent years with hundreds of research papers published every year and a number of open-sourced projects released, including FATE~\\citep{FATE,liu2021fate}, Fedlearner~\\citep{Fedlearner}, PaddleFL~\\citep{PaddleFL}, Pysyft~\\citep{ryffel2018generic,romanini2021pyvertical}, FedTree~\\citep{fedtree2022}, and FedML~\\citep{he2020fedml}. Real-world industrial cases are also emerged in the field of advertising~\\citep{cai2020Bytedance,tencent2021} and finance~\\citep{cheng2020federated,Cheng2022DigitalEra} etc. However, mainstream VFL projects such as FATE are industrial grade and not designed for keeping up with research advances.  %, to name a few.\n\nMeanwhile, research interests for VFL have been growing rapidly over the past years, focusing on improving various aspects of VFL protocols, such as communication efficiency~\\citep{fu2021vf2boost,liu2022fedbcd,castiglia2022compressed,fu2022towards}, robustness to attacks~\\citep{liu2021rvfr,cheng2021secureboost,li2022label,zou2022defending,zou2023mutual,sun2022label,yang2022differentially}, model utility~\\citep{li2022semi,Yitao2022multiview,feng2020multi,feng2022semisupervised}, and fair incentive designs~\\citep{liu2021achieving,qi2022fairvfl}. % are two main lines of reserach work considering VFL. \nFor communication efficiency, methods like decrease communication rounds using multiple local updates between each round~\\citep{liu2022fedbcd,fu2022towards} or compress information~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} have been proposed. As for data security and privacy, various attacks injected by one or multiple parties aiming to either steal other parties' private label~\\citep{li2022label,fu2021label,zou2022defending}, private features~\\citep{jin2021cafe,luo2021feature,li2022ressfl,jiang2022comprehensive,ye2022feature}, sensitive attributes~\\citep{Song2020Overlearning} and sample relations~\\citep{qiu2022your}, or negatively impact the model behavior~\\citep{liu2021rvfr,zou2022defending} have been put forward. Multiple defending methods have also been proposed to tackle these threats, including adding noise~\\citep{dwork2006DP,zou2022defending,li2022label}, sparsifying gradients~\\citep{aji2017sparse,fu2021label,zou2022defending}, discreting gradients~\\citep{fu2021label}, label differential privacy~\\citep{ghazi2021deep,yang2022differentially}, adding distance correlation regularizor~\\citep{sun2022label,vepakomma2019reducing}, disguising labels~\\citep{zou2022defending}, adding mutual information regularizer~\\citep{zou2023mutual}, adversarial training~\\citep{sun2021defending,li2022ressfl} or performing robust feature recovery~\\citep{liu2021rvfr}. However, each of these defenses are evaluated under specific tasks and settings, lacking of key insights and metrics on evaluating these defense strategies to defend all possible attacks in practical deployment.\n\nTo facilitate future research for VFL, we introduce a lightweight and comprehensive VFL framework, namely \\verb|VFLAIR|, which includes not only basic VFL training and inference for a variety of models and settings but also efficiency enhancement techniques and multiple defense methods that mitigate potential threats.

Only one party controls the private label information $Y$ and is referred to as \\textit{active} party while other parties are referred to as \\textit{passive} parties.\nThe active party also controls a global trainable model parameterized by $\\varphi$ (splitVFL) or global non-trainable function $F$ (aggVFL) to aggregate each party's local model output. Note in tree-based VFL the global function is an aggregation function that identifies the optimal feature split based on feature splitting information received from all parties. %The classification task is also regarded as the main task since it is the purpose for the collaboration between parties and reflects the utility of the VFL model. \nWithout loss of generality, we assume that the $K^{th}$ party is the active party while other $K-1$ parties are passive parties.\nIn the collaborative training process of NN-based VFL, each party computes its local feature embedding $H_k=G_k(X_k,\\theta_k), k=1,\\dots,K$. The active party collects $\\{H_k\\}_{k=1}^K$ and gets the final prediction $\\hat{Y}=F(H_1,\\dots,H_K, \\varphi)$. %Based on whether $F$ is a trainable model or a non-trainable function, we follow~\\citep{liu2022vertical} to categorize VFL systems into splitVFL and aggVFL separately. \nThe loss $\\mathcal{L}=\\ell(Y,\\hat{Y})$ is calculated at the active party. The gradient w.r.s. to $H_k$ as $g_k = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial H_k}, k=1,\\dots,K$ are then calculated and transmitted back to each party by the active party. Using these gradients, each party performs local model updates by SGD using $\\nabla_{\\theta_k}\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\theta_k}=\\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial H_k}\\frac{\\partial H_k}{\\partial \\theta_k}, k=1,\\dots,K$. Also the active party performs model update with SGD on global model $F$ if it is trainable using $\\nabla_{\\varphi}\\mathcal{L} = \\frac{\\partial \\mathcal{L}}{\\partial \\varphi}$. In the inference procedure, the same is done but without the backward gradient descent to get the prediction of labels. If the exchange of $H_k$ and $g_k$ is performed each round, such VFL protocol is referred as FedSGD protocol. On the other hand, if communication is done every $Q>1$ steps of local updates, such protocol is referred to as FedBCD~\\citep{liu2022fedbcd}. %{\\color{red}{Also, communication protocols that quantifies $H_k$ (using only $2^{b}$ bits for each element), or sparsifies $H_k$ by preserving only Top-k useful elements (using only $0<r<1$ proportion of the total elements), before information transmission to reduce communication cost, are referred to as Quantize~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} and Top-k~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} respectively. Further, cached FedBCD communication protocol using different batches of data for local update steps are termed CELU-VFL~\\citep{fu2022towards}.}}\n\n\n\n\n\\section{Overview of VFLAIR}\n\n\n\\textbf{Implemented Components.} An overview of the components of \\verb|VFLAIR| is shown in \\cref{fig:VFLAIR}.\n\\verb|VFLAIR| incorporates not only basic VFL training and testing process for both NN-based and tree-based VFL of various settings, but also multiple existing efficiency enhancement techniques, data leakage and model utility impairing attacks as well as defending methods that aim to mitigate potential threats. \\verb|VFLAIR| provides support for both aggVFL and splitVFL with easily adjustable model architectures. %For tree-based VFL, \\verb|VFLAIR| accommodates XGBoost and Random Forest for aggregation. \nCurrently, \\verb|VFLAIR| supports $5$ communication protocols %including FedSGD (vanilla protocol), FedBCD~\\citep{liu2022fedbcd}, CELU-VFL~\\citep{fu2022towards}, Quantize~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} and Top-k~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} \nto improve communication efficiency. Also, $11$ existing attacks and $8$ \ndefenses are supported. Moreover, \\verb|VFLAIR| supports the comprehensive assessment of defense performance using carefully designed metrics (see \\cref{sec:metrics_definition}), based on which defense strategy recommendations can be provided. Paillier Encryption~\\citep{cheng2021secureboost} is also supported to further protect transmitted results.\nIn total, $13$ datasets from  a diverse range of industrial domains, including but not limited to medical, financial, and recommendation\nare supported.\n\n\\textbf{How to use and extend.} \\verb|VFLAIR| is a light-weight and comprehensive VFL framework that can be launched on a single GPU or CPU (see \\cref{tab:hardware} for its system requirement compared to FATE). \\verb|VFLAIR| facilitates the easy integration of different datasets for model training and inference through simple dataset loading and partitioning functions. New attacks and defenses can be quickly incorporated into the framework thanks to the modular structure.  % VFL model utility and its susceptibility to attacks under various defense strategies by using $5$ carefully designed evaluation metrics. Furthermore,\n\n\n\n\\section{VFL Benchmark}\n\n\n\\subsection{VFL Settings, Models and Datasets} \nUsing \\verb|VFLAIR|, We benchmark the VFL main task performance using $13$ datasets including MNIST~\\citep{MNISTdataset}, CIFAR10~\\citep{krizhevsky2009learning}, CIFAR100~\\citep{krizhevsky2009learning}, NUSWIDE~\\citep{NUSWIDEdataset}, Breast Cancer~\\citep{street1993nuclear}, Diabetes~\\citep{Diabetes1999dataset}, Adult Income~\\citep{AdultIncome1996dataset}, Criteo~\\citep{guo2017deepfm_Criteo}, Avazu~\\citep{qu2018product_Avazu}, Cora~\\citep{mccallum2000automating_Cora}, News20~\\citep{lang1995News20},Credit~\\citep{Dua:2019} and Nursery~\\citep{Dua:2019}.\n\nWe explore $2$ distinct architectures, namely aggVFL and splitVFL, and comprehensively benchmark their performance. For global model $F$, a global softmax function is applied under aggVFL setting while a 1-layer fully-connected model serves as the global model for splitVFL setting (except for Cora dataset, for which a 1-layer graph convolution layer is applied). \nAdditionally, we investigate the impact of different communication protocols by comparing FedBCD~\\citep{liu2022fedbcd} ($Q=5$) and CELU-VFL~\\citep{fu2022towards} ($Q=5,W=5$), as well as compression mechanisms Quantize ($b=16$)~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} and Top-k ($r=0.9$)~\\citep{castiglia2022compressed} to the conventional FedSGD, as discussed in \\cref{sec:vfl_setting} and further provide insights into the communication cost reduction achieved by communication efficient protocols,\nas well as the impact of FedBCD when various attacks and defenses are deployed. % demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing efficiency.\nWe also evaluate the impact of the number of participating parties as well as the type of local model (logistic regression, tree, NN) on the main task performance of VFL. For tee-based VFL, we further benchmark both Random Forrest and XGBoost algorithms. Moreover, for \ntree-based VFL, we employ Paillier Encryption~\\citep{cheng2021secureboost} to protect transmitted information and measure its impact on computation efficiency. %such as labels and gradients. {\\color{red}{We measure the execution time along side the model performance across various tree-based VFL aggregation algorithms with and without the application of Paillier Encryption, shedding light on the execution overhead incurred by encryption.}} \n\n\n\\subsection{Attacks and Defenses} \\label{subsec:attacks}\n \n\\begin{table}[!tb]\n\\caption{Summary of attacks for NN-based VFL}\n\\label{tab:attacks}\n\\resizebox{0.998\\linewidth}{!}{\n    \\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c}\n    \\toprule\n    Attack Type & Attack & \\shortstack{Requirements\\\\/ Limitations} & \\shortstack{Attacker\\\\Party} & Attack Performance (AP) \\\\\n    \\midrule\n    \\multirow{7}{*}{\\shortstack{Label\\\\Inference\\\\(LI)}} & \\shortstack{Norm-based Scoring (NS)~\\citep{li2022label}} & \\multirow{2}{*}{\\shortstack{binary classification,\\\\sample-level}} & \\multirow{7}{*}{passive} & \\multirow{2}{*}{\\shortstack{AUC of\\\\inferred labels}}\\\\\n    \\cline{2-2}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n     & \\shortstack{Direction-based Scoring (DS)~\\citep{li2022label}} &  &  & \\\\\n    \\cline{2-3}\n    \\cline{5-5}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n     & \\shortstack{Direct Label Inference (DLI)~\\citep{li2022label,zou2022defending}} & sample-level &  & \\multirow{5}{*}{\\shortstack{ratio of correctly\\\\inferred labels\\\\ \\,}}\\\\\n    \\cline{2-3}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    & Batch-level Label Inference (BLI)~\\citep{zou2022defending} & - &  & \\\\\n    \\cline{2-3}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    & Passive Model Completion (PMC)~\\citep{fu2021label} & \\multirow{2}{*}{\\shortstack{auxiliary labeled\\\\data for each class}} &  & \\\\\n    \\cline{2-2}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    & Active Model Completion (AMC)~\\citep{fu2021label} &  &  & \\\\\n    \\cline{1-5}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    \n    \n    \\multirow{3}{*}{\\shortstack{Feature\\\\Reconstruction\\\\(FR)}} & \\shortstack{Generative Regression Network (GRN)~\\citep{luo2021feature}} & \\shortstack{black-box} & \\multirow{3}{*}{\\shortstack{active}} & \\multirow{3}{*}{\\shortstack{$1-\\text{MSE}(U_0,U_{rec})$ }}\\\\\n    \\cline{2-3}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n     & \\shortstack{Training-based Back Mapping by\\\\model inversion (TBM)~\\citep{li2022ressfl}} & \\shortstack{white-box,\\\\auxiliary i.i.d. data} &  & \\\\\n    \\cline{1-5}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    \\shortstack{Targeted\\\\Backdoor (TB)\\\\ \\,} & \\shortstack{Label Replacement\\\\Backdoor (LRB)~\\citep{zou2022defending}} & \\shortstack{$\\geq1$ sample of\\\\target class} & \\shortstack{passive\\\\ \\,\\\\ \\,} & \\shortstack{ratio of triggered samples\\\\inferred as target class}\\\\\n    \\cline{1-5}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n    \\multirow{2}{*}{\\shortstack{Non-targeted\\\\Backdoor (NTB)}} & Noisy-sample Backdoor (NSB)~\\citep{zou2023mutual} & - & \\multirow{2}{*}{passive} & \\multirow{2}{*}{\\shortstack{MP difference between total\\\\and noisy/missing samples}}\\\\\n    \\cline{2-3}\n    \\\\[-1em]\n     & Missing Feature (MF)~\\citep{liu2021rvfr} & - &  & \\\\\n    \\bottomrule\n    \\end{tabular}\n}\n\\end{table}\n\nWe benchmark the performance of $11$ attacks with $8$ defenses on $3$ datasets including MNIST~\\citep{MNISTdataset}, CIFAR10~\\citep{krizhevsky2009learning} and NUSWIDE~\\citep{NUSWIDEdataset}.\nFor these evaluations, we mainly consider a VFL setting with $1$ active party and $1$ passive party following original works~\\citep{li2022label,luo2021feature,li2022ressfl}, denoted as party $a,p$ respectively, with each party owning their local feature $X_a, X_p$ and local model $G_a, G_p$.\nThe local model output of the active and passive party are denoted as $H_a, H_p$ respectively.\nWe summarized the evaluated attacks in \\cref{tab:attacks}.

Execution Time (Exec.Time) is used to measure computation efficiency. \n\n\\textbf{Attack Performance (AP).} %As we also include various kinds of attacks and defense in our platform and benchmark experiments, we define AP so as to evaluate the success rate of a given attack which also reflects the vulnerability of a VFL system to that given attack. \nThe definition of AP varies with respect to the type of the attack and is summarized in \\cref{tab:attacks}. \n\n\\textbf{Defense Capability Score (DCS).} %To evaluate the defense methods, \nIntuitively, an ideal defense should not compromise the utility of the original main task and should thwart the attack completely. Therefore, considering that both AP and MP are key metrics to evaluate defenses. We further propose \\textbf{Defense Capability Score (DCS)}, to directly compare all the defenses under one unified metric. Let $df=(\\text{AP},\\text{MP})$ represents the performance of a defense on an AP-MP graph, then we define its defense capability score (DCS) based on the distance between $df$ to an ideal defense $df^{*}=(\\text{AP}^{*}, \\text{MP}^{*})$.  MP$^{*}$ is the MP of VFL without defense and AP$^{*}$ is set to $0.0$ representing the performance of a completely incapable attacker. Then, we formulate the definition of DCS as:\n\\begin{equation} \\label{eq:dcs}\n \\setlength\\abovedisplayskip{0.05cm}\n \\setlength\\belowdisplayskip{0.05cm}\n    \\text{DCS} = \\frac{1}{1+D(df,df^{*})} = \\frac{1}{1+\\sqrt{(1-\\beta)(\\text{AP}-\\text{AP}^{*})^2+\\beta(\\text{MP}-\\text{MP}^{*})^2}},\n\\end{equation}\n\n\\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.36\\textwidth}\n    \\centering\n    \\includegraphics[width=0.99\\linewidth]{figures/score/DCS_LI_v4.pdf}\n    \\caption{A visual illustration example of DCS.

Next, I will not stop my thinking, and I will conduct a detailed analysis of the entire paper:\n\n\\boxed_analysis{\nThis paper introduces VFLAIR, a novel framework and benchmark designed for Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). The core motivation stems from the observation that while VFL is increasingly relevant in industrial applications, existing frameworks are often cumbersome and lack the flexibility needed for cutting-edge research. This gap hinders the systematic evaluation of novel VFL techniques, particularly concerning security and efficiency. The authors aim to address this by providing a lightweight, modular platform that supports a wide range of VFL configurations, attack scenarios, and defense mechanisms. This is a significant contribution, as the field of federated learning has evolved from its initial focus on horizontal data partitioning to address the more common real-world scenario of vertical partitioning. Early VFL approaches were often bespoke and lacked standardization, making comparisons difficult. The increasing research activity in VFL, focusing on communication efficiency and robustness against attacks, underscores the need for a comprehensive benchmark like VFLAIR. \n\nThe central problem addressed by this work is the absence of a unified platform for VFL research. This lack of a standardized environment makes it difficult to compare different methods and track progress. The authors rightly emphasize the importance of addressing security vulnerabilities in VFL, particularly the susceptibility to data inference and backdoor attacks. The real-world implications are substantial, as the adoption of VFL in sensitive domains like finance and healthcare necessitates robust security guarantees. The conceptual framework of VFLAIR is built around modularity and extensibility, allowing researchers to easily experiment with different model architectures, communication protocols, and defense strategies. This modular design is a key strength, enabling the systematic exploration of the VFL design space. However, it is worth noting that the framework's focus on specific types of attacks and defenses might be a limitation, potentially overlooking other emerging threats.\n\nThe methodology centers on the design and implementation of the VFLAIR framework. The modular design, with distinct components for datasets, local models, global models, communication protocols, and defense methods, is a sound approach. The choice of supporting both aggregation-based (aggVFL) and split-based (splitVFL) models provides flexibility. The inclusion of various communication protocols, such as FedSGD, FedBCD, CELU-VFL, Quantize, and Top-k, allows for evaluating the trade-offs between communication efficiency and model performance. The selection of eleven attacks and eight defense methods demonstrates a commitment to comprehensive security evaluation. The introduction of new evaluation metrics, such as Defense Capability Score (DCS), Type-level DCS (T-DCS), and Comprehensive DCS (C-DCS), is crucial for quantifying the effectiveness of different defense strategies. However, the specific design choices within each module could be further explored for potential biases or limitations. For example, the specific implementation of gradient compression in the Top-k protocol might influence its performance. \n\nThe experimental design involves benchmarking VFL main task performance and evaluating the effectiveness of attacks and defenses. The choice of datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR10, NUSWIDE, and several real-world datasets, provides a diverse set of evaluation scenarios. The use of multiple local model architectures and global models allows for assessing the framework's versatility. The metrics used, such as Main Task Performance (MP), Attack Performance (AP), number of communication rounds, amount of data transferred, and execution time, are appropriate for evaluating both utility and security. The experiments on attack and defense performance, conducted on MNIST, CIFAR10, and NUSWIDE, systematically evaluate the trade-offs between model utility and defense effectiveness. The use of the DCS metrics provides a unified way to compare different defense strategies. However, the specific hyperparameter settings for the attacks and defenses could be a confounding factor. Alternative experimental designs could involve more complex, real-world datasets or a greater number of participating parties. The statistical validity of the results depends on the number of trials and the variance of the observed metrics.\n\nThe results indicate that splitVFL generally achieves comparable or slightly higher MP than aggVFL, potentially due to the additional trainable layer in the global model. The finding that FedBCD and CELU-VFL achieve comparable MP with fewer communication rounds than FedSGD highlights their efficiency. The significant increase in execution time with Paillier Encryption underscores the computational cost of security measures. The observation that increasing the number of participants slightly lowers MP suggests the challenges of multi-party collaboration. The results also demonstrate that certain attacks, like DS and DLI, are particularly effective, emphasizing the need for robust defenses. The trade-offs between MP and AP observed when applying defenses are expected. The consistency of DCS rankings across datasets suggests the robustness of the proposed metrics. The finding that splitVFL is less vulnerable to attacks than aggVFL, and that FedBCD is less vulnerable than FedSGD, provides valuable insights for practical VFL deployment. However, alternative interpretations of the results might focus on the specific conditions under which these findings hold. The strength of the evidence depends on the statistical significance of the observed differences. The generalizability of these findings to other VFL settings and datasets needs further investigation.\n\nIn summary, VFLAIR provides a valuable tool for researchers to systematically explore the design space of VFL and evaluate the effectiveness of different defense strategies. The framework bridges the gap between industrial-grade VFL systems and research-focused platforms. The proposed DCS metrics offer a unified way to assess defense performance. Future research directions include extending the framework to support more complex VFL scenarios, incorporating additional attack and defense mechanisms, and developing more sophisticated evaluation metrics. The practical applications of VFLAIR lie in facilitating the development of more secure and efficient VFL systems for real-world collaborative learning tasks. The societal impact of this work is potentially significant, as it contributes to the development of privacy-preserving machine learning techniques. Long-term implications include the acceleration of VFL research and the development of more robust and trustworthy collaborative learning systems.\n\nCritically, several limitations of the paper and the VFLAIR framework can be identified. The framework, while comprehensive, might not cover all possible VFL architectures, communication protocols, or attack/defense mechanisms. The theoretical underpinnings of the proposed DCS metrics could be further elaborated. Methodologically, the choice of specific attacks and defenses might introduce bias. The hyperparameter settings for these methods could significantly impact the results. The framework's reliance on specific datasets might limit the generalizability of the findings. Experimentally, the number of participating parties in some experiments might be limited. The computational resources required to run all the experiments could be a barrier for some researchers. The statistical significance of some of the observed differences might need further investigation. Practically, the framework's usability and ease of integration with existing research workflows could be improved. The computational overhead of certain security mechanisms, like Paillier Encryption, needs to be carefully considered in practical deployments. To enhance the theoretical foundations, future work could explore formal privacy guarantees for the implemented defense mechanisms. Methodological improvements could involve developing adaptive attack and defense strategies. Experimental refinements could include more extensive hyperparameter tuning and the use of larger and more diverse datasets. Practical enhancements could focus on developing a user-friendly interface and providing clear guidelines for using the framework. Theoretical extensions could involve incorporating differential privacy or secure multi-party computation techniques directly into the framework. Algorithm improvements could focus on developing more efficient communication protocols or robust defense mechanisms. New application domains for VFLAIR could include healthcare, finance, and IoT. Integration possibilities include combining VFLAIR with existing federated learning platforms. Performance optimizations could focus on reducing the computational overhead of the framework. Scalability enhancements could address the challenges of deploying VFL with a large number of participants.}\n\nNow, please tell me the answers to the three questions from the recent search."}, {"role": "user", "content": "## Question 1\n\nWhat are the primary technical approaches used in existing Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) frameworks to ensure data privacy and security, and how have these evolved over the past five years?\n\n### Passage\n\n[0] Title: Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning Framework with General Aggregation and Multiparty Entity Matching **--**Text: The requirement for data sharing and privacy has brought increasing attention to federated learning. However, the existing aggregation models are too specialized and deal less with users\u2019 withdrawal issue. Moreover, protocols for multiparty entity matching are rarely covered. Thus, there is no systematic framework to perform federated learning tasks. In this paper, we systematically propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework (PFLF) where we first construct a general secure aggregation model in federated learning scenarios by combining the Shamir secret sharing with homomorphic cryptography to ensure that the aggregated value can be decrypted correctly only when the number of participants is greater than \n \n t\n \n . Furthermore, we propose a multiparty entity matching protocol by employing secure multiparty computing to solve the entity alignment problems and a logistic regression algorithm to achieve privacy-preserving model training and support the withdrawal of users in vertical federated learning (VFL) scenarios. Finally, the security analyses prove that PFLF preserves the data privacy in the honest-but-curious model, and the experimental evaluations show PFLF attains consistent accuracy with the original model and demonstrates the practical feasibility.\n[1] Title: Mutual Information Regularization for Vertical Federated Learning **--**Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is widely utilized in real-world applications to enable collaborative learning while protecting data privacy and safety. However, previous works show that parties without labels (passive parties) in VFL can infer the sensitive label information owned by the party with labels (active party) or execute backdoor attacks to VFL. Meanwhile, active party can also infer sensitive feature information from passive party. All these pose new privacy and security challenges to VFL systems. We propose a new general defense method which limits the mutual information between private raw data, including both features and labels, and intermediate outputs to achieve a better trade-off between model utility and privacy. We term this defense Mutual Information Regularization Defense (MID). We theoretically and experimentally testify the effectiveness of our MID method in defending existing attacks in VFL, including label inference attacks, backdoor attacks and feature reconstruction attacks.\n[2] Title: Approaching Expressive and Secure Vertical Federated Learning With Embedding Alignment in Intelligent IoT Systems **--**Text: In the context of vertical federated learning (VFL), agents utilize multimodal data on their edge devices to corporately train and inference with the deep learning models. However, in classical VFL, there exists three problems from the perspective of embeddings. 1) the utilization of oversimplified embedding fusion mechanism may result in suboptimal performance of the models; 2) the exchange of embeddings and their gradients poses a potential risk of private information leakage, as they inherently contain sensitive information; 3) finally, the withdrawal of some agents from cooperation disrupts the collaborative inference capabilities of the remaining agents. To mitigate these problems, this article introduces a novel VFL algorithm grounded in embedding alignment. It includes two distinct schemes: 1) performance-oriented scheme (POS) and 2) privacy-respecting scheme (PRS). Within POS, this article employs contrastive loss and joint fine-tuning to augment the expressiveness and the overall performance of models. While the PRS incorporates homomorphic-encryption-based contrastive loss and individual fine-tuning to safeguard the data security. In addition, the PRS eliminates the necessity of collaborative inference. In this article, comprehensive security analysis and proofs are conducted for PRS. Moreover, experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed POS over classical VFL, showcasing a substantial performance improvement. Simultaneously, the PRS surpasses the performance of training alone, even under stringent security constraints.\n[3] Title: A Unified Solution for Privacy and Communication Efficiency in Vertical Federated Learning **--**Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables multiple participants to jointly train a model on their private data without sharing it. To make VFL practical, privacy security and communication efficiency should both be satisfied. Recent research has shown that Zero-Order Optimization (ZOO) in VFL can effectively conceal the internal information of the model without adding costly privacy protective add-ons, making it a promising approach for privacy and efficiency. However, there are still two key problems that have yet to be resolved. First, the convergence rate of ZOO-based VFL is significantly slower compared to gradient-based VFL, resulting in low efficiency in model training and more communication round, which hinders its application on large neural networks. Second, although ZOO-based VFL has demonstrated resistance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks, its privacy guarantee lacks a theoretical explanation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cascaded hybrid optimization approach that employs a zeroth-order (ZO) gradient on the most critical output layer of the clients, with other parts utilizing the first-order (FO) gradient. This approach preserves the privacy protection of ZOO while significantly enhancing convergence. Moreover, we theoretically prove that applying ZOO to the VFL is equivalent to adding Gaussian Mechanism to the gradient information, which offers an implicit differential privacy guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves similar utility as the Gaussian mechanism under the same privacy budget, while also having significantly lower communication costs compared with SOTA communication-efficient VFL frameworks.\n[4] Title: Secure Vertical Federated Learning Under Unreliable Connectivity **--**Text: Most work in privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) has focused on horizontally partitioned datasets where clients hold the same features and train complete client-level models independently. However, individual data points are often scattered across different institutions, known as clients, in vertical FL (VFL) settings. Addressing this category of FL necessitates the exchange of intermediate outputs and gradients among participants, resulting in potential privacy leakage risks and slow convergence rates. Additionally, in many real-world scenarios, VFL training also faces the acute issue of client stragglers and drop-outs, a serious challenge that can significantly hinder the training process but has been largely overlooked in existing studies. In this work, we present vFedSec, a first dropout-tolerant VFL protocol, which can support the most generalized vertical framework. It achieves secure and efficient model training by using an innovative Secure Layer alongside an embedding-padding technique. We provide theoretical proof that our design attains enhanced security while maintaining training performance. Empirical results from extensive experiments also demonstrate vFedSec is robust to client dropout and provides secure training with negligible computation and communication overhead. Compared to widely adopted homomorphic encryption (HE) methods, our approach achieves a remarkable>690x speedup and reduces communication costs significantly by>9.6x.\n[5] Title: Privacy-Preserving Vertical Federated Logistic Regression without Trusted Third-Party Coordinator **--**Text: Federated learning is a new distributed learning paradigm, which allows multiple parties to cooperatively train a centralized model without sharing their data. In this paper, a privacy-preserving logistic regression (LR) training algorithm for vertical federated learning (VFL) is proposed. First, this paper analyzes the related works and point out the privacy leakage risks. Then, based on the mini-batch SGD and parameter encryption method, a secure VFL model training scheme for LR without the assistance of a trusted third-party is designed. Next, to protect the privacy of model parameters, a differentially-private algorithm and comprehensive privacy analysis are provided. Finally, experiments show that the algorithm not only guarantees the security and privacy, but also ensures the model utility.\n[6] Title: Efficient and Privacy-Preserving Feature Importance-Based Vertical Federated Learning **--**Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables multiple data owners, each holding a different subset of features about a largely overlapping set of data samples, to collaboratively train a global model. The quality of data owners\u2019 local features affects the performance of the VFL model, which makes feature selection vitally important. However, existing feature selection methods for VFL either assume the availability of prior knowledge on the number of noisy features or prior knowledge on the post-training threshold of useful features to be selected, making them unsuitable for practical applications. To bridge this gap, we propose the Federated Stochastic Dual-Gate based Feature Selection (FedSDG-FS) approach. It consists of a Gaussian stochastic dual-gate to efficiently approximate the probability of a feature being selected. FedSDG-FS further designs a local embedding perturbation approach to achieve differential privacy for local training data. To reduce overhead, we propose a feature importance initialization method based on Gini impurity, which can accomplish its goals with only two parameter transmissions between the server and the clients. The enhanced version, FedSDG-FS++, protects the privacy for both the clients\u2019 training data and the server's labels through Partially Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) without relying on a trusted third-party. Theoretically, we analyze the convergence rate, privacy guarantees and security analysis of our methods. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that FedSDG-FS and FedSDG-FS++ significantly outperform existing approaches in terms of achieving more accurate selection of high-quality features as well as improving VFL performance in a privacy-preserving manner.\n[7] Title: FEVERLESS: Fast and Secure Vertical Federated Learning Based on XGBoost for Decentralized Labels **--**Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model over vertically partitioned data without leaking private local information. Tree-based models, like XGBoost and LightGBM, have been widely used in VFL to enhance the interpretation and efficiency of training. However, there is a fundamental lack of research on how to conduct VFL securely over distributed labels. This work is the first to fill this gap by designing a novel protocol, called FEVERLESS, based on XGBoost. FEVERLESS leverages secure aggregation via information masking technique and global differential privacy provided by a fairly and randomly selected noise leader to prevent private information from being leaked in the training process. Furthermore, it provides label and data privacy against honest-but-curious adversaries even in the case of collusion of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n- 2$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"wang-ieq1-3227326.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> out of <inline-formula><tex-math notation=\"LaTeX\">$n$</tex-math><alternatives><mml:math><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math><inline-graphic xlink:href=\"wang-ieq2-3227326.gif\"/></alternatives></inline-formula> clients. We present a comprehensive security and efficiency analysis for our design, and the empirical results from our experiments demonstrate that FEVERLESS is fast and secure. In particular, it outperforms the solution based on additive homomorphic encryption in runtime cost and provides better accuracy than the local differential privacy approach.\n[8] Title: FLSG: A Novel Defense Strategy Against Inference Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning **--**Text: As a new machine learning (ML) paradigm, federated learning (FL) empowers different participants to jointly train a more effective model than traditional ML. Unlike horizontal FL (HFL), which expands the sample space by aggregating local models, vertical FL (VFL) is suitable for scenarios where the sample ID between participants is the same but differs in sample characteristics. For a long time, VFL has been considered safe due to no data exchange and heterogeneity between parties. However, the recently proposed label inference attacks pose a significant security threat to VFL. Specifically, by adding randomly initialized layers to the top of local models, the passive label inference attack can infer tens of thousands of local participants\u2019 private data with only 40 auxiliary labels. Since the attack is entirely local, using privacy protection technologies such as differential privacy cannot effectively defend against these attacks. Therefore, we propose a new privacy protection scheme called FL similar gradients (FLSGs) to defend against this attack. Unlike differential privacy, the FLSG scheme randomly generates gradients of a Gaussian distribution similar in dimension to the original gradients and calculates their cosine distance. If the distance is less than a certain threshold, the gradients are used instead of the original gradients to pass to the local participants. We conducted extensive evaluations on six real-world data sets, and the results show that FLSG provides a better defensive effect at lower computational overhead than other known methods when defending the passive label inference attack.\n[9] Title: Secure Forward Aggregation for Vertical Federated Neural Networks **--**Text: Vertical federated learning (VFL) is attracting much attention because it enables cross-silo data cooperation in a privacy-preserving manner. While most research works in VFL focus on linear and tree models, deep models (e.g., neural networks) are not well studied in VFL. In this paper, we focus on SplitNN, a well-known neural network framework in VFL, and identify a trade-off between data security and model performance in SplitNN. Briefly, SplitNN trains the model by exchanging gradients and transformed data. On the one hand, SplitNN suffers from the loss of model performance since multiply parties jointly train the model using transformed data instead of raw data, and a large amount of low-level feature information is discarded. On the other hand, a naive solution of increasing the model performance through aggregating at lower layers in SplitNN (i.e., the data is less transformed and more low-level feature is preserved) makes raw data vulnerable to inference attacks. To mitigate the above trade-off, we propose a new neural network protocol in VFL called Security Forward Aggregation (SFA). It changes the way of aggregating the transformed data and adopts removable masks to protect the raw data. Experiment results show that networks with SFA achieve both data security and high model performance.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nOver the past five years, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) frameworks have employed various technical approaches to ensure data privacy and security. These approaches can be broadly categorized into three main categories: secure aggregation, privacy-preserving algorithms, and secure multiparty computation.\n\nSecure aggregation is a technique used to protect the privacy of individual data points by aggregating the gradients or intermediate results in a way that prevents the disclosure of sensitive information. In [0], a privacy-preserving federated learning framework (PFLF) is proposed, which combines Shamir secret sharing with homomorphic cryptography to ensure that the aggregated value can be decrypted correctly only when the number of participants is greater than t. Another approach is the use of zero-order optimization (ZOO) in VFL, which effectively conceals the internal information of the model without adding costly privacy protective add-ons [3]. However, the convergence rate of ZOO-based VFL is significantly slower compared to gradient-based VFL, resulting in low efficiency in model training and more communication rounds.\n\nPrivacy-preserving algorithms are used to protect the privacy of individual data points by limiting the mutual information between private raw data and intermediate outputs [1]. Mutual Information Regularization Defense (MID) is a defense method that limits the mutual information between private raw data, including both features and labels, and intermediate outputs to achieve a better trade-off between model utility and privacy. Another approach is the use of embedding alignment in VFL, which employs contrastive loss and joint fine-tuning to augment the expressiveness and overall performance of models, while incorporating homomorphic-encryption-based contrastive loss and individual fine-tuning to safeguard the data security [2].\n\nSecure multiparty computation is a technique used to enable secure computation on private data without revealing the data itself. In [4], a novel VFL protocol, vFedSec, is proposed, which uses an innovative Secure Layer alongside an embedding-padding technique to achieve secure and efficient model training. The protocol provides theoretical proof that it attains enhanced security while maintaining training performance. In [5], a privacy-preserving logistic regression training algorithm for VFL is proposed, which uses parameter encryption and differentially-private algorithms to protect the privacy of model parameters. In [6], a feature importance-based VFL approach is proposed, which uses a Gaussian stochastic dual-gate to efficiently approximate the probability of a feature being selected and achieves differential privacy for local training data.\n\nIn addition, some recent works have focused on addressing the issue of client stragglers and drop-outs in VFL. In [4], a dropout-tolerant VFL protocol is proposed, which can support the most generalized vertical framework and achieves secure and efficient model training. In [7], a novel protocol, FEVERLESS, is proposed, which leverages secure aggregation via information masking technique and global differential privacy provided by a fairly and randomly selected noise leader to prevent private information from being leaked in the training process.\n\nIn summary, the primary technical approaches used in existing VFL frameworks to ensure data privacy and security include secure aggregation, privacy-preserving algorithms, and secure multiparty computation. These approaches have evolved over the past five years to address various challenges, including the trade-off between data security and model performance, the issue of client stragglers and drop-outs, and the need for efficient and practical solutions.\n\n**********\n\n## Question 2\n\nHow have the communication efficiency techniques in VFL frameworks been developed and what are the key challenges in implementing these techniques in multi-party settings?\n\n### Passage\n\n[0] Title: SEPIA: Privacy-Preserving Aggregation of Multi-Domain Network Events and Statistics **--**Text: Secure multiparty computation (MPC) allows joint privacy-preserving computations on data of multiple parties. Although MPC has been studied substantially, building solutions that are practical in terms of computation and communication cost is still a major challenge. In this paper, we investigate the practical usefulness of MPC for multi-domain network security and monitoring. We first optimize MPC comparison operations for processing high volume data in near real-time. We then design privacy-preserving protocols for event correlation and aggregation of network traffic statistics, such as addition of volume metrics, computation of feature entropy, and distinct item count. Optimizing performance of parallel invocations, we implement our protocols along with a complete set of basic operations in a library called SEPIA. We evaluate the running time and bandwidth requirements of our protocols in realistic settings on a local cluster as well as on PlanetLab and show that they work in near real-time for up to 140 input providers and 9 computation nodes. Compared to implementations using existing general-purpose MPC frameworks, our protocols are significantly faster, requiring, for example, 3 minutes for a task that takes 2 days with general-purpose frameworks. This improvement paves the way for new applications of MPC in the area of networking. Finally, we run SEPIA's protocols on real traffic traces of 17 networks and show how they provide new possibilities for distributed troubleshooting and early anomaly detection.\n[1] Title: VERTICES: Efficient Two-Party Vertical Federated Linear Model with TTP-aided Secret Sharing **--**Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) has emerged as one of the most predominant approaches for secure collaborative machine learning where the training data is partitioned by features among multiple parties. Most VFL algorithms primarily rely on two fundamental privacy-preserving techniques: Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC). Though generally considered with stronger privacy guarantees, existing general-purpose MPC frameworks suffer from expensive computation and communication overhead and are inefficient especially under VFL settings. This study centers around MPC-based VFL algorithms and presents a novel approach for two-party vertical federated linear models via an efficient secret sharing (SS) scheme with a trusted coordinator. Our approach can achieve significant acceleration of the training procedure in vertical federated linear models of between 2.5x and 6.6x than other existing MPC frameworks under the same security setting.\n[2] Title: Hybrid Differentially Private Federated Learning on Vertically Partitioned Data **--**Text: We present HDP-VFL, the first hybrid differentially private (DP) framework for vertical federated learning (VFL) to demonstrate that it is possible to jointly learn a generalized linear model (GLM) from vertically partitioned data with only a negligible cost, w.r.t. training time, accuracy, etc., comparing to idealized non-private VFL. Our work builds on the recent advances in VFL-based collaborative training among different organizations which rely on protocols like Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Secure Multi-Party Computation (MPC) to secure computation and training. In particular, we analyze how VFL's intermediate result (IR) can leak private information of the training data during communication and design a DP-based privacy-preserving algorithm to ensure the data confidentiality of VFL participants. We mathematically prove that our algorithm not only provides utility guarantees for VFL, but also offers multi-level privacy, i.e. DP w.r.t. IR and joint differential privacy (JDP) w.r.t. model weights. Experimental results demonstrate that our work, under adequate privacy budgets, is quantitatively and qualitatively similar to GLMs, learned in idealized non-private VFL setting, rather than the increased cost in memory and processing time in most prior works based on HE or MPC. Our codes will be released if this paper is accepted.\n[3] Title: EFMVFL: An Efficient and Flexible Multi-party Vertical Federated Learning without a Third Party **--**Text: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning setting which allows multiple participants collaboratively to train a model under the orchestration of a server without disclosing their local data. Vertical federated learning (VFL) is a special structure in FL. It handles the situation where participants have the same ID space but different feature spaces. In order to guarantee the security and privacy of the local data of each participant, homomorphic encryption (HE) is often used to transmit intermediate parameters or data during the training process. In most VFL frameworks, a trusted third-party server is necessary because the plaintexts of the parameters need to be revealed for the computation. However, it is hard to find such a credible entity in the real world. Existing methods for solving this problem are either communication-intensive or unsuitable for multi-party scenarios. By combining secret sharing (SS) and HE, we propose a novel VFL framework without any trusted third parties called EFMVFL. It allows intermediate parameters to be transmitted among multiple parties without revealing the plaintexts. EFMVFL is applicable to generalized linear models (GLMs) and supports flexible expansion to multiple participants. Extensive experiments under Logistic Regression and Poisson Regression show that our framework is outstanding in communication (reduced by 3.2\u00d7\u2013 6.8\u00d7) and efficiency (accelerated by 1.6\u00d7\u2013 3.1\u00d7).\n[4] Title: Desirable Companion for Vertical Federated Learning: New Zeroth-Order Gradient Based Algorithm **--**Text: Vertical federated learning (VFL) attracts increasing attention due to the emerging demands of multi-party collaborative modeling and concerns of privacy leakage. A complete list of metrics to evaluate VFL algorithms should include model applicability, privacy security, communication cost, and computation efficiency, where privacy security is especially important to VFL. However, to the best of our knowledge, there does not exist a VFL algorithm satisfying all these criteria very well. To address this challenging problem, in this paper, we reveal that zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is a desirable companion for VFL. Specifically, ZOO can 1) improve the model applicability of VFL framework, 2) prevent VFL framework from privacy leakage under curious, colluding, and malicious threat models, 3) support inexpensive communication and efficient computation. Based on that, we propose a novel and practical VFL framework with black-box models, which is inseparably interconnected to the promising properties of ZOO. We believe that it takes one stride towards designing a practical VFL framework matching all the criteria. Under this framework, we raise two novel asynchronous zeroth-order algorithms for vertical federated learning (AsyREVEL) with different smoothing techniques. We theoretically drive the convergence rates of AsyREVEL algorithms under nonconvex condition. More importantly, we prove the privacy security of our proposed framework under existing VFL attacks on different levels. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the favorable model applicability, satisfied privacy security, inexpensive communication, efficient computation, scalability and losslessness of our framework.\n[5] Title: HashVFL: Defending Against Data Reconstruction Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning **--**Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a trending collaborative machine learning model training solution. Existing industrial frameworks employ secure multi-party computation techniques such as homomorphic encryption to ensure data security and privacy. Despite these efforts, studies have revealed that data leakage remains a risk in VFL due to the correlations between intermediate representations and raw data. Neural networks can accurately capture these correlations, allowing an adversary to reconstruct the data. This emphasizes the need for continued research into securing VFL systems. Our work shows that hashing is a promising solution to counter data reconstruction attacks. The one-way nature of hashing makes it difficult for an adversary to recover data from hash codes. However, implementing hashing in VFL presents new challenges, including vanishing gradients and information loss. To address these issues, we propose HashVFL, which integrates hashing and simultaneously achieves learnability, bit balance, and consistency. Experimental results indicate that HashVFL effectively maintains task performance while defending against data reconstruction attacks. It also brings additional benefits in reducing the degree of label leakage, mitigating adversarial attacks, and detecting abnormal inputs. We hope our work will inspire further research into the potential applications of HashVFL.\n[6] Title: Garbled EDA: Privacy Preserving Electronic Design Automation **--**Text: The complexity of modern integrated circuits (ICs) necessitates collaboration between multiple distrusting parties, including third-party intellectual property (3PIP) vendors, design houses, CAD/EDA tool vendors, and foundries, which jeopardizes confidentiality and integrity of each party\u2019s IP. IP protection standards and the existing techniques proposed by researchers are ad hoc and vulnerable to numerous structural, functional, and/or side-channel attacks. Our framework, Garbled EDA, proposes an alternative direction through formulating the problem in a secure multi-party computation setting, where the privacy of IPs, CAD tools, and process design kits (PDKs) is maintained. As a proof-of-concept, Garbled EDA is evaluated in the context of simulation, where multiple IP description formats (Verilog, C, S) are supported. Our results demonstrate a reasonable logical-resource cost and negligible memory overhead. To further reduce the overhead, we present another efficient implementation methodology, feasible when the resource utilization is a bottleneck, but the communication between two parties is not restricted. Interestingly, this implementation is private and secure even in the presence of malicious adversaries attempting to, e.g., gain access to PDKs or in-house IPs of the CAD tool providers.\n[7] Title: MMVFL: A Simple Vertical Federated Learning Framework for Multi-Class Multi-Participant Scenarios **--**Text: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving collective machine learning paradigm. Vertical federated learning (VFL) deals with the case where participants share the same sample ID space but have different feature spaces, while label information is owned by one participant. Early studies of VFL supported two participants and focused on binary-class logistic regression problems, while recent studies have put more attention on specific aspects such as communication efficiency and data security. In this paper, we propose the multi-participant multi-class vertical federated learning (MMVFL) framework for multi-class VFL problems involving multiple parties. By extending the idea of multi-view learning (MVL), MMVFL enables label sharing from its owner to other VFL participants in a privacy-preserving manner. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MMVFL, a feature selection scheme is incorporated into MMVFL to compare its performance against supervised feature selection and MVL-based approaches. The proposed framework is capable of quantifying feature importance and measuring participant contributions. It is also simple and easy to combine with other communication and security techniques. The experiment results on feature selection for classification tasks on real-world datasets show that MMVFL can effectively share label information among multiple VFL participants and match the multi-class classification performance of existing approaches.\n[8] Title: Falcon: A Privacy-Preserving and Interpretable Vertical Federated Learning System **--**Text: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple data owners to collaboratively train machine learning (ML) models without disclosing their raw data. In the vertical federated learning (VFL) setting, the collaborating parties have data from the same set of users but with disjoint attributes. After constructing the VFL models, the parties deploy the models in production systems to infer prediction requests. In practice, the prediction output itself may not be convincing for party users to make the decisions, especially in high-stakes applications. Model interpretability is therefore essential to provide meaningful insights and better comprehension on the prediction output.\n In this paper, we propose Falcon, a novel privacy-preserving and interpretable VFL system. First, Falcon supports VFL training and prediction with strong and efficient privacy protection for a wide range of ML models, including linear regression, logistic regression, and multi-layer perceptron. The protection is achieved by a hybrid strategy of threshold partially homomorphic encryption (PHE) and additive secret sharing scheme (SSS), ensuring no intermediate information disclosure. Second, Falcon facilitates understanding of VFL model predictions by a flexible and privacy-preserving interpretability framework, which enables the implementation of state-of-the-art interpretable methods in a decentralized setting. Third, Falcon supports efficient data parallelism of VFL tasks and optimizes the parallelism factors to reduce the overall execution time. Falcon is fully implemented, and on which, we conduct extensive experiments using six real-world and multiple synthetic datasets. The results demonstrate that Falcon achieves comparable accuracy to non-private algorithms and outperforms three secure baselines in terms of efficiency.\n[9] Title: Obscure: Information-Theoretic Oblivious and Verifiable Aggregation Queries **--**Text: Despite extensive research on cryptography, secure and efficient query processing over outsourced data remains an open challenge. We develop communication-efficient and information-theoretically secure algorithms for privacy-preserving aggregation queries using multi-party computation (MPC). Specifically, query processing techniques over secret-shared data outsourced by single or multiple database owners are developed. These algorithms allow a user to execute queries on the secret-shared database and also prevent the network and the (adversarial) clouds to learn the user's queries, results, or the database. We further develop (non-mandatory) privacy-preserving result verification algorithms that detect malicious behaviors, and experimentally validate the efficiency of our approach over large datasets, the size of which prior approaches to secret-sharing or MPC systems have not scaled to.\n\n\n### Answer\n\nCommunication efficiency is a crucial aspect of vertical federated learning (VFL) frameworks, as it directly impacts the performance and scalability of these systems. Several techniques have been developed to improve communication efficiency in VFL, including secret sharing, homomorphic encryption, and zeroth-order optimization. \n\nSecret sharing, as proposed in [3], is a technique that allows intermediate parameters to be transmitted among multiple parties without revealing the plaintexts. This approach is particularly useful in VFL settings where a trusted third-party server is not available. By combining secret sharing with homomorphic encryption, EFMVFL [3] achieves significant acceleration of the training procedure in vertical federated linear models. Another example is HashVFL [5], which integrates hashing to counter data reconstruction attacks while maintaining task performance.\n\nHomomorphic encryption is another technique used to ensure data security and privacy in VFL. However, existing industrial frameworks employing homomorphic encryption suffer from expensive computation and communication overhead, particularly in VFL settings [1]. To address this issue, researchers have proposed novel approaches, such as VERTICES [1], which presents a two-party vertical federated linear model via an efficient secret sharing scheme with a trusted coordinator. This approach achieves significant acceleration of the training procedure.\n\nZeroth-order optimization is also a desirable companion for VFL, as it can improve the model applicability of VFL frameworks, prevent privacy leakage, and support inexpensive communication and efficient computation [4]. The AsyREVEL algorithms proposed in [4] demonstrate favorable model applicability, satisfied privacy security, inexpensive communication, efficient computation, scalability, and losslessness.\n\nDespite these advancements, implementing communication efficiency techniques in multi-party settings poses several challenges. One key challenge is the need for a trusted third-party server, which can be difficult to find in real-world scenarios [3]. Another challenge is the vanishing gradients and information loss issues that arise when implementing hashing in VFL [5]. Furthermore, the complexity of modern integrated circuits necessitates collaboration between multiple distrusting parties, jeopardizing confidentiality and integrity of each party's IP [6]. Therefore, secure multi-party computation techniques, such as those proposed in [6], are essential to maintain privacy and security.\n\nIn conclusion, the development of communication efficiency techniques in VFL frameworks has been an active area of research, with various approaches proposed to address the challenges of communication efficiency and data security. However, implementing these techniques in multi-party settings remains a complex task, requiring careful consideration of the trade-offs between security, privacy, and efficiency.\n\n**********\n\n## Question 3\n\nWhat are the current limitations and challenges in evaluating the robustness of VFL systems against various types of attacks, and how have these limitations been addressed in recent studies?\n\n### Passage\n\n[0] Title: Constructing Adversarial Examples for Vertical Federated Learning: Optimal Client Corruption through Multi-Armed Bandit **--**Text: Vertical federated learning (VFL), where each participating client holds a subset of data features, has found numerous applications in finance, healthcare, and IoT systems. However, adversarial attacks, particularly through the injection of adversarial examples (AEs), pose serious challenges to the security of VFL models. In this paper, we investigate such vulnerabilities through developing a novel attack to disrupt the VFL inference process, under a practical scenario where the adversary is able to adaptively corrupt a subset of clients. We formulate the problem of finding optimal attack strategies as an online optimization problem, which is decomposed into an inner problem of adversarial example generation (AEG) and an outer problem of corruption pattern selection (CPS). Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the formulated CPS problem and a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose the Thompson sampling with Empirical maximum reward (E-TS) algorithm for the adversary to efficiently identify the optimal subset of clients for corruption. The key idea of E-TS is to introduce an estimation of the expected maximum reward for each arm, which helps to specify a small set of competitive arms, on which the exploration for the optimal arm is performed. This significantly reduces the exploration space, which otherwise can quickly become prohibitively large as the number of clients increases. We analytically characterize the regret bound of E-TS, and empirically demonstrate its capability of efficiently revealing the optimal corruption pattern with the highest attack success rate, under various datasets of popular VFL tasks.\n[1] Title: Mutual Information Regularization for Vertical Federated Learning **--**Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is widely utilized in real-world applications to enable collaborative learning while protecting data privacy and safety. However, previous works show that parties without labels (passive parties) in VFL can infer the sensitive label information owned by the party with labels (active party) or execute backdoor attacks to VFL. Meanwhile, active party can also infer sensitive feature information from passive party. All these pose new privacy and security challenges to VFL systems. We propose a new general defense method which limits the mutual information between private raw data, including both features and labels, and intermediate outputs to achieve a better trade-off between model utility and privacy. We term this defense Mutual Information Regularization Defense (MID). We theoretically and experimentally testify the effectiveness of our MID method in defending existing attacks in VFL, including label inference attacks, backdoor attacks and feature reconstruction attacks.\n[2] Title: A Practical Clean-Label Backdoor Attack with Limited Information in Vertical Federated Learning **--**Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) facilitates collaboration on model training among multiple parties, each owning partitioned features of the distributed dataset. Although backdoor attacks have been found as one of the main threats to FL security, research on backdoor attacks in VFL is still in the infant stage. Existing methods for VFL backdoor attacks rely on predicting sample pseudo-labels using approaches such as label inference, which require substantial additional information not readily available in practical FL scenarios. To evaluate the practical vulnerability of VFL to backdoor attacks, we present a target-efficient clean backdoor (TECB) attack for VFL. The TECB approach consists of two phases \u2013 i) Clean Backdoor Poisoning (CBP) and Target Gradient Alignment (TGA). In the CBP phase, the adversary trains a backdoor trigger and poisons the model during VFL training. The poisoned model is further fine-tuned in the TGA phase to enhance its efficacy in complex multi-classification tasks. Compared to the existing methods, the proposed TECB achieves a highly effective backdoor attack with very limited information about the target class samples, which is more practical in typical VFL settings. Experimental results verify the superior performance of TECB, achieving above 97% attack success rate (ASR) on three widely used datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and CINIC-10) with only 0.1% of target labels known, which outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods. This study uncovers the potential backdoor risks in VFL, enabling the development of secure VFL applications in areas like finance, healthcare, and beyond. Source code is available at: https://github.com/13thDayOLunarMay/TECB-attack\n[3] Title: PlugVFL: Robust and IP-Protecting Vertical Federated Learning against Unexpected Quitting of Parties **--**Text: In federated learning systems, the unexpected quitting of participants is inevitable. Such quittings generally do not incur serious consequences in horizontal federated learning (HFL), but they do damage to vertical federated learning (VFL), which has been underexplored in previous research. In this paper, we show that there are two major vulnerabilities when passive parties unexpectedly quit in the deployment phase of VFL \u2014 severe performance degradation and intellectual property (IP) leakage of the active party\u2019s labels. To solve these issues, we design PlugVFL to improve the VFL model\u2019s robustness against the unexpected exit of passive parties and protect the active party\u2019s IP in the deployment phase simultaneously. We evaluate our framework on multiple datasets against different inference attacks. The results show that PlugVFL effectively maintains model performance after the passive party quits and successfully disguises label information from the passive party\u2019s feature extractor, thereby mitigating IP leakage.\n[4] Title: Practical and General Backdoor Attacks against Vertical Federated Learning **--**Text: Federated learning (FL), which aims to facilitate data collaboration across multiple organizations without exposing data privacy, encounters potential security risks. One serious threat is backdoor attacks, where an attacker injects a specific trigger into the training dataset to manipulate the model's prediction. Most existing FL backdoor attacks are based on horizontal federated learning (HFL), where the data owned by different parties have the same features. However, compared to HFL, backdoor attacks on vertical federated learning (VFL), where each party only holds a disjoint subset of features and the labels are only owned by one party, are rarely studied. The main challenge of this attack is to allow an attacker without access to the data labels, to perform an effective attack. To this end, we propose BadVFL, a novel and practical approach to inject backdoor triggers into victim models without label information. BadVFL mainly consists of two key steps. First, to address the challenge of attackers having no knowledge of labels, we introduce a SDD module that can trace data categories based on gradients. Second, we propose a SDP module that can improve the attack's effectiveness by enhancing the decision dependency between the trigger and attack target. Extensive experiments show that BadVFL supports diverse datasets and models, and achieves over 93% attack success rate with only 1% poisoning rate.\n[5] Title: Secure Vertical Federated Learning Under Unreliable Connectivity **--**Text: Most work in privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) has focused on horizontally partitioned datasets where clients hold the same features and train complete client-level models independently. However, individual data points are often scattered across different institutions, known as clients, in vertical FL (VFL) settings. Addressing this category of FL necessitates the exchange of intermediate outputs and gradients among participants, resulting in potential privacy leakage risks and slow convergence rates. Additionally, in many real-world scenarios, VFL training also faces the acute issue of client stragglers and drop-outs, a serious challenge that can significantly hinder the training process but has been largely overlooked in existing studies. In this work, we present vFedSec, a first dropout-tolerant VFL protocol, which can support the most generalized vertical framework. It achieves secure and efficient model training by using an innovative Secure Layer alongside an embedding-padding technique. We provide theoretical proof that our design attains enhanced security while maintaining training performance. Empirical results from extensive experiments also demonstrate vFedSec is robust to client dropout and provides secure training with negligible computation and communication overhead. Compared to widely adopted homomorphic encryption (HE) methods, our approach achieves a remarkable>690x speedup and reduces communication costs significantly by>9.6x.\n[6] Title: HashVFL: Defending Against Data Reconstruction Attacks in Vertical Federated Learning **--**Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a trending collaborative machine learning model training solution. Existing industrial frameworks employ secure multi-party computation techniques such as homomorphic encryption to ensure data security and privacy. Despite these efforts, studies have revealed that data leakage remains a risk in VFL due to the correlations between intermediate representations and raw data. Neural networks can accurately capture these correlations, allowing an adversary to reconstruct the data. This emphasizes the need for continued research into securing VFL systems. Our work shows that hashing is a promising solution to counter data reconstruction attacks. The one-way nature of hashing makes it difficult for an adversary to recover data from hash codes. However, implementing hashing in VFL presents new challenges, including vanishing gradients and information loss. To address these issues, we propose HashVFL, which integrates hashing and simultaneously achieves learnability, bit balance, and consistency. Experimental results indicate that HashVFL effectively maintains task performance while defending against data reconstruction attacks. It also brings additional benefits in reducing the degree of label leakage, mitigating adversarial attacks, and detecting abnormal inputs. We hope our work will inspire further research into the potential applications of HashVFL.\n[7] Title: A Unified Solution for Privacy and Communication Efficiency in Vertical Federated Learning **--**Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm that enables multiple participants to jointly train a model on their private data without sharing it. To make VFL practical, privacy security and communication efficiency should both be satisfied. Recent research has shown that Zero-Order Optimization (ZOO) in VFL can effectively conceal the internal information of the model without adding costly privacy protective add-ons, making it a promising approach for privacy and efficiency. However, there are still two key problems that have yet to be resolved. First, the convergence rate of ZOO-based VFL is significantly slower compared to gradient-based VFL, resulting in low efficiency in model training and more communication round, which hinders its application on large neural networks. Second, although ZOO-based VFL has demonstrated resistance to state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks, its privacy guarantee lacks a theoretical explanation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cascaded hybrid optimization approach that employs a zeroth-order (ZO) gradient on the most critical output layer of the clients, with other parts utilizing the first-order (FO) gradient. This approach preserves the privacy protection of ZOO while significantly enhancing convergence. Moreover, we theoretically prove that applying ZOO to the VFL is equivalent to adding Gaussian Mechanism to the gradient information, which offers an implicit differential privacy guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves similar utility as the Gaussian mechanism under the same privacy budget, while also having significantly lower communication costs compared with SOTA communication-efficient VFL frameworks.\n[8] Title: Complementary Knowledge Distillation for Robust and Privacy-Preserving Model Serving in Vertical Federated Learning **--**Text: Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) enables an active party with labeled data to enhance model performance (utility) by collaborating with multiple passive parties that possess auxiliary features corresponding to the same sample identifiers (IDs). Model serving in VFL is vital for real-world, delay-sensitive applications, and it faces two major challenges: 1) robustness against arbitrarily-aligned data and stragglers; and 2) privacy protection, ensuring minimal label leakage to passive parties. Existing methods fail to transfer knowledge among parties to improve robustness in a privacy-preserving way. In this paper, we introduce a privacy-preserving knowledge transfer framework, Complementary Knowledge Distillation (CKD), designed to enhance the robustness and privacy of multi-party VFL systems. Specifically, we formulate a Complementary Label Coding (CLC) objective to encode only complementary label information of the active party's local model for passive parties to learn. Then, CKD selectively transfers the CLC-encoded complementary knowledge 1) from the passive parties to the active party, and 2) among the passive parties themselves. Experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that CKD outperforms existing approaches in terms of robustness against arbitrarily-aligned data, while also minimizing label privacy leakage.\n[9] Title: Hijack Vertical Federated Learning Models with Adversarial Embedding **--**Text: Vertical federated learning (VFL) is an emerging paradigm that enables collaborators to build machine learning models together in a distributed fashion. In general, these parties have a group of users in common but own different features. Existing VFL frameworks use cryptographic techniques to provide data privacy and security guarantees, leading to a line of works studying computing efficiency and fast implementation. However, the security of VFL\u2019s model remains underexplored. On the other hand, recent years have witnessed the explosive growth of deep neural networks (DNNs) in industry. However, a line of works has revealed they are fragile to two attack vectors, i.e., adversarial and poisoning attacks, which aim to induce the model to give expected predictions of adversaries. Following this, a natural and interesting question is how harmful are these attacks to VFL? Our pre-study finds that existing attacks suffer from high performance degradation under VFL\u2019s mechanism. One important reason is that the multiparty collaboration mechanism weakens the adversary\u2019s influence on the final prediction results. After analyzing the challenges encountered by these attacks, we propose two new attacks, i.e., replay attack and generation attack , against VFL to reveal its potential risks of being maliciously manipulated by one participant. Specifically, the former searches for benign robust features in existing samples to determine the desired class, while the latter obtains them through adversarial generation. Furthermore, to avoid these features being suppressed by the features of other parties, we take the joint force of adversarial and poisoning attacks, i.e., implanting \u2018trigger-like\u2019 features in training. Finally, the adversary combines the robust features with the implanted trigger-like features to replace a target sample\u2019s features, which results in the adversary\u2019s desired prediction. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our attacks, e.g., the adversary holding only 10% of the features can achieve an attack success rate close to\n\n\n### Answer\n\nEvaluating the robustness of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) systems against various types of attacks is a challenging task, and several limitations and challenges have been identified in recent studies. One major limitation is the lack of a unified framework for evaluating the robustness of VFL systems against different types of attacks, such as backdoor attacks, data reconstruction attacks, and adversarial attacks [4][9]. Another challenge is the difficulty in quantifying the impact of attacks on VFL systems, as the effects of attacks can be subtle and may not always be immediately apparent [3][5].\n\nTo address these limitations, recent studies have proposed various methods for evaluating the robustness of VFL systems. For example, [0] proposes a novel attack to disrupt the VFL inference process, which is formulated as an online optimization problem and solved using a Thompson sampling with Empirical maximum reward (E-TS) algorithm. This approach allows for the efficient identification of the optimal subset of clients for corruption, resulting in a high attack success rate.\n\nAnother approach is to use mutual information regularization to limit the mutual information between private raw data and intermediate outputs, as proposed in [1]. This method has been shown to be effective in defending against label inference attacks, backdoor attacks, and feature reconstruction attacks. Additionally, [2] proposes a target-efficient clean backdoor (TECB) attack for VFL, which achieves a high attack success rate with only 0.1% of target labels known.\n\nTo address the challenge of evaluating the robustness of VFL systems against data reconstruction attacks, [6] proposes a hashing-based approach called HashVFL, which integrates hashing and simultaneously achieves learnability, bit balance, and consistency. This approach has been shown to effectively maintain task performance while defending against data reconstruction attacks.\n\nFurthermore, [7] proposes a cascaded hybrid optimization approach that employs a zeroth-order (ZO) gradient on the most critical output layer of the clients, with other parts utilizing the first-order (FO) gradient. This approach preserves the privacy protection of ZOO while significantly enhancing convergence, and provides a theoretical explanation for the privacy guarantee.\n\nFinally, [8] proposes a privacy-preserving knowledge transfer framework called Complementary Knowledge Distillation (CKD), which is designed to enhance the robustness and privacy of multi-party VFL systems. This approach selectively transfers the CLC-encoded complementary knowledge from the passive parties to the active party, and among the passive parties themselves, resulting in improved robustness against arbitrarily-aligned data and minimized label privacy leakage.\n\nIn summary, recent studies have proposed various methods for evaluating the robustness of VFL systems against different types of attacks, including backdoor attacks, data reconstruction attacks, and adversarial attacks. These methods include mutual information regularization, hashing-based approaches, cascaded hybrid optimization, and privacy-preserving knowledge transfer frameworks. These approaches have been shown to be effective in defending against various types of attacks and improving the robustness of VFL systems.\n\n**********\n\n"}], "output": "Thank you for your help!

The authors implement 13 datasets, 29 local model architectures, 6 global models, 2 model partition settings, 5 communication protocols, 10 attacks and 7 defenses. The experiments and analyses are extensive.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3 good\n\n### Presentation\n\n3 good\n\n### Contribution\n\n3 good\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The system contains many state-of-the-art VFL methods, which can serve as a good benchmark and facilitate future research in VFL.\n\n2. The experiments and analyses are extensive.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The novelty of the paper is limited. The authors implement some existing methods and conduct experiments. The paper is more like a system paper, but there is no implementation details provided.\n\n2. The authors only evaluate the model utility and the defense performance. However, there is no theoretical contribution.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit significantly from a more detailed discussion of the implementation choices made in the benchmark. While the inclusion of numerous state-of-the-art methods is valuable, the lack of specifics regarding how these methods were adapted and integrated into the VFL framework makes it difficult to assess the practical contributions of the work. For example, the paper should elaborate on the specific challenges encountered when implementing different model architectures within the VFL setting, such as handling varying input dimensions or ensuring consistent gradient updates across parties. Furthermore, a discussion of the computational overhead associated with each method would be beneficial for users of the benchmark. Providing insights into the trade-offs between model complexity, communication costs, and defense effectiveness would greatly enhance the practical utility of the benchmark. The authors should also consider including a section that outlines the specific hardware and software configurations used for the experiments, as this can significantly impact the reproducibility of the results.\n\nTo strengthen the paper's contribution, the authors should consider exploring the theoretical underpinnings of the observed empirical results. While the primary focus is on empirical evaluation, a deeper understanding of why certain defenses are more effective against specific attacks would add significant value. For instance, the authors could investigate the relationship between the properties of the defense mechanisms and their ability to mitigate specific types of attacks. This could involve analyzing the gradient masking effects of certain defenses or the robustness of different model architectures to adversarial perturbations. Such analysis could be done by examining the loss landscapes of the models under different attacks and defenses, which could provide insights into the effectiveness of different defense strategies. This would not only enhance the theoretical contribution of the paper but also provide a more solid foundation for future research in the field.\n\nFinally, the paper should include a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the benchmark. While the authors have made a commendable effort to include a wide range of methods, it is important to acknowledge that the benchmark is not exhaustive. For example, the benchmark could be expanded to include more complex data modalities, such as time-series data or graph data, which are increasingly relevant in VFL applications. Additionally, the benchmark could be extended to include more sophisticated attack strategies, such as those that exploit the communication protocols or the model aggregation process. By acknowledging these limitations, the authors can provide a more realistic assessment of the benchmark's capabilities and guide future research efforts in this area.\n\n### Questions\n\n1.

VFL is a collaborative training paradigm where participants with different features of the same group of users can train models without exposing their raw data or model parameters. The authors benchmark 11 attacks and 8 defenses under different communication and model partition settings and draw concrete insights and recommendations on the choice of defense strategies for different practical VFL deployment scenarios.\n\n### Soundness\n\n3 good\n\n### Presentation\n\n3 good\n\n### Contribution\n\n3 good\n\n### Strengths\n\n1. The paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of various defense methods against different types of attacks in VFL, which is crucial for understanding the effectiveness of these defenses in practical deployment scenarios.\n\n2. The paper introduces a new evaluation metric, Defense Capability Score (DCS), to directly compare all the defenses under one unified metric. This metric takes into account both the attack performance (AP) and the main task performance (MP) of the VFL system.\n\n3. The paper provides insights into the trade-offs between model utility and defense effectiveness, which is essential for choosing the right defense strategy in practical VFL deployments.\n\n### Weaknesses\n\n#### Some Related Works\n\n\n#### comment\n\n1. The paper focuses on evaluating existing defense methods and does not propose any new defense techniques. While the evaluation of existing methods is valuable, the lack of novel contributions in terms of defense mechanisms may limit the paper's impact.\n\n2. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead of the proposed defense methods. This is an important factor to consider in practical deployments, especially in resource-constrained environments.\n\n3. The paper does not explore the potential vulnerabilities of the proposed defense methods to more advanced attacks. It is important to consider the robustness of these defenses against sophisticated adversaries.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit from a more in-depth analysis of the computational costs associated with the evaluated defense methods. While the authors mention the importance of this factor, they do not provide concrete data on the computational overhead. For example, it would be useful to see a breakdown of the time and memory requirements for each defense method, as well as how these costs scale with the size of the dataset and the complexity of the model. This analysis should include not only the training time but also the inference time, as some defenses might introduce significant latency during prediction. Furthermore, the authors should consider the impact of these computational costs on different hardware platforms, such as GPUs and TPUs, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the practical implications of using these defenses.\n\nIn addition to the computational overhead, the paper should also explore the robustness of the proposed defense methods against more advanced attacks. The current evaluation focuses on a set of existing attacks, but it does not consider the potential for adaptive adversaries to circumvent these defenses. For example, an adversary might be able to combine multiple attacks or develop new attack strategies that are specifically designed to target the weaknesses of the evaluated defenses. The authors should consider exploring the use of adversarial training techniques to improve the robustness of the defenses against such advanced attacks. This could involve training the models on adversarial examples generated by more sophisticated attack methods, or using techniques such as robust optimization to minimize the impact of adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the potential for attacks that exploit the communication protocols used in VFL, such as man-in-the-middle attacks or replay attacks.\n\nFinally, the paper should provide more concrete guidance on how to choose the appropriate defense strategy for different practical VFL deployment scenarios. While the authors mention the trade-offs between model utility and defense effectiveness, they do not provide specific recommendations on how to balance these factors in real-world applications. For example, the authors could provide a decision tree or a set of guidelines that help practitioners select the most suitable defense method based on their specific needs and constraints. This guidance should consider factors such as the sensitivity of the data, the computational resources available, and the desired level of security. The authors should also consider the potential for combining different defense methods to achieve a better balance between utility and security. For example, a combination of differential privacy and adversarial training might provide a more robust defense against a wider range of attacks.\n\n### Questions\n\n1. How do the proposed defense methods perform against more advanced attacks that are specifically designed to target these defenses?\n\n2. What is the computational overhead of the proposed defense methods, and how does it impact the scalability of VFL systems?\n\n3. How do the proposed defense methods affect the convergence rate and stability of VFL training?\n\n4. How do the proposed defense methods perform in real-world VFL deployment scenarios, and what are the practical challenges of implementing these defenses in such settings?\n\n### Rating\n\n6: marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n### Confidence\n\n3: You are fairly confident in your assessment.

The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead of the proposed framework and the impact of different defense methods on the training time and communication costs.\n2. The evaluation of the framework is limited to a small number of datasets and model architectures.

The paper does not discuss the limitations of the proposed framework and potential future research directions in detail.\n\n### Suggestions\n\nThe paper would benefit from a more thorough analysis of the computational overhead associated with the proposed VFL framework. Specifically, the authors should provide a breakdown of the time spent on different stages of the training process, such as forward and backward propagation, communication, and encryption/decryption. This analysis should be conducted for various model architectures and datasets to understand how these factors influence the overall training time.

For example, the authors could measure the increase in training time and communication costs when using techniques like gradient perturbation or homomorphic encryption. This detailed analysis would allow practitioners to make informed decisions about the trade-offs between security and efficiency when deploying the framework in real-world scenarios. It would also be beneficial to explore optimization techniques to mitigate the computational overhead of the defense methods.\n\nTo strengthen the evaluation of the framework, the authors should consider expanding the range of datasets and model architectures used in the experiments. While the current evaluation includes three datasets, it would be beneficial to include datasets with varying characteristics, such as different data modalities (e.g., images, text, time series) and different data sizes. This would help to assess the generalizability of the framework and identify potential limitations. Similarly, the evaluation should include a wider range of model architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers, to demonstrate the framework's versatility. Furthermore, the authors should consider evaluating the framework's performance on more complex tasks, such as multi-label classification or regression problems. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the framework's capabilities and limitations.\n\nFinally, the paper should include a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed framework and potential future research directions. The authors should acknowledge the challenges of deploying VFL in real-world scenarios, such as the need for robust security mechanisms and the difficulty of handling heterogeneous data distributions. They should also discuss the limitations of the current evaluation, such as the limited number of datasets and model architectures. Furthermore, the authors should outline potential future research directions, such as the development of more efficient and robust defense methods, the exploration of new VFL architectures, and the application of VFL to new domains.

While the current evaluation includes three datasets, it would be beneficial to include datasets with varying characteristics, such as different data modalities (e.g., images, text, time series) and different data sizes. This would help to assess the generalizability of the framework and identify potential limitations. Similarly, the evaluation should include a wider range of model architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers, to demonstrate the framework's versatility. Furthermore, the authors should consider evaluating the framework's performance on more complex tasks, such as multi-label classification or regression problems. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the framework's capabilities and limitations.\n\nFinally, the paper should include a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed framework and potential future research directions. The authors should acknowledge the challenges of deploying VFL in real-world scenarios, such as the need for robust security mechanisms and the difficulty of handling heterogeneous data distributions. They should also discuss the limitations of the current evaluation, such as the limited number of datasets and model architectures. Furthermore, the authors should outline potential future research directions, such as the development of more efficient and robust defense methods, the exploration of new VFL architectures, and the application of VFL to new domains. This discussion would provide valuable insights for researchers in the field and help to guide future research efforts.\n\n### Questions\n\nPlease refer to the weaknesses.\n\n### Rating\n\n6: marginally above the acceptance threshold\n\n### Confidence\n\n3: You are fairly confident in your assessment.

Next, I will organize this content and output the final review decision:\n\n\\boxed_review{\n## Summary:\n\nThis paper introduces VFLAIR, a lightweight and extensible framework for Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), designed to facilitate research and practical deployment. The core contribution of this work lies in the creation of a comprehensive benchmark for VFL, encompassing a wide range of models, datasets, communication protocols, and, crucially, various attack and defense strategies. The authors implement 29 local model architectures, 6 global models, and 5 communication protocols, alongside 11 different attack methods and 8 defense mechanisms. The framework supports 13 datasets, including image, text, and tabular data, allowing for a diverse set of experiments. The authors benchmark the performance of these components under different communication and model partition settings, aiming to provide insights and recommendations on the choice of defense strategies for different practical VFL deployment scenarios. The empirical findings include evaluations of model utility, defense performance, and the computational overhead of different configurations. The paper introduces new evaluation metrics, such as Defense Capability Score (DCS), Type-level DCS (T-DCS), and Comprehensive DCS (C-DCS), to assess the effectiveness of defense methods. The authors also explore the trade-offs between model utility and defense effectiveness, providing concrete recommendations for practitioners. The paper's significance lies in its attempt to provide a unified platform for VFL research, addressing the need for a comprehensive benchmark that includes a wide range of methods and scenarios. However, the paper's primary focus is on implementation and empirical evaluation, with limited theoretical contributions. The authors acknowledge the limitations of the current implementation, particularly in terms of cryptographic techniques, and suggest future directions for improvement. Overall, the paper presents a valuable contribution to the VFL community by providing a practical framework and benchmark, but it also highlights areas where further research is needed.\n\n\n## Soundness:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Presentation:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Contribution:\n\n3.0\n\n\n## Strengths:\n\nI find several strengths in this paper, primarily centered around its contribution to the practical application and benchmarking of Vertical Federated Learning (VFL). The most significant strength is the development of VFLAIR, a lightweight and extensible VFL framework. This framework, as the authors describe, includes a wide array of VFL components, such as 29 local model architectures, 6 global models, and 5 communication protocols. This comprehensive collection of components, coupled with the support for 13 diverse datasets, makes VFLAIR a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners alike. The inclusion of 11 attack methods and 8 defense mechanisms further enhances the framework's utility as a benchmarking tool. The authors have clearly put considerable effort into implementing state-of-the-art VFL methods, which is a non-trivial undertaking. The empirical evaluation is another strong point. The authors conduct extensive experiments, benchmarking the performance of various VFL settings, including model partitioning, communication protocols, and defense strategies. The introduction of new evaluation metrics, such as DCS, T-DCS, and C-DCS, is a positive step towards a more nuanced understanding of defense effectiveness. These metrics allow for a more comprehensive assessment of the trade-offs between model utility and defense performance. The paper also provides concrete recommendations on the choice of defense strategies for different practical VFL deployment scenarios, which is particularly helpful for practitioners. The authors have clearly identified a need for a comprehensive VFL benchmark and have made a commendable effort to address this gap. The framework's extensibility is also a notable strength, as it allows for future additions and modifications, ensuring its continued relevance to the VFL community. The paper's focus on practical deployment scenarios is also a positive aspect, as it highlights the real-world applicability of the research. The authors have successfully created a valuable tool that can facilitate further research and development in the field of VFL.\n\n\n## Weaknesses:\n\nDespite the strengths of this paper, I have identified several weaknesses that warrant careful consideration. First, the paper's novelty is limited. While the implementation of a comprehensive VFL framework is a valuable contribution, the paper does not introduce any novel defense techniques. As I've verified, the authors explicitly state that they implement and benchmark existing methods, rather than proposing new ones. This focus on implementation and empirical evaluation, while useful, positions the paper more as a system paper than a theoretical contribution. The lack of detailed implementation specifics further reinforces this perception. Second, the paper lacks a significant theoretical contribution. The focus is primarily on empirical evaluation and benchmarking, with no in-depth theoretical analysis or proofs. While the introduction of new evaluation metrics is a contribution, it is still within the realm of empirical analysis. The paper does not delve into the theoretical underpinnings of the observed empirical results, such as the relationship between the properties of the defense mechanisms and their ability to mitigate specific types of attacks. Third, the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational overhead of the proposed defense methods. While the authors include 'Execution Time' as a metric in some experiments, this is primarily for comparing the overall training time with and without encryption for tree-based models. There is no detailed breakdown of the computational overhead introduced by each individual defense method. This is a significant omission, as the computational cost of defense methods is a crucial factor to consider in practical deployments, especially in resource-constrained environments. Fourth, the paper does not explore the potential vulnerabilities of the proposed defense methods to more advanced attacks. The evaluation is limited to a set of 11 specific attacks, which are established attacks but not necessarily adaptive attacks designed to circumvent these specific defenses. The paper does not consider the robustness of these defenses against sophisticated adversaries who might develop new attack strategies to target the weaknesses of the evaluated defenses. Fifth, the evaluation of the framework is limited to a relatively small number of datasets and model architectures. While the paper includes 13 datasets and 29 local model architectures, a wider range of datasets and models would further demonstrate the framework's generalizability. The current selection, while diverse, could be expanded to include more complex data modalities and tasks. Finally, the paper lacks a detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed framework and potential future research directions. While the 'Conclusions and Limitations' section briefly mentions some limitations, it does not provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges of deploying VFL in real-world scenarios, such as the need for robust security mechanisms and the difficulty of handling heterogeneous data distributions. The paper also does not thoroughly outline potential future research directions, such as the development of more efficient and robust defense methods or the exploration of new VFL architectures. These limitations, taken together, suggest that while the paper makes a valuable contribution in terms of a practical framework, it falls short in terms of theoretical depth, computational analysis, and exploration of advanced attack scenarios. My confidence in these identified weaknesses is high, as they are directly supported by the paper's content and lack of specific details in the areas mentioned.\n\n\n## Suggestions:\n\nBased on the identified weaknesses, I recommend several concrete improvements to enhance the paper's contribution. First, the authors should conduct a more in-depth analysis of the computational overhead associated with the proposed VFL framework, particularly the defense methods. This analysis should include a breakdown of the time spent on different stages of the training process, such as forward and backward propagation, communication, and encryption/decryption. This analysis should be conducted for various model architectures and datasets to understand how these factors influence the overall training time. Furthermore, the impact of different defense methods on the computational cost should be quantified. For example, the authors could measure the increase in training time and communication costs when using techniques like gradient perturbation or homomorphic encryption. This detailed analysis would allow practitioners to make informed decisions about the trade-offs between security and efficiency when deploying the framework in real-world scenarios. It would also be beneficial to explore optimization techniques to mitigate the computational overhead of the defense methods. Second, the authors should expand the evaluation of the framework to include a wider range of datasets and model architectures. While the current evaluation includes 13 datasets and 29 local model architectures, it would be beneficial to include datasets with varying characteristics, such as different data modalities (e.g., images, text, time series) and different data sizes. This would help to assess the generalizability of the framework and identify potential limitations. Similarly, the evaluation should include a wider range of model architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and transformers, to demonstrate the framework's versatility. Furthermore, the authors should consider evaluating the framework's performance on more complex tasks, such as multi-label classification or regression problems. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the framework's capabilities and limitations. Third, the authors should explore the potential vulnerabilities of the proposed defense methods to more advanced attacks. This could involve considering adaptive attacks that are specifically designed to circumvent the defenses. The authors should also consider exploring the use of adversarial training techniques to improve the robustness of the defenses against such advanced attacks. This could involve training the models on adversarial examples generated by more sophisticated attack methods, or using techniques such as robust optimization to minimize the impact of adversarial perturbations. Furthermore, the authors should investigate the potential for attacks that exploit the communication protocols used in VFL, such as man-in-the-middle attacks or replay attacks. Fourth, the authors should include a more detailed discussion of the limitations of the proposed framework and potential future research directions. The authors should acknowledge the challenges of deploying VFL in real-world scenarios, such as the need for robust security mechanisms and the difficulty of handling heterogeneous data distributions. They should also discuss the limitations of the current evaluation, such as the limited number of datasets and model architectures. Furthermore, the authors should outline potential future research directions, such as the development of more efficient and robust defense methods, the exploration of new VFL architectures, and the application of VFL to new domains. This discussion would provide valuable insights for researchers in the field and help to guide future research efforts. Finally, the authors should consider adding more implementation details to the paper, such as code snippets or architectural diagrams of the framework itself. This would make the paper more useful for researchers who want to use the framework and would also help to clarify the technical contributions of the work. These suggestions, if implemented, would significantly strengthen the paper and make it a more valuable contribution to the VFL community.\n\n\n## Questions:\n\nBased on my analysis, I have several questions that I believe are crucial for a deeper understanding of the paper's contributions and limitations. First, how do the proposed defense methods perform against more advanced attacks that are specifically designed to target these defenses? The current evaluation focuses on a set of existing attacks, but it does not consider the potential for adaptive adversaries to circumvent these defenses. Understanding the robustness of the defenses against such advanced attacks is crucial for assessing their practical utility. Second, what is the computational overhead of the proposed defense methods, and how does it impact the scalability of VFL systems? The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the computational cost of each defense method, which is a critical factor to consider in practical deployments, especially in resource-constrained environments. A detailed breakdown of the time spent on different stages of the training process, such as forward and backward propagation, communication, and encryption/decryption, would be beneficial. Third, how do the proposed defense methods affect the convergence rate and stability of VFL training? The paper does not explore the impact of the defense methods on the training dynamics, which is an important aspect to consider. Understanding how these methods affect the convergence rate and stability of the training process is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the framework. Fourth, how do the proposed defense methods perform in real-world VFL deployment scenarios, and what are the practical challenges of implementing these defenses in such settings? The paper focuses on benchmarking in a controlled environment, but it does not address the practical challenges of deploying these defenses in real-world scenarios, such as handling heterogeneous data distributions and dealing with communication constraints. Fifth, what are the potential limitations of the proposed framework, and what are the future research directions that the authors envision? The paper briefly mentions some limitations, but a more detailed discussion of the challenges of deploying VFL in real-world scenarios and the potential future research directions would be valuable. Finally, how does the proposed framework compare to other existing VFL frameworks in terms of performance, scalability, and security? A comparative analysis with other existing frameworks would provide a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of VFLAIR. These questions, I believe, are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the paper's contributions and limitations and would help to guide future research in this area.\n\n\n## Rating:\n\n6.0\n\n\n## Confidence:\n\n3.5\n\n\n## Decision:\n\nAccept\n}"}}]
